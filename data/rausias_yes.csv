Context: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has warned states against fiscal slippages , rising borrowing, and pre-election populist spending , highlighting risks to long-term financial stability. Pre-election populist spending refers to the increase in subsidies and welfare outlays mainly to attract voter support , rather than to promote sustained economic growth. Key Concerns Highlighted by RBI Rising Borrowing Costs: Yields on State Development Loans (SDLs) have risen sharply. Higher yields mean states must pay more interest , increasing the overall debt burden. Increasing Market Borrowing: States have borrowed ₹5.23 trillion till October 2025 , which is 62% of their FY26 borrowing plan , compared to ₹4.37 trillion in the same period last year. This indicates faster-than-expected fiscal stress . Fiscal Deficit Pressure: The combined fiscal deficit for states is expected to be 3.2% of GDP . However, analysts caution that pre-election expenditure could push this above the recommended limits , threatening fiscal stability. Pre-Election Populist Spending: During eight state elections (2023–25) , states spent nearly ₹68,000 crore on short-term welfare schemes. For example, Bihar allocated 32.48% of its tax revenues to such schemes, reducing funds available for infrastructure and long-term development. What are SDLs? State Development Loans (SDLs) are bonds issued by state governments to raise funds for development expenses and fiscal deficit management. These are auctioned by the RBI and carry interest, contributing to long-term debt liabilities of states. RBI Recommendations Recommendation Purpose Productive Spending Shift funds from temporary subsidies toward capital expenditure (roads, power, irrigation) that builds future growth. Fiscal Prudence Adhere to FRBM Act targets to maintain balanced budgets and macroeconomic stability. Borrowing Strategy Spread borrowings across maturities and maintain transparent communication to lower interest costs. Fiscal Transparency Clearly report contingent liabilities and off-budget borrowings to avoid hidden debt risks. Why This Matters States account for nearly 60% of public sector capital expenditure in India. Excessive populist spending reduces funds for development , slowing growth and worsening debt sustainability. Maintaining fiscal discipline strengthens investor confidence , supports stable interest rates , and ensures inter-generational equity . Conclusion RBI’s caution underscores the importance of sustainable fiscal management . While welfare spending remains essential, states must prioritize long-term developmental spending and maintain transparent and prudent financial practices to safeguard economic stability.",,,RAU IAS;Editorial Analysis;Current Affairs,https://compass.rauias.com/2025/11/01/

Context: According to the Russian Ministry of Defence and the Nuclear Observation Agency (NOA) , Russia has successfully tested its nuclear-powered, nuclear-armed underwater drone — Poseidon . It represents a new class of Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) capable of strategic nuclear delivery with unprecedented endurance and stealth. About Poseidon Type: Nuclear-powered, nuclear-capable Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV). Developer: Rubin Design Bureau, Russia. Objective: To deliver conventional or nuclear payloads across intercontinental distances and potentially generate radioactive tsunamis capable of destroying coastal cities and naval bases. Power Source: A miniaturized nuclear reactor , giving Poseidon virtually unlimited operational range and the ability to patrol underwater for months without surfacing. Launch Platform: Poseidon is designed to be carried and launched from special-purpose submarines such as the Belgorod (Project 09852) and Khabarovsk (Project 09851) . Technical Specifications (as reported) Parameter Details Range Practically unlimited (due to nuclear propulsion) Speed Up to 100 knots (~185 km/h) Operational Depth > 1,000 meters Length ~20 meters Diameter ~2 meters Payload Up to 2 megatons (nuclear warhead) Strategic Significance Second-Strike Capability: Poseidon enhances Russia’s nuclear deterrence by ensuring a second-strike option even if land-based systems are neutralized. Stealth and Survivability: Operating at great depths and high speeds, Poseidon is difficult to detect or intercept with existing sonar or anti-submarine technologies. Psychological Deterrence: Its ability to potentially cause “radioactive tsunamis” along enemy coastlines adds a new dimension to nuclear deterrence, raising ethical and strategic debates globally. Global Implications Arms Control Concerns: Poseidon’s introduction complicates future nuclear arms treaties , as current frameworks (like New START ) do not account for autonomous underwater nuclear systems. Strategic Stability: It may trigger an underwater arms race , with the U.S., China, and NATO nations likely to accelerate counter-drone and detection technologies. Environmental Risks: The use of nuclear propulsion raises concerns about marine contamination in the event of malfunction or accident. India’s Relevance While India does not possess such a weapon, Poseidon’s test underscores the growing importance of autonomous naval systems and underwater deterrence in future warfare. It aligns with India’s own focus on AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles) and nuclear submarine capabilities for strategic balance in the Indo-Pacific. Conclusion Poseidon marks a transformative shift in underwater warfare — merging nuclear power, autonomy, and deterrence into a single platform. Its emergence signals a new era in strategic naval technology, challenging global arms control norms and redefining the contours of maritime security.",,,RAU IAS;Editorial Analysis;Current Affairs,https://compass.rauias.com/2025/11/03/
e2b5a8d6-f6ed-482b-9328-284ce3ba3106,2025,RAU IAS Editorial Analysis,6,"India’s Maritime Vision: Strengthening Sea Connectivity and Global Competitiveness. India’s maritime sector plays a pivotal role in its economic and strategic landscape. With 12 major ports and over 200 non-major ports along a 7,500 km coastline, the sector handles nearly 95% of India’s trade by volume and 70% by value. Recognizing this significance, the government has launched two landmark roadmaps — Maritime India Vision (MIV) 2030 and Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047 — aimed at transforming India into a global maritime power. Maritime India Vision (MIV) 2030 Launched in 2021, MIV 2030 is a comprehensive national strategy to position India among the world’s top 10 maritime nations by 2030. It outlines 150+ initiatives requiring investments of around ₹3–3.5 lakh crore across port modernization, coastal shipping, shipbuilding, and inland waterways. The vision is guided by six key principles: challenge analysis , innovation , time-bound implementation , global benchmarking , human capital development , and Waste-to-Wealth recycling of maritime scrap and resources. MIV 2030 builds upon existing initiatives such as Sagarmala , ensuring continuity in infrastructure, connectivity, and logistics reforms. The Maritime Development Fund (MDF) ensures long-term project financing, while the Financial Assistance Scheme encourages domestic shipbuilding. Digitization is being enhanced through platforms like the Sagarmanthan portal and the National Logistics Portal (Marine) . Key Focus Areas The policy framework identifies ten thematic areas including shipbuilding, port governance, cruise tourism, inland waterways, and maritime safety. Notably, 23 National Waterways have been prioritized to promote low-cost and eco-friendly cargo movement. Additionally, the National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal, Gujarat, aims to showcase India’s ancient maritime culture and trade networks. Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047 Launched in 2023 at the Global Maritime India Summit, this long-term roadmap seeks to make India a global maritime leader by 2047 , aligning with the centenary of independence. It proposes 300+ initiatives with investments of ~₹80 lakh crore . Key targets include: Increasing port capacity to 10,000 MTPA Positioning India among the top five shipbuilding nations Creating over 1.5 crore employment opportunities Building strong maritime skill and research clusters The strategy rests on four pillars: Port-led Development , Shipping & Shipbuilding , Seamless Logistics , and Maritime Skill Development . Growth Trends (2014–2025) Inland Waterway cargo grew from 18 MMT to 146 MMT (710% rise) Operational waterways increased from 3 to 29 Port capacity nearly doubled to 2,762 MMTPA Vessel turnaround time reduced from 93 hours to 48 hours Indian seafarers now form 12% of the global workforce Conclusion India’s maritime transformation is not only an economic strategy but also a strategic imperative.

Context: The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) will launch India’s first-ever National Household Income Survey (NHIS) in February 2026 . This landmark initiative aims to generate reliable, comprehensive, and regionally representative data on household income and its distribution across different socio-economic groups. About the National Household Income Survey (NHIS) Objective: The primary goal of the NHIS is to provide accurate income estimates and assess income inequality across rural and urban India. It will help policymakers design targeted welfare measures, strengthen fiscal planning, and evaluate the impact of government schemes on income distribution. Implementing Agency: The survey will be conducted by the National Statistics Office (NSO) under the MoSPI , marking a significant expansion of India’s official statistical architecture. Coverage and Scope: Both rural and urban households will be covered. Data collection will be carried out through digitally supervised household visits to ensure transparency and minimize human error. The survey will capture income from multiple dimensions, including: Wages and salaries Self-employment Property income Pensions and remittances Welfare and social transfers Methodology: A Technical Expert Group (TEG) , chaired by Surjit S. Bhalla , will design the methodology using global best practices . This will ensure consistency with international standards used in income and inequality studies by organizations such as the World Bank and OECD . Challenges in Conducting NHIS Sensitivity Barrier: Pre-tests conducted in 2025 revealed that 95% of respondents were unwilling to disclose income details, reflecting deep-seated privacy and trust concerns. Fragmented Sources: Rural households often have multiple informal income streams , making it difficult to verify and aggregate income accurately. Non-Monetised Output: The self-consumption of farm produce and barter-based exchanges complicate valuation of non-marketed income. Data Inconsistency: Persistent under-reporting and recall bias may result in lower reported income compared to actual consumption levels. Irregular Earnings: Seasonal labourers and self-employed workers face fluctuating earnings, leading to inconsistent and incomplete data capture . Significance Will fill a critical gap in India’s socio-economic data landscape, as previous surveys (like NSSO consumption surveys) only provided expenditure-based insights. Supports the measurement of income inequality (Gini coefficient) and helps track regional disparities . Enhances India’s capacity to align with SDG Goal 10 – Reduced Inequalities . Facilitates evidence-based policymaking for taxation, welfare targeting, and poverty alleviation . Key Economic Context India’s per capita Gross National Income (GNI) for 2024–25 stood at ₹2.31 lakh (current prices) , marking an 8.7% year-on-year increase . However, this growth masks regional and class-based disparities—making NHIS data crucial for accurate, equitable policy design. Conclusion The National Household Income Survey marks a transformative step towards improving India’s statistical precision and policy targeting. Despite implementation challenges, it promises to bridge the long-standing gap between income and consumption data , enabling a more inclusive understanding of India’s economic reality.",,,RAU IAS;Editorial Analysis;Current Affairs,https://compass.rauias.com/2025/11/03/

53dc2b66-0f0b-4a90-aaf7-9e1cb2a42c76,2025,RAU IAS Editorial Analysis,9,"Policy Framework on Relocation of Forest-Dwellers from Tiger Reserves. Context: The Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) has submitted a policy brief titled “Reconciling Conservation and Community Rights” to the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEFCC) . The brief proposes a structured Policy Framework for ensuring humane, rights-based relocation and coexistence of forest-dwelling communities within India’s Tiger Reserves . Background India’s tiger conservation success —with tiger numbers rising to over 3,000 (as per the 2022 census) —owes much to strong legal frameworks such as the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 (WLPA) and the Forest Rights Act, 2006 (FRA) . However, conflicts arise when conservation goals lead to forced or poorly managed relocations of indigenous and forest-dependent communities. The proposed framework seeks to balance ecological integrity with social justice , ensuring both tiger habitats and human rights are protected. Key Recommendations from the Policy Framework 1. National Governance and Oversight National Framework: Jointly developed by MoTA and MoEFCC to standardise relocation procedures , establish timelines, and ensure accountability. Public Database: A National Database on Conservation–Community Interface will track relocation cases, compensation details, and post-relocation outcomes. Independent Audits: Accredited agencies will conduct annual compliance audits under FRA 2006, WLPA 1972, and human rights norms. 2. Relocations as an Exceptional Measure Voluntary and Last Resort: Relocation must only occur with verified ecological necessity and community consent . Rights Verification: All Individual and Community Forest Rights (CFRs) must be recognised at the Gram Sabha level before relocation. Consent Safeguards: Implementation of Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) with oversight by civil society observers. 3. Co-existence as the Preferred Option Right to Remain: Communities can continue living inside traditional forest areas while exercising rights under FRA 2006. In-situ Development: Provision of essential services— healthcare, education, housing, and water —to make coexistence sustainable. Shared Governance: Gram Sabha members to be included in Tiger Conservation Foundations and Eco-Development Committees . 4. Legal Safeguards and Grievance Redressal Compliance Officer: Every tiger reserve must appoint one to monitor FRA and WLPA compliance. Grievance System: A three-tier redressal mechanism (district–state–national) will address rights violations or compensation disputes. Legal Recourse: The SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 will apply in cases of coercion, forced eviction, or denial of rights. Challenges in Relocating Forest Dwellers Livelihood Collapse: Forest-based economies are replaced by insecure, debt-prone livelihoods. Example: 2019 study on Sahariya Adivasis (Kuno NP, MP) – over 90% fell into debt post-relocation. Compensation Deficit: The ₹15 lakh NTCA package ignores provisions of the LARR Act, 2013 , which ensures higher and fairer compensation. FRA Coercion: Cases like Baiga communities of Achanakmar TR show relocation without granting Community Forest Rights . Health Decline: Post-relocation diets rely on PDS food , reducing nutrition diversity and increasing malnutrition (e.g., Kanha TR, MP ). Conflict Shifting: Moves from core to buffer zones increase human–wildlife conflicts , as seen in Tadoba-Andhari TR, Maharashtra . Way Forward A people-centric conservation model must integrate ecological sustainability with human dignity . The proposed framework emphasizes voluntariness, transparency, and shared governance , aligning conservation with constitutional principles of justice and inclusivity .",,,RAU IAS;Editorial Analysis;Current Affairs,https://compass.rauias.com/2025/11/04/

3a25f597-a761-4eb2-b5e5-ed9692d91611,2025,RAU IAS Editorial Analysis,11,"MoSPI’s New CPI Framework for Inclusive and Accurate Price Measurement. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is one of the most important indicators for measuring inflation, influencing monetary policy decisions, welfare schemes, and cost-of-living adjustments. Recently, the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) has proposed a significant revision in the methodology for calculating CPI, particularly in the housing component. The aim is to make the index more representative of real living conditions across both urban and rural India. Background Currently, housing has a weight of 21.67% in the urban CPI and 10.07% at the all-India level . However, this component is derived primarily from urban rental data and, in several cases, uses the House Rent Allowance (HRA) of government employees as a proxy for rent levels. Economists have pointed out that this approach fails to capture actual rental movements in growing smaller towns and does not account for rural housing dynamics, where ownership and imputed rent patterns differ significantly. Key Proposed Changes 1. Inclusion of Rural Housing Data For the first time, the CPI housing index will incorporate rental data from rural areas . This shift is based on the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) 2023–24 , which includes both actual rent paid and imputed rent for owner-occupied homes. This is important because rural India reports high home-ownership but also experiences value changes in housing that must be reflected in inflation estimates. 2. Exclusion of Employer-Provided Accommodation Rent data from government or employer-provided dwellings will no longer be used. In such cases, HRA depends on administrative pay scales rather than the market rental environment. Their inclusion was leading to distorted inflation signals , particularly in metropolitan centers. 3. Monthly Rent Data Collection The present methodology collects rental data only once in six months , leading to delayed or smoothed inflation readings. Under the revised framework, rent data will be collected monthly from all selected dwellings , improving the timeliness and sensitivity of the housing index. 4. Expanded Sampling and Global Best Practices The revised framework draws on technical guidance from IMF experts , emphasizing panel-based rent tracking to maintain month-to-month comparability. This will reduce volatility and ensure a more stable and representative inflation measure. Significance of the Reform Enhances accuracy and responsiveness of CPI to real housing market changes Improves representation of small towns and rural households Strengthens economic planning and monetary policy calibration Aligns India’s inflation measurement approach with global statistical standards Conclusion MoSPI’s revision to the CPI housing framework marks a major step toward inclusive and evidence-based inflation measurement . By reflecting actual housing costs across diverse regions, the new methodology is expected to improve policy outcomes, welfare targeting, and the credibility of India’s inflation statistics.",,,RAU IAS;Editorial Analysis;Current Affairs,https://compass.rauias.com/2025/11/04/

7b3c4a64-e2ed-4077-8bb6-40c27b50b3de,2025,RAU IAS Editorial Analysis,14,"Makhana: Bihar’s Superfood Economy and the Push for Value Addition. Context: Bihar, which produces nearly 90% of India’s makhana (foxnut), has recently become central to the government’s agricultural and rural development strategy. With rising global demand and growing recognition of makhana as a superfood , the crop holds unique economic and cultural significance, especially in the Mithilanchal region of Bihar. Economic Significance Makhana (botanical name: Euryale ferox ) is primarily cultivated in the districts of Darbhanga, Madhubani, Purnea, and Katihar , which together contribute around 80% of Bihar’s production. Traditionally consumed during fasting and Ayurvedic diets, makhana has now gained mainstream popularity due to its high protein, low fat, and antioxidant-rich profile. The global makhana market, valued at USD 43.56 million in 2023 , is projected to double to USD 100 million by 2033 , driven by rising health-consciousness and snack industry diversification. This positions makhana as a high-value export crop that can generate employment and entrepreneurship in rural Bihar. Challenges in the Sector Despite its potential, several structural issues limit farmer incomes and market development: Processing and Infrastructure Gaps: Bihar lacks sufficient food processing units (FPUs) , cold-chain facilities, and export-oriented packaging centres. Large quantities of raw makhana are sold to processors in Punjab and Assam , where value addition and branding occur — leaving Bihar farmers with a low share of final profits . Weak Market Organisation: Small farmers depend on middlemen due to a lack of producer cooperatives or direct market access. The demand for Minimum Support Price (MSP) remains unresolved, emerging as a critical farmer welfare concern. Labour-Intensive and Costly Cultivation: Harvesting involves manual pond diving , shelling, and hand-roasting, making the process both time-consuming and expensive. Low Productivity Levels: Traditional cultivation methods yield only 1.7–1.9 tonnes/hectare , whereas improved varieties such as Swarna Vaidehi and Sabour Makhana-1 can increase yields to 3–3.5 tonnes/hectare with scientific practices. Read also: Foxnuts (makhana) are in demand as a ‘super snack’ National Makhana Board On 15th September , the Prime Minister launched the National Makhana Board in Purnea, Bihar , with a budget of ₹100 crore .

Context : The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) is set to release updated black spot data for 2023–2024. This marks India’s first real-time mapping of accident-prone zones , leveraging the Electronic Detailed Accident Report (e-DAR) and Integrated Road Accident Database (iRAD) platforms. Previously, MoRTH’s Transport Research Wing (TRW) collected black spot data manually through state submissions and field verification. This process delayed policy response and left the national database outdated beyond 2022. About Black Spots A black spot is defined as a 500-metre stretch on a National Highway (NH) with a high frequency of accidents. A location qualifies as a black spot if, over a three-year period, it records: Five or more accidents involving deaths or grievous injuries, or Ten or more fatalities . Between 2016 and 2022 , India identified 13,795 black spots , of which 5,036 have already been rectified through long-term engineering interventions . New Approach: Data-Driven Road Safety The 2023–24 black spot list will be derived from real-time e-DAR and iRAD systems , ensuring faster identification and rectification.

a8820079-c2c6-4857-9c25-3255cffa1ff1,2025,RAU IAS Editorial Analysis,17,"India’s Technological Future: Towards Deeptech Sovereignty. Context : Union Minister Piyush Goyal recently emphasised that India must transition from digital adoption to technological creation — aiming for deeptech-led sovereignty and reducing reliance on foreign technologies. What is Technological Sovereignty? Technological Sovereignty refers to a nation’s ability to develop and deploy its own technologies using indigenous infrastructure , ensuring autonomy in data, innovation, and strategic capabilities — a cornerstone of national sovereignty in the digital age. India’s Dependence on Foreign Technology Electronics: Over 65% of chips and 80% of high-end components are imported ( MeitY, 2024 ). Defence: About 60% of defence equipment depends on foreign Original Equipment Manufacturers ( SIPRI, 2023 ). Renewables & EVs: 90% of solar wafers and 70% of lithium-ion cells come from China. Pharma Inputs: 68% of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) are still imported despite PLI efforts. Consequences of Technological Dependence Economic Drain: High import bills widen the current account deficit — electronics imports exceeded $70 billion in 2024 . Innovation Deficit: India holds less than 1% of global AI patents , reflecting limited indigenous innovation. Employment Loss: Deeptech manufacturing employs less than 2% of India’s tech workforce ( NASSCOM, 2023 ). Digital Sovereignty Risks: Over 75% of India’s cloud infrastructure is managed by foreign firms ( IDC, 2024 ), raising concerns over data autonomy and national security. The Way Forward 1. Deeptech Push Strengthen innovation in AI, quantum computing, space tech, and semiconductors . The ₹1 lakh crore Anusandhan Fund (2025) will accelerate deeptech R&D. 2. R&D Incentives Raise national R&D expenditure (currently <1% of GDP) and provide tax benefits to private research. Learn from Israel’s Innovation Authority , which co-funds up to 50% of R&D costs . 3. Chip Independence Expand the India Semiconductor Mission (2021) with $10 billion incentives for chip design, fabrication, and assembly units. 4. Building a Skilled Pipeline Develop high-end skills in STEM , retain researchers, and strengthen global scientific collaboration. Initiatives like the VAIBHAV Summit and SERB Overseas Fellowships connect diaspora scientists with Indian research institutions. 5.

Context (TH, 2025): With the paddy harvesting season underway in Punjab, stubble burning has re-emerged as a significant environmental and public health concern. Despite a visible decline in the number of recorded fire incidents, the total burnt area remains largely unchanged , reflecting the deep-rooted structural and economic issues behind the practice. Why Do Farmers Continue to Burn Stubble? Short Cropping Window: Farmers have only 20–25 days between paddy harvest (late October) and wheat sowing (mid-November). This limited time forces them to resort to burning for rapid field clearing. (Punjab Agricultural University, 2024) Labour Shortage: Mechanisation and rural migration have reduced the agricultural workforce by ~45% over the past decade. (NITI Aayog, 2023) High Machinery Cost: Machines like the Happy Seeder and Super Straw Management System (SMS) cost between ₹1.5–2 lakh, which remains unaffordable for smallholders even after 50–80% subsidy . Fragmented Landholdings: Small and fragmented farms (average size 1.9 ha in Punjab, 1.4 ha in Haryana ) make residue management uneconomical. (Agricultural Census, 2021) Weak Enforcement: While penalties are prescribed under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 , enforcement is lax due to socio-political sensitivities at the local level. Environmental and Health Impacts Stubble burning contributes up to 35–45% of Delhi-NCR’s winter PM2.5 levels . Releases CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O , aggravating climate change. Causes smog, respiratory illness, and soil nutrient depletion . Way Forward In-situ Management: Promote Happy Seeder and Super SMS through Custom Hiring Centres (CHCs) under ICAR’s Crop Residue Management Scheme . Ex-situ Utilisation: Divert paddy straw to biogas, paper, and biomass power plants . Under the SATAT Scheme , India aims to set up 5000 Compressed Biogas plants . Direct Incentives: Provide ₹2000–₹3000 per acre to farmers avoiding residue burning. Pilot programs in Sangrur and Patiala reduced fire incidents by 60% . Behavioural Change: Campaigns like “No Burn November” and school-based awareness drives are essential to shift community behaviour. Digital Monitoring: Integrate MODIS, VIIRS, and Sentinel-2 satellite data with on-ground verification for real-time fire mapping. (PGIMER Chandigarh, 2025) Conclusion: While policy interventions have made progress, long-term sustainability requires a blend of economic incentives, decentralised residue utilisation, and behavioural change , making stubble management a collective environmental responsibility.",,,RAU IAS;Editorial Analysis;Current Affairs,https://compass.rauias.com/2025/11/06/

Context : The United States has granted India a six-month sanctions waiver for the operation and development of Iran’s Chabahar Port , effective October 29, 2025 . This move allows India to continue strategic work at the port without facing penalties under U.S. sanctions laws. Background: U.S. Sanctions on Iran The sanctions originate from the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act (IFCA), Section 1244 , targeting entities engaged in Iran’s energy, shipping, shipbuilding, and port sectors . Violations could result in asset freezes, exclusion from the U.S. financial system , and business restrictions . The U.S. employs these sanctions to maintain “maximum economic pressure” on Iran—aiming to halt nuclear proliferation, curb Tehran’s support to regional militias, and push for a stricter nuclear accord. In 2018 , the U.S. granted India a waiver recognizing Chabahar’s role in Afghanistan’s post-war reconstruction and as a humanitarian trade hub . However, following the Taliban takeover in 2021 and shifting geopolitical priorities, the exemption was revoked in September 2025 —until this recent six-month reinstatement. Chabahar Port: India’s Strategic Gateway Located in Iran’s Sistan-Balochistan province , Chabahar sits on the Gulf of Oman , only 170 km west of Pakistan’s Gwadar Port (operated by China under CPEC). It is Iran’s only oceanic port and provides India direct access to Afghanistan, Central Asia, and Europe , bypassing Pakistan . Key Terminals: Shahid Kalantari Terminal: Developed in the 1980s for conventional cargo operations, reducing Iran’s dependence on the congested Strait of Hormuz. Shahid Beheshti Terminal: Operated by India Ports Global Limited (IPGL) , it forms the backbone of India’s connectivity projects—enabling cargo movement to Afghanistan and Central Asia via the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) . Strategic Importance for India Connectivity & Trade: Strengthens India’s trade links to Eurasia , offering a secure supply chain alternative amidst global disruptions. Regional Balancing: Counters China’s Gwadar influence and enhances India’s maritime and logistical presence in the region. Energy & Security: Serves as a logistical node for energy imports and humanitarian outreach to landlocked neighbors. Geopolitical Significance: Reflects India’s ability to maintain strategic autonomy while managing ties with both Washington and Tehran . Conclusion The temporary U.S. waiver reaffirms Chabahar’s role as a strategic lifeline for India’s regional outreach.

Civil War in Sudan Context: El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur in Sudan, witnessed a large-scale massacre after the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) seized control from the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) . The incident marks a grim escalation in Sudan’s ongoing civil war. Infographic Disclaimer: Map not to scale. Background: Sudan, located in Northeast Africa and bordered by the Red Sea, is the continent’s third-largest nation and the world’s leading producer of gum arabic. Since April 2023, the country has been engulfed in a brutal conflict between the SAF and the RSF — paramilitary forces that once fought together during the ouster of long-time ruler Omar al-Bashir in 2019. Nature of Conflict: Rivalry for Power: The war stems from a leadership struggle between SAF chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (“Hemedti”) over control of the state and military integration. Territorial Split: The RSF controls much of western and central Sudan, including Darfur and Kordofan, while the SAF holds the north and east, operating from Port Sudan. El Fasher Capture (Oct 2025): RSF’s capture of the North Darfur capital resulted in mass killings and ethnic cleansing, effectively partitioning Sudan. Proxy Involvement: Regional powers have turned the conflict into a proxy war — with the UAE reportedly backing the RSF, and Egypt and Iran supporting the SAF. Consequences: Humanitarian Crisis: Over 24 million Sudanese face acute food insecurity; famine conditions persist in Darfur and Kordofan. Mass Displacement: More than 14 million people have been displaced, creating the world’s largest internal displacement crisis. State Disintegration: The central government has collapsed, halting Sudan’s fragile post-2019 democratic transition. Regional Fallout: Refugee influxes and arms trafficking have destabilised neighbouring nations such as Chad, South Sudan, and Egypt. 2. Indian Household Debt Rising Faster than Assets Context: According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Indian households are accumulating debt faster than they are generating assets, as per comparative data between FY 2019–20 and FY 2024–25. Key Findings: Debt–Asset Gap: Financial liabilities have risen 102% since 2019–20, while asset creation has increased by only 48% . GDP Share: Household financial assets declined from 12% to 10.8% of GDP, while liabilities increased from 3.9% to 4.7% . Net Savings: India’s household savings have touched a five-decade low , reflecting growing reliance on debt-driven consumption. Portfolio Trends: Mutual Fund Investments: Increased from 2.6% to 13.1% of household portfolios. Currency Holdings: Declined from 11.7% to 5.9% , indicating digital and market-linked preference. Bank Deposits: Slightly increased to 33.3% of total assets. Implications: Rising financial stress due to increasing dependence on credit. Weakening long-term financial resilience and retirement preparedness. Broader macroeconomic concerns — reduced savings mean lower domestic investment capital and higher systemic credit risk. Way Forward: Sudan’s civil conflict underscores the fragility of post-revolution states and the danger of militarised governance. Simultaneously, India’s rising household debt highlights the need for stronger financial literacy, savings incentives, and responsible lending policies to sustain inclusive growth.",,,RAU IAS;Editorial Analysis;Current Affairs,https://compass.rauias.com/2025/11/07/

Context: In a historic global first, the Republic of Maldives has implemented a Generational Tobacco Ban , making it illegal for anyone born on or after January 1, 2007 , to buy or use tobacco products. This bold step places the island nation at the forefront of the global Tobacco Endgame movement , which seeks to eradicate tobacco use altogether rather than merely control it. Key Highlights of the Policy Comprehensive Ban: Applies to both citizens and tourists born in or after 2007, prohibiting all forms of tobacco use and sale. E-Cigarette Prohibition: Extends to a total ban on import, sale, possession, and use of e-cigarettes and vaping devices across all age groups. Legislative Foundation: Enacted under the Tobacco-Free Generation (TFG) framework, aligning national law with the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) . Global Significance: The Maldives’ approach echoes the “Tobacco Endgame” vision adopted by several progressive countries, including New Zealand, Finland, the UK, Canada, Australia, and Malaysia . Understanding the Tobacco Endgame Movement The Tobacco Endgame is a public health paradigm shift from merely reducing tobacco use to eliminating it. Goal: To reduce smoking prevalence to below 5% globally within a fixed timeframe. Core Strategies: Enforcing Tobacco-Free Generation laws. Limiting nicotine content in products. Implementing “ sinking-lid ” supply caps on tobacco sales. Increasing excise duties and restricting retail availability. Participation: Several countries have initiated phased Endgame policies; however, India has yet to formally adopt a national Endgame target despite being a signatory to WHO FCTC. About the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) The WHO FCTC is a landmark global treaty adopted in 2003 (effective from 2005 ), representing the first legally binding health agreement under WHO. Objective: To protect current and future generations from tobacco’s health, social, environmental, and economic harms. India’s Role: India ratified the FCTC in 2004 , committing to implement evidence-based tobacco control measures. Supplementary Protocol: The 2012 Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products strengthens global tracking systems to curb smuggling. Major Provisions under WHO FCTC Demand Reduction: Imposing higher taxes (Article 6), graphic health warnings (Article 11), and banning advertising (Article 13). Protection from Second-hand Smoke: Ensuring smoke-free workplaces and public transport (Article 8). Trade and Access Regulation: Preventing sales to minors and tackling illicit trade (Articles 15–16). Public Health Safeguards: Shielding health policies from tobacco industry interference (Article 5.3). Conclusion The Maldives’ Generational Tobacco Ban marks a turning point in global health governance, signalling the beginning of a post-tobacco era.

Global Norms: Brings India’s e-commerce labelling standards closer to international consumer protection practices. About the Legal Metrology Framework The Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011 , under the Legal Metrology Act, 2009 , regulate labelling, packaging, and disclosure norms for pre-packed goods. The rules mandate clear information on manufacturer details, quantity, price, and expiry. Dual MRP for the same product is prohibited. Enforcement lies with State Legal Metrology Departments and the Department of Consumer Affairs. Impact For Consumers: Greater clarity and ethical choice in online shopping. For Businesses: May increase compliance cost but enhances brand credibility. For Governance: Bridges regulatory gaps between traditional retail and digital platforms. For the Economy: Encourages domestic manufacturing and boosts consumer trust in “Made in India” products. Conclusion The move represents a forward-looking step in India’s evolving digital consumer protection regime. By mandating transparency at the point of purchase, the government ensures that consumers remain active participants in market fairness and sustainability.",,,RAU IAS;Editorial Analysis;Current Affairs,https://compass.rauias.com/2025/11/12/
3e943b12-d922-4803-b539-43d6b0a58f3a,2025,RAU IAS Editorial Analysis,32,"SC Affirms Arrest Must Be Communicated in a Language Understood by the Arrestee. Context : The Supreme Court of India has ruled that an arrest will be deemed illegal if the written grounds of arrest are not provided in a language understood by the person being arrested. This extends the earlier protection — which applied only to arrests under special laws like the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) — to all arrests , including those made under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) or the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) . Background and Constitutional Basis The judgment draws upon the fundamental rights enshrined in: Article 22(1): Requires that any person arrested must be informed “as soon as may be” of the grounds for arrest and has the right to consult a legal practitioner of their choice. Article 21: Protects life and personal liberty, implying that liberty cannot be curtailed except through a fair, just, and reasonable procedure established by law. The Court clarified that these provisions must be read together to ensure meaningful protection of the arrestee’s rights. Supreme Court’s Key Observations Right to Know: The person being arrested has a constitutional right to be informed of the specific reasons and charges against them. Language of Communication: Merely reading out the grounds or handing over documents in an unfamiliar language does not satisfy the constitutional mandate. Written Clarity: The grounds must be given in writing and in a language the person can read or comprehend , enabling them to seek legal counsel or apply for bail effectively. Procedural Fairness: Failure to comply renders the arrest illegal and liable to be struck down. Significance of the Ruling Uniform Safeguard: Extends protection to all types of arrests, ensuring parity between special and general laws. Empowerment of Citizens: Safeguards linguistic and educationally disadvantaged groups. Administrative Accountability: Compels police and investigating agencies to adhere to due process, reducing arbitrary arrests. Reinforcement of Rule of Law: Emphasises that liberty can only be curtailed through transparent and comprehensible procedure. Implications Police manuals and arrest procedures across states will require updating. Translations and local-language templates of arrest memos will need to be developed. Judicial scrutiny of arrest documentation is likely to increase, strengthening the procedural integrity of criminal justice. Conclusion This ruling deepens the meaning of “due process” under Articles 21 and 22, reaffirming that the right to liberty is not merely a legal formality but a substantive, communicative right. By ensuring that every citizen — regardless of language or literacy — understands the reason for their arrest, the Supreme Court has reinforced constitutional morality and inclusivity in the justice system.",,,RAU IAS;Editorial Analysis;Current Affairs,https://compass.rauias.com/2025/11/12/

Context : India’s policy focus is gradually shifting from ensuring food security to achieving nutritional security . This transition reflects the need to address chronic malnutrition, rising non-communicable diseases, and environmental pressures, through the promotion of functional foods and smart proteins . Functional Foods and Smart Proteins Functional Foods: Nutrient-enriched foods offering added health benefits, such as zinc-fortified rice (IIRR, Hyderabad) and iron pearl millet (ICRISAT). Smart Proteins: Alternative proteins produced via plant-based, fermentation-derived, or cultivated meat technologies. Start-ups like GoodDot and Blue Tribe Foods are pioneering plant-based products; Zydus LifeSciences has entered fermentation protein R&D. Why India Needs Nutritional Reform Persistent Malnutrition: 35.5% of children are stunted, 19% wasted (NFHS-5). Protein Deficit: Daily average intake (~47 g) below FAO’s 60 g norm. Urban–Rural Divide: Urban diets contain 25–30% more protein (NITI Aayog, 2023). Health Concerns: India has 77 million diabetics and 25 million obese adults (IDF 2023; WHO 2024). Environmental Challenge: Livestock contributes 18–20% of GHG emissions; smart proteins can reduce emissions by 90%. Economic Opportunity: Global alternative protein market may reach $240 billion by 2030. Challenges Regulatory Vacuum: No FSSAI standards yet for cultivated or fermentation-based foods. Public Perception: Only 28% Indians trust lab-made foods (NCAER 2024). Infrastructure Deficit: Fewer than 15 large fermentation plants in India (DBT 2024). Affordability: Functional foods cost 20–30% more. Skill Gap: Less than 10% of food-science graduates specialise in nutritional biotechnology. Way Forward National Nutrition Innovation Policy: Integrate DBT, FSSAI & MoHFW to regulate and promote functional foods, similar to Japan’s FOSHU model. FSSAI Framework: Define standards and safety testing for smart proteins. Public–Private Partnerships: Expand BIRAC and NITI Aayog incubators for R&D. Farmer Inclusion: Incentivise bio-fortified crops via MSP and procurement. Awareness & Education: Include nutrition literacy in school curricula. Skill Development: Establish nutritional biotechnology programs in agricultural universities.

a8e571d5-ea81-4308-a85d-dc2af3f8541b,2025,RAU IAS Editorial Analysis,38,"Soil Organic Carbon: The Foundation of Soil Health. Context : A recent ICAR study has found that climate change and unbalanced fertiliser use are accelerating the decline of Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) in India’s farmlands. SOC is vital for soil fertility, water retention, and carbon sequestration — making it central to both food security and climate resilience. Key Findings of the ICAR Study SOC levels increase with elevation and decline with temperature , explaining higher carbon retention in hilly regions compared to plains. Haryana, Punjab, and western Uttar Pradesh show the highest decline due to overuse of urea and phosphorus-based fertilisers. Low SOC is directly linked to micronutrient deficiency and declining crop yields. Understanding Soil Organic Carbon SOC is the carbon component of soil organic matter , accounting for 50–60% of its weight. Healthy soils contain 1–6% SOC , derived from decomposed plants, roots, and microbes. SOC is the key determinant of soil fertility , microbial activity , and moisture retention . Determinants of SOC Temperature: Cooler regions retain more carbon; warmer climates accelerate decomposition. Rainfall: Moderate rainfall aids vegetation growth; arid zones lose carbon through erosion. Soil Texture: Clay soils preserve carbon better than sandy soils. Vegetation Type: Grasslands and forests differ in carbon storage patterns. Topography: Slopes lose SOC due to erosion, while valleys accumulate it. Benefits of High SOC Improves soil structure and resistance to erosion . Enhances nutrient availability and microbial balance . Increases water retention and irrigation efficiency . Acts as a carbon sink , mitigating climate change. Reduces dependence on chemical fertilisers. Factors Reducing SOC Intensive tillage and residue burning. Overuse of chemical fertilisers. Deforestation and land-use change. Warming temperatures and soil erosion. Way Forward Promote organic manures, composting, and biochar . Encourage no-till and cover cropping practices. Introduce carbon farming incentives and carbon credit markets. Develop soil carbon monitoring systems under ICAR–NBSS&LUP. Integrate SOC management into National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) . Conclusion Soil Organic Carbon is the lifeline of Indian agriculture. Its conservation is not just an agronomic necessity but a climate imperative — essential for restoring soil vitality, ensuring food security, and achieving India’s carbon neutrality goals.",,,RAU IAS;Editorial Analysis;Current Affairs,https://compass.rauias.com/2025/11/15/
f87bad49-2a50-44de-a966-3062fa630929,2025,RAU IAS Editorial Analysis,39,"Nine Years After Demonetisation: Lessons and Realities. Context : Nine years after the 2016 demonetisation drive, police in Ghaziabad uncovered a fraud racket offering to exchange old ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes — indicating that a small underground market for demonetised currency persists. The episode revives debate on whether the policy achieved its intended economic outcomes. Background On 8 November 2016 , the Government of India announced demonetisation of ₹500 and ₹1,000 currency notes, which constituted 86% of total currency in circulation , citing objectives such as: Curbing black money and counterfeit currency Promoting digital payments Strengthening formalisation of the economy Key Data and Trends Currency with the Public: Fell sharply from ₹17.97 lakh crore (Nov 2016) to ₹7.8 lakh crore (Jan 2017). Current Level: ₹37.29 lakh crore (as of Oct 2025, RBI data) — more than double pre-demonetisation levels. Currency-to-GDP Ratio: Pre-demonetisation (2016–17): 8.7% Pandemic peak (2020–21): 14.5% 2025: 11.1% , still higher than the U.S. (7.9%) or China (9.5%). Digital Payments: UPI transactions grew at 49% CAGR (FY23–FY25), with monthly volumes exceeding ₹20 lakh crore. Analysis Mixed Success: While demonetisation catalysed digital payment adoption, cash usage remains deeply rooted, especially in the informal sector. Temporary Disruption: Short-term liquidity shocks impacted MSMEs, agriculture, and the unorganised sector. Informal Economy: About 80–85% of India’s employment is still informal and cash-dependent. Tax Base Expansion: Direct tax returns grew from 4.9 crore (2016–17) to 8.9 crore (2024–25), suggesting some formalisation effect. Counterfeit Currency: RBI data shows fake note detection decreased by 31% between 2016 and 2024. Structural Implications Digital Ecosystem: Strengthened through UPI, Aadhaar, and Jan Dhan accounts. Behavioural Change: Increased trust in digital finance, though cash continues as a safety asset. Monetary Stability: Currency-to-GDP ratio declining implies faster GDP growth vis-à-vis cash expansion. Future Challenge: Balancing inclusion with cash-independent growth. Conclusion Demonetisation’s legacy is complex — it accelerated India’s digital transformation but failed to permanently reduce cash dependency. The policy’s long-term impact lies less in cash withdrawal and more in shaping a hybrid economy combining cash resilience with digital innovation.",,,RAU IAS;Editorial Analysis;Current Affairs,https://compass.rauias.com/2025/11/15/

Context : A recent NITI Aayog report has raised significant concerns about the Government of India’s expanding use of Quality Control Orders (QCOs) across numerous sectors. While intended to enhance product quality, consumer safety, and manufacturing standards, the aggressive rollout of QCOs is generating unintended consequences for trade, industry productivity, and particularly MSMEs . QCOs are issued under the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) Act , making BIS certification mandatory for the manufacturing, import, or sale of specified products. Over the past four years, ministries have increasingly relied on QCOs for imports reduction, quality enhancement, and alignment with India’s manufacturing ambitions. However, NITI Aayog’s analysis shows that without adequate capacity, alignment with global norms, or domestic supply readiness, QCOs may create supply disruption , cost escalation , and loss of export competitiveness . What Are Quality Control Orders (QCOs)? QCOs are legally binding directives issued by ministries that require products or components to comply with BIS standards. Purpose of QCOs Protect consumer safety Improve product reliability Encourage manufacturing formalisation Reduce low-quality imports Ensure global consistency of Indian products QCOs have been introduced across sectors like steel, chemicals, electronics, textiles, toys, footwear, and food products. Key Findings of the NITI Aayog Report 1. Disproportionate Focus on Raw Materials Most QCOs target raw materials and intermediate goods , not finished products. This creates vulnerabilities because: Many intermediates are not manufactured domestically at required scale or quality Domestic firms rely on imported intermediates for global supply chains Domestic shortages lead to price spikes 2. Standards Not Aligned With Global Norms NITI Aayog found that several Indian standards differ significantly from: ISO norms ASTM international benchmarks EU or US industry regulations This non-alignment makes compliance costly, reduces interoperability, and limits India’s export competitiveness. 3. Testing Infrastructure is Inadequate India has limited BIS-accredited labs , causing: Long waiting periods Higher compliance costs Slower production cycles Delayed imports and manufacturing bottlenecks For SMEs dependent on just-in-time supply chains, such delays can be existential. Impact on Imports and Exports According to research by the Centre for Social and Economic Progress (CSEP) : Impact on Imports Imports fall by 13% in the first year of a QCO Long-term decline reaches ~24% The steepest decline is in intermediate goods like steel, yarn, fibres — up to 30% drop While this may seem beneficial for import substitution, shortages raise domestic prices and reduce industry competitiveness. Impact on Exports Exports initially rise 10.6% due to upgraded quality But drop sharply by 12.8% in the second year , due to: Higher input costs Delays in certification Misalignment with global standards Reduced flexibility for exporters Thus, long-term export gains remain limited. Impact on Downstream Industries Sectors experiencing the harshest impact: Footwear Electronics Apparel Auto components SMEs in textile clusters Why? Many intermediate components required by these industries are not produced domestically . QCO-induced shortages make raw materials costlier — polyester yarn, fibres, and certain steel grades now cost 15–30% above global prices . Higher input costs reduce: Price competitiveness Design flexibility Market access In labour-intensive sectors, this undermines employment generation. Impact on MSMEs MSMEs are the worst affected due to: Certification fees Repeated inspections Factory audits Small production lots Limited working capital QCO compliance typically costs ₹10,000–₹15,000 per consignment , with approval cycles stretching into months. Large firms can internalise such costs, but MSMEs operate on thin margins. Moreover, only SEZ exporters are exempt — domestic tariff-area MSMEs cannot bypass QCOs even for export-linked inputs. This significantly reduces MSMEs’ ability to compete both domestically and internationally. Governance and Policy Challenges Overlapping Regulations QCOs often overlap with: FSSAI norms Environmental safety rules PLI scheme conditions Customs standards Lack of Consultation Industry bodies argue that consultation periods for draft QCOs are short, and concerns are not fully incorporated. Non-tariff Barrier Accusations Major trading partners have raised concerns that India’s QCOs act as barriers to trade , risking retaliation. Way Forward 1. Prioritise Finished Goods Over Intermediates Target QCOs at finished goods where consumer safety matters most, not at intermediate products essential for manufacturing. 2. Expand Accredited Testing Capacity Establish more BIS-accredited laboratories in tier-2 and tier-3 clusters. Introduce concessio",,,RAU IAS;Editorial Analysis;Current Affairs,https://compass.rauias.com/2025/11/17/
d4b5b728-affa-47ff-874b-9bdb5dac0706,2025,RAU IAS Editorial Analysis,43,"China’s Rare Earth Export Restrictions. Context : In November 2025, China imposed export controls on seven rare earth elements (REEs) , citing national security, supply-chain protection, and non-proliferation concerns. This move has revived global anxieties about Beijing’s near-monopoly over the rare earth supply chain and triggered fresh debates on critical mineral security , strategic vulnerabilities, and the reshaping of global technological competition. China’s decision comes at a time when countries worldwide are accelerating transitions to clean energy , electric mobility , and advanced defence manufacturing , all of which depend heavily on REEs. The restrictions will significantly influence geopolitics, global markets, and India’s quest for supply chain resilience. Understanding Rare Earth Elements Rare earth elements comprise 17 metallic elements , including neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, terbium, and yttrium. Although not geologically rare, they are difficult to extract and refine, making supply chains complex and environmentally taxing. Key Uses Defence : Missile guidance systems, lasers, radar components, jet engines. Electronics : Smartphones, fibre optics, computer chips, displays. Clean Energy : Strong permanent magnets for wind turbines, solar inverters, EV batteries. Healthcare : MRI equipment and diagnostic devices. China’s Dominance According to USGS 2024 : China accounts for 70% of global mining 85–95% of global refining and processing capacity Controls most magnet manufacturing , the most value-added stage. China’s control over midstream and downstream processing creates a structural dependency that few countries have been able to bypass. India’s Position India has the fifth-largest REE reserves , mainly in coastal monazite sands in Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh. However, India contributes less than 2% of global rare earth output due to: Limited processing technology Environmental restrictions Low value-addition capability Monopoly of public sector mining agencies Impacts of China’s Export Restrictions 1. Global Supply Shock Markets reacted sharply: Dysprosium prices projected to reach $300/kg Neodymium magnet prices already up 12–18% in spot trading High-tech manufacturing firms triggered emergency procurement This resembles the 2010 episode when China cut exports to Japan, causing global prices to skyrocket. 2. Strategic Vulnerability for Defence and High-Tech Sectors REEs are central to military capabilities. The export curbs may: Disrupt Western missile and radar supply chains Delay F-35 production and similar aerospace programmes Create bottlenecks in EV and renewable energy expansion The US and EU have labelled the situation a national security challenge . 3. Acceleration of Global Diversification Efforts China’s move is accelerating rare earth diversification globally: Japan reduced its dependence on China from 90% (2010) to 60% (2023) through investments in Australian projects. United States revived domestic production under the Mineral Security Partnership (MSP) . Australia, Canada, and Vietnam are exploring joint refining and magnet-making clusters. 4. Implications for India India has joined global efforts to diversify critical minerals supply through: KABIL (Khanij Bidesh India Ltd.) , securing five lithium blocks in Argentina New rare earth exploration in Odisha and Kerala Potential refining tie-ups with Japan, Australia, and the US However, India must improve both processing capacity and regulatory efficiency to avoid remaining a raw material exporter. Way Forward for India 1. Global Collaboration India should deepen cooperation through: India–Australia Critical Minerals Alliance QUAD Rare Earth Working Group MSP-led international supply chain partnerships This offers access to refining technology, investment, and secure long-term supplies. 2. Sustainable and Responsible Mining India must adopt ESG-focused mining standards through the UNEP Global Mineral Governance Framework . Key reforms include: Transparent mining leases Stringent waste and radiation safety norms Rehabilitation plans for mined-out areas This will ensure community support and global investor confidence. 3. Recycling and Substitution Urban mining and recycling can meet a significant share of REE demand: Recovery from e-waste Substitution using ferrite magnets where feasible Incentives for recycling startups Japan recovers >50% of rare earth magnets from end-of-life electronics — a model India can replicate. 4. Strategic Stockpiling India requires a National Critical Minerals Reserve , similar to Japan’s JOGMEC model , which: Stockpiles critical minerals Invests in mining abroad Supports recycling industries This helps protect domestic industries during global supply shocks. Conclusion China’s rare earth export restrictions demonstrate how minerals have become tools of global geopolitics.

First Formal LPG Agreement This is the first structured contract between India and the US for LPG supply, forming nearly 10% of India’s annual LPG imports . 2. Shift in Price Benchmarking The pricing will use the Mont Belvieu benchmark instead of the traditional Saudi Aramco Contract Price (CP) . Mont Belvieu (Texas) is the world’s largest LPG storage and pricing hub, where daily spot prices reflect North American market dynamics. This shift reduces India’s dependence on Middle Eastern pricing mechanisms and allows greater price transparency . 3. Strategic Value Enhances energy security by diversifying supply sources beyond West Asia. Strengthens the India–US strategic partnership , complementing cooperation on critical minerals, LNG, technology, and defence. Provides a hedge against geopolitical disruptions in the Gulf region. India’s LPG Landscape 1. Global Ranking India is the second-largest LPG consumer worldwide (32 MMT annual demand), after China. 2. Sectoral Consumption Domestic kitchens: ~90% of demand Commercial & Industrial: Hotels, eateries, industries Automotive: Auto-LPG vehicles 3. Import Dependence India imports 60%+ of its LPG needs, mainly from: UAE Saudi Arabia Qatar Kuwait The US deal reduces over-reliance on West Asia. 4. PMUY – Social Impact The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) provides deposit-free LPG connections to low-income women and targeted subsidies for up to 9 refills annually , making LPG a central pillar of India’s clean energy transition. About Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Composition: Primarily propane (C₃H₈) and butane (C₄H₁₀) . State of Matter: Gas at normal temperature & pressure. Converts to liquid under moderate pressure or cooling → enabling efficient storage & transport. Volume Ratio: Liquid LPG occupies 1/250th of its gaseous volume. Safety: Naturally odourless; ethyl mercaptan is added for leak detection. Risk: LPG vapour is heavier than air and collects at low points, increasing explosion risk. Global Producers: Largest Producer: United States Other major producers: Saudi Arabia, China Top Exporters: United States & Qatar Conclusion India’s first-ever LPG deal with the US marks a major milestone in its energy diplomacy. By shifting to the Mont Belvieu benchmark and reducing dependence on West Asian suppliers, India strengthens its energy security, supply resilience, and geopolitical leverage , while deepening its strategic partnership with the United States.",,,RAU IAS;Editorial Analysis;Current Affairs,https://compass.rauias.com/2025/11/18/
24acbc12-10b6-4fb8-a682-ed15e0c3e015,2025,RAU IAS Editorial Analysis,46,"Chennai Port to Procure Green Tug under the Green Tug Transition Programme (GTTP). Context : The Chennai Port Authority has launched the procurement process for its first green tug under the Green Tug Transition Programme (GTTP) —a major national initiative to decarbonise India’s port operations. The move marks a significant step toward the adoption of cleaner, non-fossil-fuel propulsion systems in India’s maritime sector. What is a Green Tug? A tugboat is a compact, high-power vessel used to push or pull large ships for docking, undocking, and manoeuvring inside ports. A battery-electric tug (e-tug) achieves 100% elimination of nitrogen and carbon emissions. Hybrid green tugs can reduce emissions by 25%–35% , offering an intermediate transition option before full electrification. The Chennai Port’s proposed tug will use battery-electric propulsion , with built-in flexibility for future upgrades to methanol or green hydrogen systems. About the Green Tug Transition Programme (GTTP) The GTTP is an initiative of the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways (MoPSW) aimed at replacing diesel tugs with green, non-fossil-fuel propulsion systems . Key Features 1. Policy Alignment GTTP supports multiple national maritime and climate strategies: Panch Karma Sankalp Maritime India Vision (MIV) 2030 Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047 India’s Net-Zero Target (2070) 2. Nodal Agency The programme is led by the National Centre of Excellence in Green Port & Shipping (NCoEGPS) . 3. Technology Pathway Transition will occur in stages: Battery-electric tugs Hybrid diesel-electric tugs Methanol-based propulsion Green hydrogen fuel-cell systems 4. Implementation Roadmap Phase 1 (2024–2027): Four major ports must procure at least two green tugs each . Phase 2 (2027–2030): At least 50% of tug fleets in pilot ports must shift to green technology. Mandates: All new tugs after 2033 must comply with GTTP standards. All tugs at major ports must be 100% green by 2040 . Significance Supports the UN Sustainable Development Goal 14 (Life Below Water). Reduces maritime emissions and accelerates India’s shift toward green shipbuilding and eco-friendly port operations . Aligns with national decarbonisation goals: MIV 2030: 30% reduction in carbon emissions per tonne of cargo Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047: 70% reduction in carbon emissions per tonne of cargo The procurement of Chennai Port’s first green tug is therefore not a standalone development—it is part of a long-term structural transformation of India’s maritime infrastructure.",,,RAU IAS;Editorial Analysis;Current Affairs,https://compass.rauias.com/2025/11/18/

42c86cbb-54d7-4721-a65e-b5d38c7785fd,2025,RAU IAS Editorial Analysis,48,"Cooperative Kumbh 2025: Reimagining India’s Urban Cooperative Credit Landscape. Context : The Government of India recently hosted the Co-Op Kumbh 2025 , an international conference held in New Delhi to mark the United Nations’ International Year of Cooperatives (IYC) 2025 . Organised by the Ministry of Cooperation , the event focused on strengthening and modernising India’s Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) —a sector that plays a pivotal financial role in urban and semi-urban communities, yet has historically struggled with governance, technology adoption, capital adequacy, and regulatory compliance. The conference brought together policymakers, global cooperative leaders, financial regulators, and academic experts to discuss pathways for transforming UCBs into tech-enabled, transparent, and inclusive grassroots financial institutions. Significance of Cooperative Kumbh 2025 The Cooperative Kumbh is more than an event; it represents a renewed effort to revitalise India’s cooperative movement. UCBs serve millions of small borrowers, self-employed individuals, micro-businesses, street vendors, and low-income households. However, in recent decades, the sector’s growth has slowed due to governance challenges, dual oversight complexities, limited digital infrastructure, and inability to compete with commercial banks and fintech platforms. The 2025 conference aimed to reposition UCBs as strong community-based banking entities capable of serving India’s rapidly urbanising population. Key Outcomes: The Delhi Declaration 2025 The most significant achievement of the conference was the adoption of the Delhi Declaration 2025 , a strategic blueprint for the future of UCB reforms and expansion. The declaration highlights the need for improved governance standards, technology integration, stronger regulatory coordination, and enhanced financial inclusion through urban cooperatives. It acknowledges that while cooperatives are inherently community-centric, they require modern systems and professional management to remain viable in a competitive financial ecosystem. One of the most ambitious commitments in the declaration is the plan to establish at least one Urban Cooperative Bank in every Indian city with a population above two lakh within the next five years . This expansion intends to bridge financial access gaps in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, especially for informal workers and micro-enterprises who remain underserved by mainstream commercial banks. Digital Transformation: Sahkar Digi-Pay and Sahkar Digi-Loan A major highlight of the Cooperative Kumbh was the launch of two nationwide digital platforms— Sahkar Digi-Pay and Sahkar Digi-Loan . These platforms represent a transformative step in integrating UCBs into India’s rapidly expanding digital financial ecosystem by enabling online payment systems, digital lending, automated credit assessment, and real-time transaction tracking. The introduction of such systems also reduces operational risks, enhances transparency, and allows cooperative banks to compete with fintech innovations. Small UCBs, which lacked digital capacity due to financial or technical constraints, can now access centralised, government-supported digital infrastructure. Understanding Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) UCBs are financial institutions owned by members of a cooperative society. They operate primarily in urban and semi-urban areas and serve customers who often remain excluded from mainstream banks. Their legal foundation lies in the State Cooperative Societies Acts or the Multi-State Cooperative Societies Act , depending on their area of operation. Unlike commercial banks, UCBs are governed through a dual regulatory framework , making them unique within India’s financial system. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) oversees prudential norms, banking operations, capital adequacy, licensing, and risk management. The Registrar of Cooperative Societies (RCS) —under state or central government—oversees registration, elections, audits, and administrative matters. This dual structure provides UCBs with autonomy and flexibility but also contributes to operational delays, regulatory overlaps, and governance vulnerabilities. Relevance of the Cooperative Sector Today The cooperative movement has been central to India’s socio-economic development since the early 20th century. Today, with the emergence of digital finance, UCBs face both opportunities and challenges. They are well-positioned to serve the “missing middle” of India’s economy—micro and small entrepreneurs who are too big for microfinance but too small for commercial banks. However, to fulfil this role, they must undergo structural and technological transformation. The Cooperative Kumbh 2025 emphasises the need to professionalise UCB management through training, improved credit appraisal systems, better cyber-security practices, and adoption of global-level cooperative governance models.

f1825b8b-ff49-4d9d-8e7d-45c3189b2f0a,2025,RAU IAS Editorial Analysis,49,"Dumpsite Remediation Accelerator Programme (DRAP): India’s Push Toward Zero Dumpsites. Context : The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has launched the Dumpsite Remediation Accelerator Programme (DRAP) under the Swachh Bharat Mission–Urban 2.0 (SBM-U 2.0) . The programme aims to fast-track the remediation of legacy waste dumpsites , aligning with India’s vision of ‘Lakshya Zero Dumpsites’ and the broader national developmental agenda of Viksit Bharat 2047 . Legacy waste dumpsites represent one of the largest urban environmental and public-health challenges. They release methane, contaminate groundwater, attract disease vectors, and occupy scarce urban land. DRAP aims to address these issues systematically through scientific remediation, institutional strengthening, financing, and technological integration. Current Status of Dumpsite Remediation in India Scale of Legacy Waste According to MoHUA: India has 1,428 active legacy dumpsites Holding ~23 crore metric tonnes (MT) of waste 80% of this waste is concentrated in 214 high-impact dumpsites across 202 major Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) Progress Achieved So Far 1,048 dumpsites have already undergone remediation 14.33 crore MT of waste processed through biomining and bioremediation 7,580 acres of valuable urban land reclaimed — roughly 50% of the total remediable land India now ranks among the fastest countries globally in landfill reclamation scale Financial Support Centre offers ₹550 per tonne for legacy waste remediation ₹4,181 crore of Central Financial Assistance (CFA) sanctioned Total project cost: ₹10,228 crore across all states and UTs Additional support through the 15th Finance Commission grants for sanitation Objectives and Features of DRAP 1. Accelerated Remediation Model DRAP establishes a fast-track approach for: Biomining Bioremediation Scientific capping Real-time monitoring Its primary goal is to complete all legacy waste remediation by 2026 , ahead of urban population growth pressures. 2. Urban Land Reclamation and Reuse Reclaimed land will be repurposed for: Urban forests Green buffers Parks and public spaces Utility corridors Solar parks This reduces the need for fresh land acquisition. 3. Reduction of Urban Pollution Remediation aims to: Lower landfill methane emissions Prevent groundwater contamination through leachate Reduce fire hazards at dump sites Improve local air quality 4. Institutional Strengthening MoHUA has set up the SBM Knowledge Management Unit (KMU) at the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA) to: Build ULB capacities Standardise biomining protocols Facilitate peer-learning and best practices Develop training modules for municipal officials 5. Financing through Private Sector Participation HUDCO has launched the Urban Invest Window (UiWIN) to: Mobilise private investment Enable PPP-based remediation projects Support green infrastructure and circular economy initiatives Challenges in Dumpsite Remediation Despite progress, several bottlenecks remain: 1. Technical Capacity Gaps Only 30% of cities currently have functional waste treatment facilities (CPCB 2024). Many ULBs lack trained staff, biomining contractors, and scientific landfill management experience. 2. Funding and Project Cost Gaps Achieving 100% remediation requires investments much higher than available CFAs. States must mobilise their own capital and attract private players — often a challenge for smaller municipalities. 3. New Waste Accumulation 60% segregation at source (CPCB 2024) means unsegregated waste still reaches landfills daily. Without fresh waste diversion, legacy dumps could reappear. 4. Regulatory Compliance Only 68% of ULBs have notified by-laws under the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 Less than 45% have achieved complete source segregation This weakens enforcement and slows remediation. 5. Data and Monitoring Issues Only 35% of ULBs submit timely progress data Delays in dashboard reporting slow the release of CFA funds Weak digital tracking systems prevent accountability Way Forward 1. Integrated Waste Governance States should establish Urban Waste Management Cells to coordinate: Recycling policies Remediation work Waste-to-energy integration Maharashtra’s State Swachh Mission model is a good template. 2. Promote Circular Economy Models Leverage UiWIN to attract private investment in: Plastics recycling Bio-CNG plants Waste-to-energy Composting clusters Indore’s model of 100% landfill-free operations can be replicated. 3. Technology Integration MoHUA should create a National Digital Dashboard mapping: Dumpsite remediation progress Methane reduction estimates Land reuse potential Japan’s Smart Waste Portal can be a benchmark. 4. Scientific Land Reuse Reclaimed land must follow MoEFCC’s 2022 guidelines , enabling: Urban forests Solar energy installations Logistics parks Affordable housing 5.

6177ad5d-b1de-4766-864d-e14d89792cb2,2025,RAU IAS Editorial Analysis,51,"US Tariff Impact on India’s Export Economy. Context : The United States has imposed sharp tariff hikes on selected Indian products, triggering a decline in bilateral trade and amplifying short-term economic volatility. Beginning August 2025 , the US levied a 50% tariff on designated Indian goods, consisting of: 25% penalty tariff linked to India’s discounted purchases of Russian crude oil, and An additional 25% import duty across sensitive categories. This marks one of the most significant tariff escalations in recent India–US trade relations. Major Impacts of the Tariffs 1. Export Decline India’s outbound trade registered a sharp contraction: October exports ↓ 9% , following A deeper 12% fall in September , leading to A cumulative 11.8% decline in goods exports. 2. Record Trade Deficit India’s trade deficit widened to $41.68 billion in October , the highest on record , driven by: Higher imports of gold , Lower demand for Indian goods in the US market. 3. Bilateral Trade Surplus Shrinks India’s long-standing trade surplus with the US fell by 54% , reducing a key buffer in India’s external trade position. 4. Sectoral Stress Indian labour-intensive exporters faced steep price disadvantages compared to ASEAN and Chinese competitors. Engineering goods: ↓ ~16% Textiles & apparel: ↓ 8.34% Gems & jewellery: ↓ 25% 5. Resilient Sectors Despite overall contraction, two sectors showed robust performance: Electronics: Exports increased 25% , driven by smartphone and semiconductor-linked production. Pharmaceuticals: Continued stable double-digit growth due to strong US generics demand. Government Support Measures India has activated a combination of fiscal, credit, and regulatory interventions to stabilise exports: 1. Export Promotion Mission (EPM) The Cabinet approved a ₹25,060-crore scheme (FY 2025–30) to strengthen logistics, standards, branding, and global market access. 2. Credit Guarantee Scheme for Exporters (CGSE) A ₹20,000-crore scheme to provide collateral-free credit , easing financial strain on MSME exporters. 3. RBI Liquidity Relief The Reserve Bank of India announced a four-month moratorium on principal and interest payments for affected exporters, ensuring short-term liquidity. 4. QCO Rollback To reduce compliance costs and prevent supply bottlenecks, the government rolled back Quality Control Orders on key chemical intermediates. Conclusion The US tariff measures have caused immediate pressure on India’s export competitiveness and widened the trade deficit. However, India’s policy response—spanning credit support, export promotion, easing of compliance norms, and sector-specific interventions—aims to cushion the economy in the short run. Over the long term, India must diversify markets , enhance high-value manufacturing , and strengthen resilient supply chains to withstand global tariff shocks.",,,RAU IAS;Editorial Analysis;Current Affairs,https://compass.rauias.com/2025/11/19/

Context: The Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and BIRAC have placed Precision Biotherapeutics as a national priority under the BioE³ Policy (Bioeconomy for Emerging India Ecosystem) . This signals India’s commitment to building capabilities in personalised, gene-based, targeted and molecular therapies — the future of advanced medicine. What are Precision Biotherapeutics? Precision biotherapeutics are personalised, molecular-profile-based medical interventions designed using genomics, proteomics, bioinformatics, gene editing, RNA technologies, engineered cells, biologics, and AI-driven drug design. They represent a shift from the traditional, symptom-based approach to root-cause correction at the level of genes, cells, or molecular pathways. Key Technology Pillars Genomic–Proteomic Profiling Identifies patient-specific mutations, biomarkers, and disease signatures enabling personalised drug design. Gene & Cell Editing Technologies Includes CRISPR/Cas9 , CAR-T therapy , siRNA , and AAV (Adeno-Associated Virus) vectors for targeted or curative interventions. mRNA & Nucleic Acid Therapeutics Synthetic RNA can act as programmable instructions to produce missing or corrective proteins within cells. AI-Driven Drug Discovery Uses machine learning for molecular docking, target prediction, toxicity screening, and accelerated drug development. Significance of Precision Biotherapeutics for India 1. Targeted Cure Potential Unlike general drugs, precision therapies directly treat root-cause mutations . Example: CRISPR-based thalassemia therapy (Casgevy) approved by the US FDA and UK regulators in 2023. 2. Addressing India’s NCD Burden Nearly 65% of deaths in India are due to non-communicable diseases. Standard medicine often fails for complex cancers, rare diseases, cardiometabolic disorders; precision medicine provides accurate, personalised solutions. 3. India-Specific Genomic Needs India’s extreme genetic diversity means therapies developed abroad may not work optimally. Indigenous precision platforms are essential for “India-specific genotype therapies.” 4. Economic & Innovation Opportunity The global precision biotherapeutics market is projected to exceed USD 22 billion by 2027 , creating opportunities for biotech startups, IP creation, clinical trials, and high-value manufacturing. Challenges in India High Therapy Cost Global gene/cell therapies cost USD 0.5–2 million (e.g., Zolgensma: USD 2.1M), inaccessible to 99% of Indian households. Regulatory Gaps India still lacks a dedicated CDSCO approval pathway for gene, cell, RNA, and genome-edited products. Japan’s PMDA regenerative fast-track is a model India could emulate.

Context: The Supreme Court of India has struck down multiple provisions of the Tribunals Reforms Act, 2021 , citing violation of judicial independence, separation of powers, and past constitutional rulings. The Court observed that Parliament had repeatedly re-enacted provisions already invalidated in earlier Madras Bar Association (MBA) judgments, amounting to a legislative override of judicial decisions . Why the SC Struck Down the Provisions 1. Re-enactment of Previously Invalidated Clauses The Court held that the Central Government had introduced nearly identical provisions that had already been struck down in the MBA (2020 & 2021) cases, which amounted to colourable legislation . 2. Executive Dominance Over Appointments Since the government is frequently a litigant before tribunals, allowing it control over: tenure, age limits, service conditions, and the final choice of members undermines natural justice and the independence of adjudication . 3. National Tribunal Commission (NTC) The Supreme Court directed the Centre to establish the National Tribunal Commission (NTC) within four months to ensure: independent appointments, uniform administration, transparent service rules, and reduced executive interference. Struck-Down Provisions of the 2021 Act 1. Four-Year Tenure The Act fixed a four-year term for chairpersons and members. SC held it unconstitutional because it increases dependence on the executive for reappointment and violates prior directions mandating at least a five-year term . 2. Minimum Age of 50 Years The Court struck this down for being discriminatory and blocking younger, competent advocates from entering tribunal service. 3. Panel of Two Names The Act required the Search-cum-Selection Committee (SCSC) to recommend two names per vacancy, allowing the executive to choose one . SC held this violates the principle of judicial primacy . 4. Parity with Civil Servants Aligning service conditions with civil servants diluted the judicial character of tribunals and increased executive control. Issues Identified by the Court Short Tenure → Executive Dependence Arbitrary Age Restriction → Talent Barrier Two-Name Panel → Executive Dominance Civil Service Parity → Loss of Tribunal Autonomy About the Tribunals Reforms Act, 2021 The Act aimed to streamline tribunals by: Abolishing several appellate tribunals, Transferring functions to High Courts, Standardising appointments and service conditions, Empowering the Central Government to frame rules, Creating the SCSC for selection. However, the Act repeatedly clashed with constitutional safeguards identified in MBA rulings.

Context (TH): The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a cold wave warning for several districts in Telangana , highlighting an unusual southward spread of cold-wave conditions. Telangana is also the only South Indian state included in IMD’s core cold-wave zone . What is a Cold Wave? A cold wave refers to an abrupt and significant drop in temperature below the normal climatological average of a region during winter. Role of IMD The India Meteorological Department monitors winter temperatures and issues colour-coded warnings (Green, Yellow, Orange, Red). IMD uses minimum temperature thresholds and deviations from the long-term average to classify cold-wave intensity. Climatological Baseline Normal winter temperature values are based on IMD’s 1981–2010 climatology dataset . Criteria for Declaring Cold Wave 1. Plains Cold wave declared when: Minimum temp ≤ 4°C , or Minimum temp ≤ 10°C and 4.5°C–6.4°C below normal 2. Hilly Regions Minimum temp ≤ 0°C , and 4.5°C–6.4°C below normal 3. Coastal Regions Minimum temp ≤ 15°C and ≥4.5°C below normal Severe Cold Wave Declared when: Minimum temp ≤ 2°C , or Temperature is ≥6.5°C below normal Why Do Cold Waves Occur in India? 1. Western Disturbances The passage of Western Disturbances brings cold, dry north-westerly winds from the Himalayas and Central Asia. 2. High-Pressure Systems The Siberian High intensifies and pushes cold continental air masses toward India. 3. Himalayan Snowfall More snowfall → stronger cold air advection into the northern plains. 4. Clear Skies Absence of clouds = strong nighttime radiative cooling , causing sharp temperature drops. 5. Dense Fog Fog blocks daytime solar radiation, worsening cold conditions. 6. La Niña Events IMD observations show La Niña years bring longer and more intense cold waves. 7. Continental Climate Interior regions far from the sea lack maritime moderation, making them more vulnerable. Consequences of Cold Waves 1. Health Risks Hypothermia Frostbite Asthma & COPD exacerbation Cardiovascular stress due to vasoconstriction India records ~824 annual deaths due to cold exposure. 2. Agricultural Losses Frost damage to crops Reduced livestock productivity Stress on horticultural crops during flowering/fruiting 3. Infrastructure & Transport Fog-induced delays in rail, road, and air transport Power demand surges → outages Water pipelines may freeze in northern hill states About the India Meteorological Department (IMD) Established in 1875 , IMD is India’s National Meteorological Service . Functions under the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) . One of six Regional Specialized Meteorological Centres (RSMCs) under WMO. Provides: Meteorological observations Weather forecasts Disaster warnings for weather-sensitive sectors Conclusion Cold waves are a recurring winter hazard in India, driven by large-scale atmospheric circulation, local geography, and global climate patterns. With rising climatic variability, timely IMD alerts, climate-resilient agriculture, and public health preparedness have become essential for reducing cold-wave impacts.",,,RAU IAS;Editorial Analysis;Current Affairs,https://compass.rauias.com/2025/11/21/

a7a6a3ee-a705-416c-88f4-ee4ea9984a2f,2025,RAU IAS Editorial Analysis,62,"SC Clarification on Governor’s Powers to Assent Bills. Context: A five-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court delivered an important advisory opinion on the President’s Reference concerning the Governor’s powers to grant assent to Bills . The reference followed an earlier judgment where the Court held that prolonged inaction by Governors on State Bills is unconstitutional , and invoked Article 142 to declare those Bills as having received “deemed assent” . The latest advisory settles key constitutional questions relating to Articles 200 , 201 , 142 , 143 , and 361 . 1. Scope of Article 200: Governor’s Options The Supreme Court clarified that Article 200 provides only three choices when a Bill is presented to the Governor: Grant Assent Withhold Assent and Return the Bill (except Money Bills) Reserve the Bill for the President No Indefinite Delay The Constitution does not allow the Governor to sit indefinitely on a Bill. Any delay without reason is unconstitutional . Ministerial Advice The Governor is not bound by ministerial advice while choosing among these three constitutional options—because Article 200 expressly gives the discretion. 2. Limits of Judicial Review The Bench clarified the extent to which courts can intervene: Permitted Judicial Review Courts can examine prolonged, unexplained inaction by the Governor. They can issue a limited mandamus directing a decision. Not Permitted Courts cannot review the merits of the Governor’s decision to assent or withhold assent. Courts cannot impose deadlines because Article 200 uses the phrase “as soon as possible.” Courts cannot review the President’s decision under Article 201. Article 361 immunity does not protect the Governor’s office from questions of legality of inaction. 3. Judicial Role in the Assent Process Bills vs Laws Judicial review applies only to laws , not pending Bills . Courts cannot rule on the validity of a Bill before assent . No “Deemed Assent” The Court held that it cannot use Article 142 to deem assent where the Constitution requires explicit assent by the Governor or the President. President’s Discretion (Article 201) The President’s satisfaction is subjective . The President need not seek Supreme Court advice under Article 143 for every Bill. 4. Constitutional Timelines Though the Court cannot impose rigid deadlines, it stated: The phrase “as soon as possible” implies a constitutional urgency . The Governor and President must act within a reasonable timeframe consistent with democratic functioning. Relevant Constitutional Articles Article 200 – Governor’s powers regarding assent, return, or reservation of Bills. Article 201 – Presidential decision on reserved Bills. Article 361 – Personal immunity of Governor/President. Article 142 – Supreme Court’s powers to ensure complete justice. Article 143 – Presidential reference to the Supreme Court. Conclusion The Supreme Court’s clarification strengthens constitutional federalism by reaffirming that Governors cannot block the legislative process through inaction. By limiting judicial intervention yet reinforcing constitutional responsibilities, the judgment ensures transparency, accountability, and cooperative federalism within India’s democratic framework.",,,RAU IAS;Editorial Analysis;Current Affairs,https://compass.rauias.com/2025/11/24/
6c7b3bdf-4f78-4801-a365-7cfdbb8ec0e4,2025,RAU IAS Editorial Analysis,63,"Retrospective Environmental Clearances: Supreme Court Recall and Its Implications. Context : On 18 November 2025 , a 2:1 majority of the Supreme Court recalled its May 2025 Vanashakti judgment , which had prohibited the granting of ex-post-facto environmental clearances (ECs) . The recall reopens the legal pathway for granting environmental approvals after a project has already begun construction or operation , subject to conditions. What Was the Vanashakti Judgment (May 2025)? The Supreme Court’s earlier ruling had taken a strict environmental protection stance. It held that: Retrospective ECs are “gross illegality” and fundamentally opposed to environmental rule of law. The 2017 Notification and 2021 Office Memorandum , which allowed post-facto approvals, were struck down . It emphasised that regularising illegal construction weakens the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and contradicts the precautionary principle . Grounds for Recalling the Judgment (Nov 2025) The majority reconsidered the ruling for three key reasons: 1. Legal Consistency The Court noted that earlier Supreme Court cases — Pahwa Plastics Pvt Ltd (2022) D. Swamy vs KSPCB (2021) — had allowed post-facto ECs in exceptional circumstances . To avoid contradiction, the Court recalled the Vanashakti judgment for a fresh, larger review. 2. Economic Impact The May ruling risked demolition or shutdown of projects valued at ~₹20,000 crore , including pending expansions and partially completed facilities. 3. Public Interest Essential public infrastructure — Hospitals , Medical colleges , Airports — would face severe delays, affecting public welfare and regional development. Justice Bhuyan’s Dissent: A Strong Environmental Stand Justice Bhuyan disagreed with the recall, arguing: 1. Earlier permissive rulings were per incuriam He held that Pahwa Plastics and D. Swamy ignored binding precedents such as: Common Cause (2017) Alembic Pharmaceuticals (2020) Both emphasised that prior EC is mandatory and violations cannot be lightly condoned. 2. Precautionary Principle is non-negotiable He stressed that post-facto ECs defeat the core purpose of environmental regulation — preventing harm before it occurs rather than legalising it after destruction is done. Environmental Clearance Framework in India Environmental clearances operate under the EIA Notification, 2006 , issued under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 . Key Features Mandatory prior EC for 39+ categories (mining, infrastructure, industry, power, river valley). Category A projects → appraised by MoEFCC (Central). Category B → appraised by SEIAA (State). Expert Appraisal Committees (EAC/SEAC) conduct technical scrutiny. Public hearing mandatory for Category A & B1, except defence/strategic and small-scale projects. Validity: Mining (30 yrs), River valley (10 yrs), Industry/Infrastructure (7 yrs). Conclusion The Supreme Court’s recall highlights a fundamental tension between environmental protection and economic-development imperatives . The upcoming review will determine whether India’s environmental governance framework prioritises the precautionary principle or accommodates post-facto approvals for broader public and economic considerations.",,,RAU IAS;Editorial Analysis;Current Affairs,https://compass.rauias.com/2025/11/24/

Context : The Indian Justice Report (IJR) , an initiative of Tata Trusts , has released a new study titled “Juvenile Justice and Children in Conflict with the Law: A Study of Capacity at the Frontlines.” The report evaluates the functioning of Juvenile Justice Boards (JJBs) and allied institutions under the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 , highlighting systemic gaps in capacity, data, and oversight. Key Findings of the Indian Justice Report 1. High Pendency of Cases As of October 2023 , 55% of 100,904 cases before JJBs were pending. Average pendency: 154 cases per JJB Odisha had the highest pendency ( 83% ) Karnataka reported the lowest ( 35% ) This backlog undermines the Act’s requirement that inquiries be completed within four months . 2. Bench Shortages & Facility Gaps 25% of JJBs function without the mandatory three-member bench (Magistrate + 2 social workers). 30% of JJBs lack an attached Legal Services Clinic , blocking access to free legal aid. 14 states have not set up the statutory “Place of Safety” for 16–18-year-olds involved in heinous offences. 3. Poor Standards Compliance Only 11 of 292 districts met all seven minimum standards required under the JJ framework. There are just 40 girls-only child-care homes across India, highlighting gendered neglect. 4. Data and Transparency Gaps Unlike the adult criminal justice system which uses the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) , juvenile justice lacks a centralised public data repository , impeding planning and monitoring. 5. Weak Oversight Only 40% of mandated inspections of Child Care Institutions (CCIs) were completed, despite recurring concerns over abuse, overcrowding, and untrained staff. 6. Coordination Deficit The report shows poor coordination among the four nodal agencies: Police Department of Women & Child Development State Child Protection Society (SCPS) State Legal Services Authority (SLSA) This fragmentation weakens rehabilitation, monitoring, and timely justice delivery. About Juvenile Justice Boards (JJBs) Legal Basis: Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 Purpose: Reformative, child-centric adjudication—not punitive justice Composition: Chairperson: Metropolitan/Judicial Magistrate Two social workers (at least one woman) Functions: Inquiry into alleged offences Assessment of circumstances Formulation of rehabilitation and care plans Ensuring the child is produced within 24 hours About the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 The Act aligns India’s juvenile framework with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) . Key Features: Categories of offences: Petty (≤3 years), Serious (3–7 years), Heinous (≥7 years) Adult Trial Provision: Children aged 16–18 may be tried as adults for heinous offences after a preliminary assessment by the JJB. Institutional Setup: Separate JJBs and Child Welfare Committees (CWCs) in every district. Conclusion The IJR highlights deep structural and institutional weaknesses in India’s juvenile justice architecture. While the JJ Act, 2015 provides a progressive, child-centric legal framework, persistent shortages in manpower, infrastructure, data systems, and inter-agency coordination undermine effective implementation. Strengthening JJB capacity and creating a transparent, accountable ecosystem is essential to safeguard the rights and rehabilitation of children in conflict with the law.",,,RAU IAS;Editorial Analysis;Current Affairs,https://compass.rauias.com/2025/11/25/
73d93ffe-b3a7-4960-bff2-0ec4f51c5ba9,2025,RAU IAS Editorial Analysis,66,"CE20 Cryogenic Engine: ISRO Tests Bootstrap Mode Start. Context: ISRO has successfully demonstrated the bootstrap mode start on the CE20 cryogenic engine , which powers the upper stage of the Launch Vehicle Mark-3 (LVM3) . This marks a major technological milestone, proving that the engine can restart autonomously in space without external start-up systems , enabling multi-orbit missions with no payload penalties. What is Bootstrap Mode? Bootstrap mode is a method where a rocket engine initiates its own start-up sequence using its internal fuel flow and system pressure, without relying on external gas bottles, pyrotechnic starters, or auxiliary devices . This leads to lighter, simpler, and restartable cryogenic engines—crucial for missions requiring multiple injections such as GTO → GEO , constellation deployments , and deep-space manoeuvres . Significance of the Test Enables in-orbit restarts , a capability essential for advanced mission profiles. Improves LVM3’s competitiveness for multi-burn commercial missions .

0b32298d-8cc6-4f93-a47c-88c12002554f,2025,RAU IAS Editorial Analysis,69,"SARAL SIMS Portal: Simplifying India’s Steel Import Compliance. Context: The Ministry of Steel has launched the SARAL Steel Import Monitoring System (SIMS) portal to streamline and simplify registration requirements for small-volume and export-linked steel imports. The system replaces repetitive filings with a single annual registration, reducing compliance costs for MSMEs and export-oriented units. What is the SARAL SIMS Portal? The SARAL SIMS portal is a simplified digital registration mechanism under the existing Steel Import Monitoring System (SIMS). It aims to ease procedural requirements for importers dealing with low-volume steel consignments and imports linked to export obligations . Purpose Reduce the compliance burden on small importers Streamline registration for export-linked imports Ensure accurate national-level monitoring of steel import flows Key Features of the SARAL SIMS System 1. Single Annual Registration Importers must declare only their total intended annual import quantity . They receive one SARAL SIMS number , which can be used for multiple consignments throughout the financial year. This removes the earlier requirement of registering each shipment separately. 2. Small-Import Category Consignments up to ≤10 MT Annual cap: 1,000 MT Temporary cap: 500 MT until April 2026 This category is designed to support MSMEs, small traders, and artisans who import small quantities of specialised steel. 3. Export-Linked Category No quantity limits apply to imports made under: Advance Authorisation Special Economic Zones (SEZs) Export Oriented Units (EOUs) This facilitates smooth sourcing of raw materials for export production. Advance Authorisation Allows duty-free import of raw materials used to manufacture goods meant for export. SEZs Duty-free enclaves treated as foreign territory for trade and customs purposes. EOUs Units dedicated almost entirely to exports, permitted to import raw materials and machinery duty-free. 4. Validity and Compliance The SARAL SIMS number remains valid until 30 April of the following fiscal year . Importers must file a mandatory Annual Return by 30 April detailing actual import quantities. If actual imports exceed 1,000 MT , the importer must shift to the regular SIMS system for the rest of the year. Reversion to SARAL SIMS is not allowed within that financial year. Significance of the Portal 1. Reduces Compliance Burden Small importers are freed from repetitive documentation and multiple SIMS filings. 2. Supports Export Competitiveness SEZs, EOUs, and Advance Authorisation holders gain smoother access to steel inputs. 3. Enhances Transparency Annual declarations allow the government to track national steel import patterns more accurately. 4. Aligns with Digital Governance Goals Supports ease of doing business under the Government of India’s trade and industry facilitation policies. Conclusion The SARAL SIMS portal marks an important reform in India’s steel import monitoring framework. By simplifying processes for small and export-linked importers, the Ministry of Steel aims to strengthen industrial competitiveness, enhance compliance efficiency, and ensure better monitoring of steel inflows in line with national economic priorities.",,,RAU IAS;Editorial Analysis;Current Affairs,https://compass.rauias.com/2025/11/26/

f45d8698-f993-474b-875f-b519e3df15e1,2025,RAU IAS Editorial Analysis,72,"Western Ghats Classified as a Natural Site of “Significant Concern”. Context : The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) , in its 2025 World Heritage Outlook , has classified the Western Ghats as a natural World Heritage Site of “significant concern” due to increasing ecological pressures, fragmented governance, and climate-induced vulnerabilities. About the Western Ghats The Western Ghats , stretching for 1,600 km parallel to India’s western coast, are among the world’s oldest and most biologically diverse mountain systems. They span six states — Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu . Global Importance Recognised as one of 36 global biodiversity hotspots . One of India’s four biodiversity hotspots . Inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site (WHS) in 2012 for its exceptional ecological value. Biodiversity Features The region supports extraordinary species diversity and endemism , hosting many rare and threatened species such as: Nilgiri Tahr Lion-tailed Macaque Tiger Asian Elephant It also contains unique ecosystems like shola forests , montane grasslands, and high-altitude swamps. Major Threats Highlighted by the IUCN Outlook 2025 1. Climate Change Increasing temperatures, altered monsoon cycles, and frequent extreme events (landslides, floods, droughts) are forcing sensitive species to migrate into shrinking habitats. 2. Landscape Fragmentation Linear infrastructure — highways, railways, power corridors, and dams — breaks ecological connectivity and obstructs wildlife movement, increasing human-wildlife conflicts. 3. Monoculture Plantations Large-scale conversion of native forests into tea, coffee, rubber, and areca plantations reduces biodiversity, weakens soil health, and diminishes natural resilience. 4. Invasive Species Aggressive non-native trees such as acacia and eucalyptus outcompete indigenous flora, alter nutrient cycles, and disrupt natural ecosystem regeneration. 5. Tourism and Pilgrimage Pressure Unregulated tourism increases waste generation, air and noise pollution, and disturbs fragile wildlife zones, especially in high-altitude sanctuaries. 6. Governance Gaps Although the Ghats contain 39 protected areas across six states, jurisdictional overlaps complicate integrated management, leaving corridors poorly protected. Government Initiatives to Protect the Western Ghats 1. Statutory Protection Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 These govern diversion of forest land and protect wildlife habitats. 2. Protected Area Network The region includes: 2 biosphere reserves (Nilgiri, Agasthyamalai) 13 national parks (e.g., Silent Valley, Periyar ) Several wildlife sanctuaries 3. UNESCO World Heritage Obligations The 2012 WHS recognition requires state-specific conservation and management plans . 4. ESA Proposals Based on the Gadgil Committee (2011) and Kasturirangan Committee (2013) , the government has proposed Ecologically Sensitive Areas (ESA) to regulate mining, quarrying, construction, and thermal projects. 5. CAMPA Funding Kerala and Tamil Nadu are using CAMPA resources for shola–grassland restoration , fire-line creation, and invasive species management. Conclusion The Western Ghats face increasing ecological and governance pressures. The IUCN’s “significant concern” classification signals the urgency for coordinated conservation , improved regulation, landscape-level planning, and community-based stewardship to safeguard one of India’s richest ecological treasures.",,,RAU IAS;Editorial Analysis;Current Affairs,https://compass.rauias.com/2025/11/27/

06a65cef-dc64-4f6c-9bd2-3c56dbef156b,2025,RAU IAS Editorial Analysis,75,"Royalty Rationalisation for Critical Minerals. Context : The Union Cabinet has approved revised ad valorem royalty rates for four critical minerals — graphite, caesium, rubidium, and zirconium — with the aim of strengthening domestic mining, improving auction success, and reducing India’s dependence on imports for clean-energy supply chains. The reform aligns with India’s broader strategy to secure critical mineral value chains essential for EVs, semiconductors, batteries, renewable energy technologies, and defence manufacturing. Revised Royalty Rates Caesium: 2% of Average Sale Price (ASP) on metal content in ore Rubidium: 2% of ASP on metal content in ore Zirconium: 1% of ASP on metal content in ore Graphite: 80% fixed carbon → 2% of ASP <80% fixed carbon → 4% of ASP The shift from fixed-rate royalty to ad valorem ensures flexibility with market fluctuations, improving the viability of low-grade mineral extraction. Why India Needed Royalty Reform 1. High Import Dependence India is 100% import-dependent for lithium, cobalt, nickel, and rare earth elements (REEs). It imports 60% of graphite , a key component of anodes used in EV batteries. 2. Low Auction Success Rates Since 2023, only 34 out of 81 critical mineral blocks (42%) found bidders — high royalty rates and pricing ambiguity made projects commercially unattractive. 3. Surging Green-Tech Demand EV battery requirements are projected to rise 5–6 times by 2030 , significantly increasing demand for graphite, zirconium, and REEs. 4. Unviable Mining under Old Rates Fixed per-tonne royalties hurt miners during global price declines, making low-grade extraction unprofitable. 5. China-Dominated Supply Chains China processes ~90% of the world’s REEs . Its export controls have demonstrated the vulnerability of global clean-tech supply chains. Structural Bottlenecks in India’s Critical Mineral Ecosystem Weak Exploration Capacity: <0.9% of global mineral exploration spending; far lower than Australia (~13%) or Canada (~15%). Limited Processing Capability: India processes <2% of global REEs; refined copper output is just 3% globally. High Capital & Tech Gaps: Private exploration contributes <10% of India’s total spend (vs >60% in mature mining economies). Skilled Manpower Shortage: <20 geologists per million population (Australia: 140+). Fragmented Policy Environment: Regulatory delays and unclear pricing deter bidders. Way Forward Boost Exploration: Strengthen the National Mineral Exploration Trust (NMET); emulate Australia’s drilling reimbursement model. Domestic Processing: Introduce a PLI-style scheme for refining and processing critical minerals, similar to China’s refining clusters. Fast-Track Clearances: Create a unified portal integrating environment, forest, and concession approvals (Canada’s “one-window” model). Tech & Skills Partnerships: Collaborate with US, Australia, and Japan for mineral processing technologies and workforce training. Strategic Stockpiles: Establish reserves of lithium, cobalt, and REEs, similar to Japan’s JOGMEC model, to cushion supply disruptions. About Royalty Definition: Statutory payment made by miners to the government (the sovereign owner of mineral resources). Purpose: Ensures states receive fair value while enabling responsible extraction. Legal Basis: Governed by the Second Schedule of the MMDR Act, 1957 . Types of Royalty: Unit-based (per tonne) Ad valorem (% of sale value) – preferred for critical minerals Profit-based (share of net earnings)",,,RAU IAS;Editorial Analysis;Current Affairs,https://compass.rauias.com/2025/11/28/

aac40d10-f5c6-4da8-bdb6-19c4de7bbaa4,2025,RAU IAS Editorial Analysis,77,"Digital Sequence Information (DSI) and the Global Debate. Digital Sequence Information (DSI) has emerged as one of the most contentious negotiation points at the 11th Governing Body Meeting of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) being held in Lima, Peru . As countries push for equitable use of genetic resources, DSI has created new challenges beyond traditional Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) systems. What is Digital Sequence Information (DSI)? DSI refers to the digital representation of genetic material derived from biological resources. It includes: Nucleic acid sequences (DNA/RNA) Protein structures Metabolic profiles Epigenetic markers Annotated biological datasets These datasets are stored in major open-access global repositories such as GenBank (USA) , EMBL-EBI (UK) and the DNA Data Bank of Japan , collectively operating under the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) . INSDC ensures unified standards and free availability of global nucleotide-sequence data. DSI allows scientists to analyse genetic information without needing physical samples , thereby accelerating research, supporting synthetic biology, and enabling rapid diagnostics development. Benefits of DSI Accelerated Research: It removes dependence on time-consuming physical sample collection and permits fast computational analysis. Rapid Data Sharing: Open-access platforms facilitate quick development of vaccines, diagnostics, and precision treatments. Lower Barriers to Research: No transport permits or biosafety logistics are required for digital data, reducing cost and administrative hurdles. Targeted Therapies: Big-data analysis of sequences enables identification of disease-specific markers for highly precise interventions. Challenges and Concerns Despite its advantages, DSI has triggered serious global concerns: Unfair Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS): Companies can commercialise products using genetic data from biodiverse nations without sharing benefits, as DSI falls outside the CBD and Nagoya Protocol’s ABS mechanisms. Regulatory Uncertainty: There is no universally accepted legal definition of DSI, making policy harmonisation difficult. Traceability Issues: Tracking the origin of a genetic sequence or its commercial pathway is extremely complex. Capacity Gap: Developing countries lack sequencing infrastructure, skilled bioinformaticians, and data-processing capability, limiting their participation. To address ABS gaps, CBD COP16 (2024) in Colombia created the ‘Cali Fund’ , aimed at ensuring fair and equitable benefit-sharing arising from the commercial use of DSI. ITPGRFA and India's Position The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) , adopted in 2001 and in force since 2004, focuses on conserving and providing access to plant genetic resources essential for food and agriculture. It currently has 155 contracting parties (154 countries + EU). India’s Membership India ratified the treaty in 2002 through the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers’ Rights (PPV&FR) Act, 2001 and the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 . Multilateral System (MLS) The treaty establishes the MLS, offering rule-based access to 64 Annex-I crops crucial for global food security. Access is governed through Standard Material Transfer Agreements (SMTA) , which prohibit claiming intellectual property rights over MLS material. As DSI becomes central to genetic research, global negotiations aim to balance open science with fairness to biodiversity-rich nations.",,,RAU IAS;Editorial Analysis;Current Affairs,https://compass.rauias.com/2025/11/29/

cb5d4b18-5239-4d3c-a287-b5053f3849a8,2025,RAU IAS Editorial Analysis,79,"India’s Rising LPG Consumption: Drivers, Trends and Policy Implications. Context : India’s Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) consumption has surged to 31.3 million metric tonnes (MMT) in FY25 , driven by expanded household access under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) and growing commercial and industrial demand. With usage expected to reach 33–34 MMT in FY26 , LPG continues to dominate India’s clean cooking energy transition. About LPG LPG is a compressed mixture of propane and butane (≈40:60) used for: Cooking (household sector) Industrial applications Food services and transport It burns cleaner than biomass, kerosene, and coal, significantly reducing indoor air pollution. Trends in India’s LPG Sector 1. Strong Growth in National Consumption FY17: 21.6 MMT FY25: 31.3 MMT FY26 (projected): 33–34 MMT This represents one of the fastest-growing clean fuel transitions globally. 2. PMUY’s Transformational Impact Under PMUY, household LPG coverage expanded across rural and low-income homes. Average refill consumption increased from 3.9 cylinders/year to 4.5 cylinders/year . Improved affordability, last-mile delivery expansion and behavioural shift strengthened LPG dependence. The scheme dramatically reduced household smoke exposure and supported women’s health and safety. 3. Rising Commercial and Industrial Use Commercial and industrial consumers increased their share of total LPG demand: Earlier: ~10% FY25: ~16% Growth is driven by: Food service chains Institutional kitchens MSME clusters shifting away from solid fuels 4. Persistent Supply Gap and Import Dependence Domestic LPG production increased modestly: FY17: 11.2 MMT FY25: 12.8 MMT But imports rose sharply to ~20.7 MMT , keeping dependence at 55–60% . India is currently the world’s second-largest LPG importer after China. 5. Import Diversification for Energy Security Middle East supplies dominate India’s imports ( 91–93% ). The new India–US LPG agreement (2.2 MTPA) diversifies sourcing, reduces geopolitical exposure, and strengthens long-term energy security. About Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) A flagship central sector scheme by the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas , launched in 2016 , providing deposit-free LPG connections to women in low-income households. Eligibility Groups BPL households SC/ST families Antyodaya beneficiaries Forest dwellers SECC-listed households Migrants Women in island territories Note: Households without an adult woman are ineligible. Achievements 10.33 crore LPG connections provided 238+ crore refills in 9 years PMUY has significantly enhanced women’s health, reduced drudgery, and accelerated India’s adoption of clean cooking fuels. Conclusion India’s rising LPG consumption reflects both social welfare gains from PMUY and economic expansion . However, persistent import dependence underscores the need for domestic production enhancement, diversification of suppliers, and a long-term transition toward cleaner alternatives like bio-LPG , ethanol-based fuels , and green hydrogen derivatives .",,,RAU IAS;Editorial Analysis;Current Affairs,https://compass.rauias.com/2025/11/29/
