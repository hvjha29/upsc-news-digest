5,2025,The Hindu,5,"Camillo Golgi and Santiago Ramón y Cajal: Nobel Prize-winning pioneers who described the nervous systemPremium Though divided by fierce scientific rivalry — Golgi defending the idea of a continuous nerve network, Cajal championing the “neuron doctrine”, their discoveries together reshaped biology. Golgi’s revolutionary staining method revealed the hidden architecture of nerve cells, while Cajal’s interpretations proved that the nervous system was made of individual units: neurons. Their Nobel Prize marked not only a clash of ideas but the birth of modern neuroscience, and its impact extends to global health, neurology, psychiatry and public policy even today. Camillo Golgi was born on July 7, 1843, in Corteno, Italy. From modest beginnings, he studied medicine at the University of Pavia and began his career as a physician in psychiatric and hospital wards. With limited resources, he improvised laboratory space in his own kitchen. Out of these unassuming beginnings came one of the most transformative methods in biology: the silver chromate stain (a chemical reaction used to create a brick-red or brown-black color to make certain things, especially cells, visible under a microscope). Santiago Ramón y Cajal, born on May 1, 1852, in Petilla de Aragón, Spain, was raised under the stern discipline of his physician father. A gifted illustrator who once dreamed of becoming an artist, he redirected his talents toward science. His eye for detail and artistic hand later gave rise to some of the most iconic images in the history of medicine: the first clear drawings of neurons. In 1873, Golgi developed thereazione nera— the “black reaction.” The method impregnated a small fraction of nerve cells with silver chromate, revealing their entire shape under the microscope: cell body, dendrites, and axon. For the first time, the nervous system was visible not as a blur but as a forest of branching, living structures. A human neocortical pyramidal neuron stained via Golgi technique.

6,2025,The Hindu,6,"Robert Koch’s Nobel Prize: winning discoveries on tuberculosis and the foundations of bacteriologyPremium In 1905, German physician and microbiologist Robert Koch was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine “for his investigations and discoveries in relation to tuberculosis.” At a time when TB claimed millions of lives, Koch’s identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis as the causative agent transformed medical science and confirmed that the disease was infectious, not hereditary. The discovery not only guided prevention and treatment but also shaped public health strategies worldwide. Robert Koch was born on December 11, 1843, in Clausthal, a mining town in the Harz Mountains of Germany. A precocious child, he taught himself to read by age five and later studied medicine at the University of Göttingen, where pathologist Jacob Henle, an early proponent of germ theory left a lasting influence. After graduating in 1866, Koch worked as a country doctor and briefly served as a military physician during the Franco-Prussian War. Without access to formal laboratory facilities, he built his own microscopes and equipment, devising simple but effective methods that foreshadowed his breakthroughs in microbiology. Koch’s first great success came in 1876, when he identified Bacillus anthracis as the cause of anthrax. He introduced new methods to culture bacteria in pure form using gelatin and later agar, and developed staining techniques to make microbes visible under the microscope. From these experiments, he formulated Koch’s postulates, four criteria to establish a causal link between a microorganism and a disease. These postulates provided microbiology with its first rigorous framework, which continues to influence infectious disease research today, though adapted for viruses and molecular methods. Koch’s most celebrated discovery came in 1882. In a landmark lecture to the Berlin Physiological Society, he announced that he had identified the tubercle bacillus (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) as the cause of tuberculosis. By applying his staining techniques, he demonstrat",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/robert-kochs-nobel-prize-winning-discoveries-on-tuberculosis-and-the-foundations-of-bacteriology/article70037275.ece
7,2025,The Hindu,7,"Data supports current U.S. policy of hepatitis B vaccine for newborns, as officials push for change An independent review released on Tuesday by vaccine experts of more than 400 studies and reports found that long-standing U.S. policy of giving the hepatitis B vaccine to newborns has cut infections in children by more than 95%. The policy, adopted in 1991, will be discussed and voted on later this week by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine advisers hand-picked by U.S. health secretary and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ""After extensive review, we did not discover safety or effectiveness data that support delaying the choice parents have to vaccinate their newborns against hepatitis B,"" said Michael Osterholm, an infectious-disease expert at the University of Minnesota who helped found the Vaccine Integrity Project that released the review. The Vaccine Integrity Project is an initiative dedicated to safeguarding vaccine use in the United States set up to counter controversial vaccine information and recommendations from the Trump administration that are lacking or contrary to scientific evidence. The revamped CDC advisory panel, following Kennedy's firing of all 17 previous expert members, in September decided to postpone a vote to delay the birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine.’ Since then, U.S. President Donald Trump and other health officials have called for delaying the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine until as late as age 12, saying that the virus is largely sexually transmitted. Osterholm said the evidence clearly supports keeping the current U.S. policy. Hepatitis B is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis B virus. It primarily spreads through blood, semen, or certain other body fluids. Infants infected with hepatitis B during their first year of life have a 90% chance of developing a chronic infection, increasing the risk of serious liver disease such as cirrhosis or cancer. In a 2024 study reviewed by the Vaccine Integrity Project, the CDC had analysed data on children born between 1994 and 2023 and found that offering the ",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/data-supports-current-us-policy-of-hepatitis-b-vaccine-for-newborns-as-officials-push-for-change/article70352955.ece

17,2025,The Hindu,17,"Urbanisation, migration contribute to voter roll irregularities: Law Minister Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal said on Thursday (December 4, 2025) that rapid urbanisation and frequent migration were the likely causes of irregularities in the voter roll. Mr. Meghwal was responding to Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut, who asked if the government had taken cognisance of allegations of large-scale voter roll irregularities, including duplicate, deleted and fake entries reported in states like Karnataka, Maharashtra and Bihar. The MP also asked about steps being taken by the Election Commission (EC) to verify, update, and audit electoral rolls to ensure accuracy and prevent manipulation before the upcoming elections. Details were also sought about the verification mechanism to enhance transparency in the voter list revision process and measures being implemented to ensure electoral integrity, data security and accountability of officials involved in voter roll management and election preparedness. In a written reply, Mr. Meghwal said, that according to the EC, significant changes have occurred in the electoral roll over the last 20 years due to additions and deletions on a large scale. “Rapid urbanisation and frequent migration to pursue education, livelihood, and for other reasons, are now a given. Some electors obtain registration in one place and then shift their residence and register themselves at another place without getting their names deleted from the electoral roll of the initial place of residence. This has led to an increased possibility of repeated entries in the electoral roll,” the Minister said. He added that this warranted an intensive verification drive to verify each person before enrolment as an elector. Therefore, the Commission had ordered Special Summary Revision starting from Bihar, which has now been extended to other states. Mr. Meghwal said political parties are being involved in the process, and the electoral roll has been shared at the draft publication and final publication stage. The EC is also inviting claims, and objec",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/urbanisation-migration-contribute-to-voter-roll-irregularities-law-minister/article70357825.ece
19,2025,The Hindu,19,"Karnataka to develop ‘Digital Heritage Portal’ to preserve cultural legacy Karnataka is advancing its vision to become a national leader in digital heritage preservation with a proposal to create a unified Karnataka Digital Heritage Portal that will integrate manuscripts, rare printed works, archival records and other cultural resources on a single platform. The initiative, led jointly by the Oriental Research Institute (ORI), Mysuru, and the Karnataka State Archives, aligns with the Union government’s Digital India Mission and the National Mission for Manuscripts. Officials said the portal will provide global access to the State’s cultural heritage and strengthen long-term conservation and research. As a key component of the plan, ORI Mysuru is set to house the National Centre for the History of Indian Sciences, further strengthening its role as a premier knowledge repository. The Institute has already embarked on an ambitious programme to digitise its entire collection of palm leaf and paper manuscripts, while also establishing a dedicated website to make rare resources accessible to scholars worldwide. To accelerate digitisation, ORI has entered into an MoU with the Mahabharata Pratishthana, Bengaluru, and is also partnering with the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA), New Delhi. The Institute is upgrading its technology infrastructure to support AI-enabled tools for script recognition, metadata tagging, and digital restoration of damaged materials - an area where initial experiments have shown promising results, officials pointed out. A short audio-visual presentation has already been produced to demonstrate ongoing work and showcase the transformative potential of the digital heritage initiative. Training programmes for digital archivists and expanded digitisation capacity are also part of the broader roadmap. The ORI, Mysuru houses more than 70,000 manuscripts and 45,000 rare printed works, including the Arthashastra, Aryabhatiya, Natya Shastra and Sritattvanidhi.
