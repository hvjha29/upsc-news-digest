However, there are a few pockets in certain states where the naxalite problem still persists, mainly due to involvement of foreign countries. In that case, to control the situation Rohit might have to resort firing which may lead to valuable loss of lives of civilians and would further complicate the situation. With the multi-pronged strategy of the Central and State Governments especially in the last few years, the naxalite problem has been resolved to a large extent in the affected states of the country. 9. Rohit, who himself was leading one of the contingents, got a message through his intelligence source that about ten hard core naxalites were hiding in a particular village with sophisticated weapons. Rohit tried to contact his superior officer, IG (Special Operations) of the state on the radio set and on mobile phone, but failed to do so due to poor connectivity.

Over a period of time, Rohit has established an excellent intelligence network to get the real time information regarding the movement of naxalite cadres. Without wasting any time, Rohit reached the target village with his team and laid out a foolproof cordon and started carrying out a systematic search.

Rohit was in great dilemma since out of the naxalites apprehended two were not only hard core top insurgents with prize money of ten lakhs on their heads, but were also involved in a recent ambush on the security forces. Rohit is posted as SP (Special Operations) for the last one year, in one of the districts which is still affected by the naxalite problem. However, in the meantime, more than five hundred tribal women surrounded the village and started marching towards the target house, as they are their protectors and saviours. The situation on the ground was becoming very critical as the tribal women were extremely agitated and aggressive.

Rajesh Kumar realized that diversion of funds from the NHS could raise difficult questions for the government in the Parliament.

While the construction is heading towards completion, the Junior Engineers have been regularly reporting that all construction is taking place as per design specifications. However, in one of your surprise inspections, you have noticed some serious deviations and lacunae which, in your opinion, are likely to affect the safety of the flyover.

There is a lot of public pressure on the Corporation to get this construction completed because of heavy traffic congestion in the area. When you brought this matter to the notice of the Chief Engineer, he advised you that in his opinion it is not a very serious lapse and may be ignored.

The local economy is largely dependent on the firecrackers industry. It has led to tangible economic development and improved standard of living in the area. So far as child labour norms for hazardous industries like firecrackers industry are concerned, International Labour Organization (ILO) has set the minimum age as 18 years. In India however this age is 14 years. The units in industrial clusters of firecrackers can be classified into registered and non-registered entities. One typical unit is household-based work. Though the law is clear on the use of child labour employment norms in registered/non-registered units, it does not include household-based works. Household-based work means children working under the supervision of their parents/relatives. To evade child labour norms, several units project themselves as household-based works but employ children from outside. Needless to say that employing children saves the costs for these units leading to higher profits to the owners. On your visit to one of the units at Sivakasi the owner takes you around the unit which has about 10-15 children below 14 years of age. The owner tells you that in his household-based unit, the children are all his relatives. You notice that several children smirk, when the owner tells you this.

The head of the office was a senior officer conversant with the functioning of the office. He joined a new office along with five other colleagues. Due to harassment and humiliation suffered by him in the office, comfort and happiness virtually vanished from life. As a part of routine transfer, he was posted to another department. Pawan has been working as an officer in the State Government for the last ten years. Eventually, it badly affected his personal and family life. His wife who was always supportive to him also became a victim of his negativity and hostile behavior. Pawan realized his relationship with his senior officer was becoming more toxic and due to this, he felt perpetually tense, anxious and stressed. Whatever suggestions given or views expressed by Pawan in the meetings were summarily rejected and the senior officer would express displeasure in the presence of others. It became a pattern of boss’ style of functioning to show him in a bad light highlighting his shortcomings and humiliating publicly. It became apparent that though there were no serious work-related problems/shortcomings, the senior officer was always on one pretext or the other and would scold and shout at him. Initially, all seemed to go well. Thus, it damaged his physical and mental health. However, after some time Pawan felt that the officer was belittling him and at times unreasonable. The family environment was no longer pleasant and congenial. He was no longer joyous, happy and content even at home. The continuous harassment and public criticism of Pawan resulted in loss of confidence, self-esteem and equanimity. (a) What are the options available with Pawan to cope with the situation? (b) What approach Pawan should adopt for bringing peace, tranquility and congenial environment in the office and home? (c) As an outsider, what are your suggestions for both boss and subordinate to overcome this situation and for improving the work performance, mental and emotional hygiene?

He raises the following points:- (i)In the present times, when an unethical environment is quite prevalent, individual attempts to stick to ethical principles may cause a lot of problems in one’s career. It may cause hardship to the family members as well as risk to one’s life. Why should we not be pragmatic and follow the path of least resistance, and be happy with doing whatever good we can? (ii) When so many people are adopting wrong means and are grossly harming the system, what difference would it make if only a small minority tries to be ethical? They are going to be rather ineffective and are bound to get frustrated. (iii) If we become fussy about ethical considerations, will it not hamper the economic progress of our country? After all, in the present age of high competition we cannot afford to be left behind in the race of development (iv) It is understandable that we should not get involved in grossly unethical practices, but giving and accepting small gratifications and doing small favors increases everybody’s motivation.

Although there is already a commitment and goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2030, the challenge of lowering emissions seems overwhelming as the integration of AI continues to increase. (a) What is your immediate response to the challenges posed in the above case. The fast technological improvements have raised worries among environmental activists, regulatory authorities, and the general public over the sustainability of this scenario. What logical and ethical arguments will you put forth to convince about its necessity. You are the Chief Executive Officer and the majority shareholder of this company. In 2023, your organisation had a significant increase of 48% in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the levels recorded in 2019. The significant rise energy consumption is mainly due to the surging energy requirements of your data centres, fuelled by the exponential expansion of Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI models, especially those used extensive machine learning and data processing, exhibit much greater energy consumption than conventional computer tasks, with an exponential increase. 7. The difficulty is exacerbated by the competitive environment of the technology sector, where rapid innovation is essential for preserving market standing and shareholders’ worth. (b) Discuss the ethical issues involved in the above case. To achieve this goal, substantial investments in renewable energy use would be necessary. AI-powered services need much more computational resources and electrical energy compared to conventional online activities, notwithstanding their notable gains. (d) Being a conscience being, what measures would you adopt to maintain balance between AI innovation and environmental footprint?. The technology’s proliferation has led to a growing concern over the environmental repercussions, resulting an increase in warnings. (c) Your company has been identified to be penalised by technological giants.

A visit is scheduled during which he will visit the site along with the chief engineer and the senior architect. He wants you to check out all the papers relating to it and ensure that the visit is properly arranged. You examine the file which relates to the period before you joined the department. The land was acquired for the local panchayat at a nominal cost and the papers showed that clearance certificates are available for the two of the three authorities who have to certify the site’s suitability. There is no certification by the architect available on file. You decide to visit Rampur to ensure that all is in the order as stated on file. When you visit Rampur, you find that the plot under reference is a part of Thakurgarh fort and that the walls, ramparts, etc., are running across it. The fort is well away from the main village, therefore a school here will be a serious inconvenience for the children. However, the area near the village has potential to expand into a larger residential area. The development charges on the existing plot, at the fort, will be very high and the question of heritage site has not been addressed.

Shortly thereafter you found that there is considerable tension in the rural areas of your district on the issue of sending girls to schools. The elders of the village feel that many problems have come up because girls are being educated and they are stepping out of the safe environment of the household. They are of the view that the girls should be quickly married off with minimum education. The girls are also competing for jobs after education, which have traditionally remained in boys’ exclusive domain, adding to unemployment amongst male population. The younger generation feels that in the present era, girls should have equal opportunities for education and employment, and other means of livelihood. The entire locality is divided between sexes in both generations. You come to know that in Panchayat or in other local bodies or even in busy crosswords, the issue is being acrimoniously debated. One day you are informed that an unpleasant incident has taken place. Some girls were molested, when they were en route to schools. The incident led to clashes between several groups and a law and order problem has arisen. The elders after heated discussion have taken a joint decision not to allow girls to go to school and to socially boycott all such families, which do not follow their dictate.

Many states rejected its proposal due to the detrimental effect on the environment. But one state government acceded to the request and permitted the unit close to a city, brushing aside all opposition. The unit was set up 10 years ago and was in full swing till recently. The pollution caused by the industrial effluents was affecting the land, water and crops in the area. It was also causing serious health problems to human beings and animals. This gave rise to a series of agitations demanding the closure of the plant. In a recent agitation thousands of people took part, creating a law and order problem necessitating stern police action. Following the public outcry, the State government ordered the closure of the factory. The closure of the factory resulted in the unemployment of not only those workers who were engaged in the factory but also those who were working in the ancillary units. It also very badly affected those industries which depended on the chemicals manufactured by it.

However, you were further advised by the top management that if you do not clear the consignment, the company will not hesitate to terminate your services citing certain innocuous reasons. However, after a lot of persuasion and a series of competitive tests including written and interview, you managed to get a job in a leading shoe company. The top management ordered that ibid consignment to be cleared for the domestic market. The company has been doing good business for the last five years in the domestic market and this year it is even decided to export to Europe and Gulf countries. You again brought the knowledge of the Team Commander that such if cleared even for the domestic market, will tarnish the image and reputation of the company and will be counter-productive in the long run. You have done MBA from a reputed institution three years back but could not get campus placement due to COVID-19 generated recession. (c) What option would you adopt and why? (d) What are the ethical dilemmas being faced by you? (e) What can be the consequences of overlooking the observations raised by the inspecting Team?.

Rohit was in great dilemma since out of the naxalites apprehended two were not only hard core top insurgents with prize money of ten lakhs on their heads, but were also involved in a recent ambush on the security forces. However, if he did not release the naxalites, the situation could get out of control since the tribal women were aggressively charging towards them. 9. Rohit, who himself was leading one of the contingents, got a message through his intelligence source that about ten hard core naxalites were hiding in a particular village with sophisticated weapons. The district administration has taken a lot of developmental works in the recent past in the naxalite affected areas to win hearts and minds of the people. The situation on the ground was becoming very critical as the tribal women were extremely agitated and aggressive. With the multi-pronged strategy of the Central and State Governments especially in the last few years, the naxalite problem has been resolved to a large extent in the affected states of the country. (b) What are the ethical dilemmas being faced by Rohit? (c) Which of the options, do you think, would be more appropriate for Rohit to adopt and why? (d) In the present situation, what are the extra precautionary measures to be taken by the police in dealing with women protesters?. Without wasting any time, Rohit reached the target village with his team and laid out a foolproof cordon and started carrying out a systematic search. However, there are a few pockets in states where the naxalite problem still persists, mainly due to involvement of foreign countries. Rohit is posted as SP (Special Operations) for the last one year, in one of the districts which is still affected by the naxalite problem. However, in the meantime, more than five hundred tribal women surrounded the village and started marching towards the target house, as they are their protectors and saviours. In that case, to control the situation Rohit might have to resort to firing which may lead to valuable loss of lives of civilians and would further complicate the situation. To instil confidence in the public and have moral ascendancy over the naxalites, a number of cordons and search operations are being conducted by the police. Over a period of time, Rohit has established an excellent intelligence network to get the real time information regarding the movement of naxalite cadres.

However, after some time Pawan felt that the senior officer was belittling him and at times unreasonable.

It became apparent that though there were no serious work-related problems/shortcomings, the senior officer was always on one pretext or the other and would scold and shout at him. Initially, all seemed to go well. Rather without any reason he would lose his temper with his wife and other family members. The continuous harassment and public criticism of Pawan resulted in loss of confidence, self-esteem and equanimity. The family environment was no longer pleasant and congenial. He was no longer joyous, happy and content even at home. He joined a new office along with five other colleagues. It became a pattern of boss’ style of functioning to show him in a bad light highlighting shortcomings and humiliating publicly. As a part of general inquiry, Pawan gathered that his senior officer carries the reputation of being a difficult and insensitive person having his own disturbed family life. His wife who was always supportive to him also became a victim of his negativity and hostile behavior. The head of the office was a senior officer conversant with the functioning of the office. As a part of routine transfer, he was posted to another department. Whatever suggestions given or views expressed by Pawan in the meetings were summarily rejected and the senior officer would express displeasure in the presence of others. Pawan realized that his relationship with his senior officer was becoming more toxic and due to this, he felt perpetually tense, anxious and stressed.

His department is presently busy organizing the budgetary support to the states, four of which are due to go to the polls within the financial year. This year’s annual budget had allotted Rs. 8300 crores for the National Housing Scheme (NHS), a centrally sponsored social housing scheme for the weaker sections of society. `775 crores have been drawn for the NHS till June. The Ministry of Commerce had long been pursuing a case for setting up a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in a southern state to boost exports. After two years of detailed discussions between the center and state, the Union Cabinet approved the project in August. The process was initiated to acquire the necessary land. Eighteen months ago, a leading Public Sector Unit (PSU) had projected the need for setting up a large natural gas processing plant in a northern state for the regional gas grid. The required land is already in possession of the PSU. The gas grid is an essential component of the national energy security strategy. After three rounds of global bidding, the project was allotted to an MNC, M/s XYZ Hydrocarbons. The first tranche of payment to the MNC is scheduled to be made in December. The Finance Ministry was asked for a timely allocation of an additional Rs. 6000 crores for these two developmental projects. It was decided to recommend re-appropriation of this entire amount from the NHS allocation. The file was forwarded to the Budget Department for their comments and further processing. On studying the case file, Rajesh Kumar realized that this re-appropriation may cause inordinate delay in the execution of NHS, a project much publicized in the rallies of senior politicians. Correspondingly, non-availability of finances would cause financial loss in the SEZ and national embarrassment due to delayed payment in an international project. Rajesh Kumar discussed the matter with his seniors. He was conveyed that this politically sensitive situation needs to be processed immediately. Rajesh Kumar realized that diversion of funds from the NHS could raise difficult questions for the government in the Parliament. Discuss the following with reference to this case: (a) Ethical issues involved in re-appropriation of funds from a welfare project to the developmental projects. (b) Given the need for proper utilization of public funds, discuss the options available to Rajesh Kumar.

BML had admirably progressed from producing first generation anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) to designing and producing state of the art ATGM weapon systems that would be the envy of any army. He sighed in reconciliation with his assumptions that the government would probably not alter the status quo of a ban on exports of military weaponry. To his surprise, the very next day he got a telephone call from the Director General, Ministry of Defence, asking him to discuss the modalities of increasing BML production of ATGMs as there is a possibility of exporting the same to a friendly foreign country. The Director General wanted the Chairman to discuss the details with his staff at Delhi next week. Two days later, at a press conference, the Defence Minister stated that he aims to double the current weapons export levels within five years. This would give an impetus to financing the development and manufacture of indigenous weapons in the country.

A huge multipurpose mall is under construction in your city in which a large number of daily wage earners are employed. One night, during monsoons, a big chunk of the roof collapsed causing instant death of four laborers including two minors. Many more were seriously injured requiring immediate medical attention. The mishap resulted in a big hue and cry, forcing the government to institute an inquiry. Your preliminary enquiry has revealed a series of anomalies. The material used for the construction was of poor quality. Despite the approved building plans permitting only one basement, an additional basement has been constructed. This was overlooked during the periodic inspections by the building inspector of the municipal corporation. In your enquiry, you noticed that the construction of the mall was given the green signal despite encroaching on areas earmarked for a green belt and a slip road in the Zonal Master Plan of the city. The permission to construct the mall was accorded by the previous Municipal Commissioner who is not only your senior and well known to you professionally, but also a good friend. Prima facie, the case appears to be of a widespread nexus between officials of the Municipal Corporation and the builders. Your colleagues are putting pressure on you to go slow in the enquiry. The builder, who is rich and influential, happens to be a close relative of a powerful minister in the state cabinet. The builder is persuading you to hush up the matter, promising you a fortune to do so.

It has rocky terrain that is not suitable for agriculture, though some subsistence agriculture is being done on small plots of land. The area receives adequate rainfall and has an irrigation canal flowing through it. Amria, its administrative center, is a medium-sized town. It houses a large district hospital, an Industrial Training Institute and some privately owned skill training centers. It has all the facilities of a district headquarters. A trunk railway line passes approximately 50 kilometers from Amria. Its poor connectivity is a major reason for the absence of any major industry therein. The state government offers a 10 year tax holiday as an incentive to new industry. In 2010 Anil, an industrialist, decided to take benefits to set up Amria Plastic Works (APW) in Noora village, about 20 km from Amria. While the factory was being built, Anil hired the required key labor and got them trained at the skill training centers at Amria. This act of his made the key personnel very loyal to APW. APW started production in 2011 with the labor drawn fully from Noora village. The villagers were very happy to get employment near their homes and were motivated by the key personnel to meet the production targets with high quality. APW started making large profits, a sizable portion of which was used to improve the quality of life in Noora. By 2016, Noora could boast of a greener village and a renovated village temple. Anil liaised with the local MLA to increase the frequency of the bus services to Amria. The government also opened a primary health care center and primary school at Noora in buildings constructed by APW. APW used its CSR funds to set up women’s self-help groups, subsidize primary education to the village children and procure an ambulance for use by its employees and the needy. In 2019, there was a minor fire in APW. It was quickly extinguished as fire safety protocols were in place in the factory. Investigations revealed that the factory had been using electricity in excess of its authorized capacity. This was soon rectified. The next year, due to a nationwide lockdown, the requirement of production fell for four months. Anil decided that all employees would be paid regularly. He employed them to plant trees and improve the village habitat. APW had developed a reputation of high-quality production and a motivated workforce.

The pandemic has brought them into national focus. On announcement of a countrywide lockdown, a very large number of migrant workers decided to move back from their places of employment to their native villages. The non-availability of transport created its own problems. Added to this was the fear of starvation and inconvenience to their families. This caused the migrant workers to demand wages and transport facilities for returning to their villages. Their mental agony was accentuated by multiple factors such as a sudden loss of livelihood, possibility of lack of food and inability to assist in harvesting their rabi crop due to not being able to reach home in time. Reports of inadequate response of some districts in providing the essential boarding and lodging arrangements along the way multiplied their fears.

Considering his profile, he was picked up by his bosses to handle a very challenging and sensitive assignment. He was posted in a tribal dominated district notorious for illegal sand mining. Excavating sand from the river belt and transporting it through trucks and selling them in black market was rampant. This illegal sand mining mafia was operating with the support of local functionaries and tribal musclemen who in turn were bribing selected poor tribals and had kept the tribals under fear and intimidation. Sunil being a sharp and energetic officer immediately grasped the ground realities and the modus operandi followed by the mafia through their devious and dubious mechanism. On making inquiries, he gathered that some of their own office employees are hand in glove with them and have developed a close unholy nexus. Sunil initiated stringent action against them and started conducting raids on their illegal operations of movement of trucks filled with sand. The mafia got rattled as not many officers in the past had taken such strong steps against the mafia. Some of the office employees who were allegedly close to the mafia informed them that the officer is determined to clean up the mafia’s illegal sand mining operations in that district and may cause them irreparable damage. The mafia turned hostile and launched a counter-offensive. The tribal musclemen and mafia started threatening him with dire consequences. His family (wife and old mother) were stalked and were under virtual surveillance and thus causing mental torture, agony and stress to all of them. The matter assumed serious proportions when a muscle man came to his office and threatened him to stop raids, etc., otherwise, his fate will not be different from some of his predecessors (ten years back one officer was killed by the mafia).

While carrying out the surprise inspection by the inspection team, a minor crack was noticed in one of the piers of the elevated corridor possibly due to poor material used. You immediately informed the chief engineer and stopped further work. It was assessed by you that a minimum three piers of the elevated corridor have to be demolished and reconstructed.

But the chief engineer overruled the observation of the inspection team on the ground that it was a minor crack which will not in any way impact the strength and durability of the bridge. He ordered you to overlook the observation of the inspecting team and continue working with the same speed and tempo. He informed you that the minister does not want any delay as he wants the Chief Minister to inaugurate the elevated corridor before the elections are declared.

India with a population of more than 1.35 billion had difficulty in controlling the transmission of coronavirus among its population. Multiple strategies became necessary to handle this outbreak. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of India raised awareness about this outbreak and to take all necessary actions to control the spread of COVID-19. The Indian Government implemented a 55-day lockdown throughout the country to reduce the transmission of the virus. Schools and colleges had shifted to an alternative mode of teaching-learning-evaluation and certification. Online mode has become popular these days.

The head of the office was a senior officer conversant with the functioning of the office. As a part of general inquiry, Pawan gathered that his senior officer carries the reputation of being a difficult and insensitive person having his own disturbed family life. Initially, all seemed to go well. However, after some time Pawan felt that the senior officer was belittling him and at times unreasonable. Whatever suggestions given or views expressed by Pawan in the meetings were summarily rejected and the senior officer would express displeasure in the presence of others. It became a pattern of boss’ style of functioning to show him in a bad light highlighting his shortcomings and humiliating publicly. It became apparent that though there were no serious work-related problems/shortcomings, the senior officer was always on one pretext or the other and would scold and shout at him. The continuous harassment and public criticism of Pawan resulted in loss of confidence, self-esteem and equanimity. Pawan realized that his relationship with his senior officer was becoming more toxic and due to this, he felt perpetually tense, anxious and stressed. His mind was occupied with negativity and caused him mental torture, anguish and agony. Eventually, it badly affected his personal and family life. He was no longer joyous, happy and content even at home. Rather without any reason he would lose his temper with his wife and other family members. The family environment was no longer pleasant and congenial. His wife who was always supportive to him also became a victim of his negativity and hostile behavior.

As an Officer he is responsible for managing and coordinating various administrative tasks to ensure smooth functioning of office. Rajesh knows that immediate superior would expect all these purchases should be done at his level, and may not appreciate such lack of initiative on his part. He is now putting extra efforts so that he gets thumping report at the end of financial year. He is posted as Administrative Officer in an Oil Public Sector undertaking. One day he calls Rajesh and wants him to buy computer-related stationary on priority a particular vendor. It is noticed that as per delegated financial powers, as provided in the GFR (General Financial Rules) as applicable in that Organisation, expenditure for office items exceeding Rupees Thirty Lakhs requires sanction of the next higher authority (boss in the present case). He is unsure of taking decision in the matter. During discussions with officer, he learns that common practice of splitting of expenditure (where large order is divided in a series of smaller ones) is followed to avoid obtaining sanction from higher authority. Rajesh is a Group A officer with nine years service. As Administrative Officer, Rajesh is regularly interacting with his immediate boss, who is his reporting officer for writing his ACR. Rajesh is perturbed. He knows that promotion is based on examination of ACRs/Performance Appraisal of last few years (5 years or so) of an officer by a DPC (Departmental Promotion Committee) and an officer lacking requisite grading of ACRs may not be found fit for promotion. Consequences of losing promotion may entail financial and reputational loss and set-back for career progression. He also manages office supplies, equipment etc. Rajesh instructs his office to initiate action for procuring these items. During the day, the dealing Assistant brings an estimate of Rupees Thirty Five Lakhs covering all stationery items from the same vendor. This practice is against the rules and may come to the adverse notice of Audit. Rajesh is now sufficient senior and is expecting his next promotion in JAG (Junior Administrative Grade) in the next one or two years. (a) What are the options available with Rajesh in the above situation? (b) What are the ethical issues involved in this case? (c) Which would be the most appropriate option for Rajesh and why?

Initially, all seemed to go well. Whatever suggestions given or views expressed by Pawan in the meetings were summarily rejected and the senior officer would express displeasure in the presence of others. As a part of general inquiry, Pawan gathered that his senior officer carries the reputation of being a difficult and insensitive person having his own disturbed family life. He joined a new office along with five other colleagues. It became a pattern of boss’ style of functioning to show him in a bad light highlighting his shortcomings and humiliating publicly. However, after some time Pawan felt that the senior officer was belittling him and at times unreasonable. Eventually, it badly affected his personal and family life. As a part of routine transfer, he was posted to another department. The head of the office was a senior officer conversant with the functioning of the office. Due to harassment and humiliation suffered by him in the office, comfort and happiness virtually vanished from his life. It became apparent that there were no serious work-related problems/shortcomings, the senior officer was always on one pretext or the other and would scold and shout at him. Pawan has been working as an officer in the State Government for the last ten years.

Though law is clear on the use of child labour employment norms in registered/non-registered units, it does not include household-based works. (a) Bring out and discuss the ethical issues involved in the above case. Household-based work means children working under the supervision of their parents/relatives. The units in industrial of firecrackers can be classified into registered and non-registered entities. Sivakasi in Tamil Nadu is known for its manufacturing clusters on firecrackers and matches. So far as child labour norms for hazardous industries like firecrackers industry are concerned, International Labour Organization (ILO) has set the minimum age as 18 years. The owner tells you that in his household-based unit, the children are all his relatives. You notice that several children smirk, when the owner tells you this. It has led to tangible economic development and improved standard of living in the area. To evade child labour norms, several units project themselves as household-based works but employ children from outside. Needless to say that employing children saves the costs for these units leading to higher profits to the owners. On your visit to one of the units at Sivakasi the owner takes you around the unit which has about 10-15 below 14 years of age. On deeper enquiry, you figure out that neither the owner nor the children are able to satisfactorily establish their relationship with each other.

But presently the company was passing through the difficult times as the sales were continuously showing a downward trend in the last two quarters. His division, which hitherto had been a major revenue contributor to the company’s financial health, was now desperately trying to procure some big government order for them. But their best efforts did not yield any positive success or breakthrough. His was a professional company and his local bosses were under pressure from their London-based HO to show some positive results. In the last performance review meeting taken by the Executive Director (India Head), he was reprimanded for his poor performance. He assured them that his division is working on a special contract from the Ministry of Defence for a secret installation near Gwalior and tender is being submitted shortly. He was under extreme pressure and he was deeply perturbed. What aggravated the situation further was a warning from the top that if the deal is not clinched in favor of the company, his division might have to be closed and he may have to quit his lucrative job. There was another dimension which was causing him deep mental torture a and agony. This pertained to his personal precarious financial health. He was a single earner in the family with two school-college going children and his old ailing mother. The heavy expenditure on education and medical was causing a big strain to his monthly pay packet. Regular EMI for housing loans taken from banks was unavoidable and any default would render him liable for severe legal action. In the above backdrop, he was hoping for some miracle to happen. There was a sudden turn of events. His secretary informed that a gentleman-SubhashVerma wanted to see him as he was interested in the position of Manager which was to be filled by him in the company. He further brought to his notice that his CV has been received through the office of the Minister of Defence. During the interview of the candidate-Subhash Verma, he found him technically sound, resourceful and an experienced marketeer. He seemed to be well-conversant with tendering procedures and having a knack of follow-up and liaising in this regard. Prabhat felt that he was a better choice than the rest of the candidates who were recently interviewed by him in the last few days. Subhash Verma also indicated that he was in possession of the copies of the bid documents that the Unique Electronics Ltd. would be submitting the next day to the Defence Ministry for their tender. He offered to hand over those documents subject to his employment in the company on suitable terms and conditions. He made it clear that in the process, the Sterling Electric Ltd. could outbid their rival company and get the bid and hefty Defence Ministry order. He indicated that it will be a win-win situation for both-him and the company. Prabhat was absolutely stunned. It was a mixed feeling of shock and thrill. He was uncomfortable and perspiring. If accepted, all his problems would vanish instantly and he may be rewarded for securing the much awaited tender and thereby boosting the company’s sales and financial health. He was in a fix as to the future course of action. He was wonder-struck at the guts of Subhash Verma in having surreptitiously removed his own company papers and offering to the rival company for a job. Being an experienced person,he was examining the pros and cons of the proposal/situation and he asked him to come the next day. (a) Discuss the ethical issues involved in the case.

On deeper enquiry, you figure out that neither the owner nor the children are able to satisfactorily establish their relationship with each other. Needless to say that employing children saves the costs for these units leading to higher profits to the owners.

You confront substantial issues about the business’s environmental footprint. In 2023, your organisation had a significant increase of 48% in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the levels recorded in 2019. The significant rise in energy consumption is mainly due to the surging energy requirements of your data centres, fuelled by the exponential expansion of Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI-powered services need much more computational resources and electrical energy compared to conventional online activities, notwithstanding their notable gains. The technology’s proliferation has led to a growing concern over the environmental repercussions, resulting in an increase in warnings. AI models, especially those used in extensive machine learning and data processing, exhibit much greater energy consumption than conventional computer tasks, with an exponential increase. Although there is already a commitment and goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2030, the challenge of lowering emissions seems overwhelming as the integration of AI continues to increase. To achieve this goal, substantial investments in renewable energy use would be necessary.

Among the various issues and problems/challenges which needed his immediate attention, the issue relating to recruitment of unemployed Youth by an unknown terrorist group, was a matter of grave concern. It was noted that unemployment was relatively high in the state. The problem of unemployment amongst graduates and those with higher education was much more grave. Thus they were vulnerable and soft targets. In the review meeting taken by him with senior officers of DIG Range and above, it came to light that a new terrorist group has emerged at the global level. It has launched a massive drive to recruit young unemployed people. Special focus was to pick young people from particular communities. The said organisation seemed to have the clear objective of utilising/using them for carrying out militant activities. It was also gathered that the said (new) group is desperately trying to spread its tentacles in his state. A definite/reliable intelligence tip was received by the State CID and Cyber Cell that a large number of such unemployed youth have already been contacted by the terrorist outfit/group through social media and local communal organisations and other contacts. The need of the hour was to act swiftly and to check these elements/designs before they assume serious proportions. Discrete inquiries made by the police, through the Cyber Cell revealed that good numbers of unemployed youth are very active on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. On average, many of them were spending. 6-8 hours each day, using electronic devices/internet, etc. It also came to light that such unemployed youth were showing sympathy and endorsing messages received from certain persons, allegedly the contact persons of that global terrorist group. Their social media accounts revealed their strong affinity to such groups as many of them started forwarding anti-national tweets on their WhatsApp and Facebook, etc. It seemed that they succumbed to their ploy and started propagating secessionist ideology. Their posts were hyper-critical of the government’s initiatives, policies and subscribing to extreme beliefs and promoting extremism. (a) What are the options available to Raman to tackle the above situation? (b) What measures would you suggest for strengthening the existing set-up to ensure that such groups do not succeed in penetrating and vitiating the atmosphere in the state? (c) In the above scenario, what action plan would you advise for enhancing the intelligence gathering mechanism of the police force.", "label": "YES", "source": "https://pwonlyias.com/mains-solved-papers-by-year/gs-paper-2024/"}

With the multi-pronged strategy of the Central and State Governments especially in the last few years, the naxalite problem has been resolved to a large extent in the affected states of the country. However, there are a few pockets in certain states where the naxalite problem still persists, mainly due to involvement of foreign countries. Rohit is posted as SP (Special Operations) for the last one year, in one of the districts which is still affected by the naxalite problem. The district administration has taken a lot of developmental works in the recent past in the naxalite affected areas to win the hearts and minds of the people. Over a period of time, Rohit has established an excellent intelligence network to get the real time information regarding the movement of naxalite cadres. To instil confidence in the public and have moral ascendancy over the naxalites, a number of cordons and search operations are being conducted by the police. Rohit, who himself was leading one of the contingents, got a message through his intelligence source that about ten hard core naxalites were hiding in a particular village with sophisticated weapons. Without wasting any time, Rohit reached the target village with his team and laid out a foolproof cordon and started carrying out a systematic search. During the search, his team managed to overpower all the naxalites along with their automatic weapons. However, in the meantime, more than five hundred tribal women surrounded the village and started marching towards the target house, as they are their protectors and saviours. The situation on the ground was becoming very critical as the tribal women were extremely agitated and aggressive. Rohit tried to contact his superior officer, IG (Special Operations) of the state on the radio set and on mobile phone, but failed to do so due to poor connectivity. Rohit was in great dilemma since out of the naxalites apprehended two were not only hard core top insurgents with prize money of ten lakhs on their heads, but were also involved in a recent ambush on the security forces. However, if he did not release the naxalites, the situation could get out of control since the tribal women were aggressively charging towards them. In that case, to control the situation Rohit might have to resort to firing which may lead to valuable loss of lives of civilians and would further complicate the situation. (a) What are the options available with Rohit to cope with the situation. (b) What are the ethical dilemmas being faced by Rohit? (c) Which of the options, do you think, would be more appropriate for Rohit to adopt and why?

The District Collector has been mobilising his subordinate officials to conserve the remaining water reserves to prevent the district from plunging into an acute drinking water crisis. Along with an awareness campaign for conserving water, strict measures have been taken for stopping the over-exploitation of ground-water. Vigilance teams have been deployed to tour the villages and find the farmers who are drawing water from deep borewells or from the river reservoir for irrigation. The farmers are agitated by such action. A delegation of farmers meets the District Collector with their issues and complains that while they are not being allowed to irrigate their crops, big industries located near the river are drawing huge amounts of water through deep borewells for their industrial processes. The farmers allege that their administration is anti-farmer and corrupt, being bribed by the industry. The district needs to placate the farmers as they are threatening to go on a prolonged protest. At the same time, the District Collector has to deal with the water crisis. The industry cannot be closed as this would result in a large number of workers being unemployed.

In 2010 Anil, an industrialist, decided to take benefits to set up Amria Plastic Works (APW) in Noora village, about 20 km from Amria. It houses a large district hospital, an Industrial Training Institute and some privately owned skill training centers. Anil liaised with the local MLA to increase the frequency of the bus services to Amria. By 2016, Noora could boast of a greener village and a renovated village temple. In 2019, there was a minor fire in APW. Anil decided that all employees would be paid regularly. Its poor connectivity is a major reason for the absence of any major industry therein. It has all the facilities of a district headquarters. Amria, its administrative center, is a medium-sized town. It was quickly extinguished as fire safety protocols were in place in the factory. The government also opened a primary health care center and primary school at Noora in buildings constructed by APW. The area receives adequate rainfall and has an irrigation canal flowing through it. While the factory was being built, Anil hired the required key labor and got them trained at the skill training centers at Amria.

APW had developed a reputation of high-quality production and a motivated workforce. APW used its CSR funds to set up women’s self-help groups, subsidize primary education to the village children and procure an ambulance for use by its employees and the needy. APW started making large profits, a sizable portion of which was used to improve the quality of life in Noora. A trunk railway line passes approximately 50 kilometers from Amria.

APW started production in 2011 with the labor drawn fully from Noora village. It has rocky terrain that is not suitable for agriculture, though some subsistence agriculture is being done on small plots of land. Investigations revealed that the factory had been using electricity in excess of its authorized capacity. In 2010 Anil, an industrialist, decided to take benefits to set up Amria Plastic Works (APW) in Noora village, about 20 km from Amria. By 2016, Noora could boast of a greener village and a renovated village temple. Do you consider APW as a role model for development of backward areas? Give reasons.

APW started making large profits, a sizable portion of which was used to improve the quality of life in Noora. The government also opened a primary health care center and primary school at Noora in buildings constructed by APW. The villagers were very happy to get employment near their homes and were motivated by the key personnel to meet the targets with high quality. Anil liaised with the local MLA to increase the frequency of the bus services to Amria. Its poor connectivity is a major reason for the absence of any major industry therein. It was quickly extinguished as fire safety protocols were in place in the factory. A trunk railway line passes approximately 50 kilometers from Amria. It has all the facilities of a district headquarters. APW used its CSR funds to set up women’s self-help groups, subsidize primary education to the village children and procure an ambulance for use by its employees and the needy.

Pursuing this mandate, the district administration proposed clearing a portion of forest land to develop housing for the homeless and economically weaker sections of the society. The proposed land, however, is an ecologically sensitive zone densely populated with age-old trees, medicinal plants and vital biodiversity. Besides, these forests help to regulate micro-climate and rainfalls, provide habitat for wildlife, support soil fertility and prevent land/soil erosion, and sustain livelihoods of tribal and nomadic communities. In spite of the ecological and social costs, the administration argues in favour of the said proposal by highlighting that this very initiative addresses fundamental human rights as a critical welfare priority. Besides, it fulfils the government’s duty to uplift and empower the poor, through inclusive housing development. Further, these forest areas have become unsafe due to wild animal threats and recurring human-wildlife conflicts. Lastly, clearing forest zones may help to curb anti-social elements allegedly using these areas as hideouts, thereby enhancing law and order.

As an Administrative Officer he is responsible for managing and coordinating various administrative tasks to ensure smooth functioning of office. He also manages office supplies, equipment etc. Rajesh is now sufficient senior and is expecting his next promotion in JAG (Junior Administrative Grade) in the next one or two years. He knows that promotion is based on examination of ACRs/Performance Appraisal of last few years (5 years or so) of an officer by a DPC (Departmental Promotion Committee) and an officer lacking requisite grading of ACRs may not be found fit for promotion. Consequences of losing promotion may entail financial and reputational loss and set-back for career progression. Though he also puts his best efforts in official discharge of his duties, yet he is unsure of assessment by his superior officer. He is now putting extra efforts so that he gets thumping report at the end of financial year. As Administrative Officer, Rajesh is regularly interacting with his immediate boss, who is his reporting officer for writing his ACR. One day he calls Rajesh and wants him to buy computer-related stationary on priority from a particular vendor. Rajesh instructs his office to initiate action for procuring these items. During the day, the dealing Assistant brings an estimate of Rupees Thirty Five Lakhs covering all stationery items from the same vendor. It is noticed that as per delegated financial powers, as provided in the GFR (General Financial Rules) as applicable in that Organisation, expenditure for office items exceeding Rupees Thirty Lakhs requires sanction of the next higher authority (boss in the present case). Rajesh knows that immediate superior would expect all these purchases should be done at his level, and may not appreciate such lack of initiative on his part. During discussions with officer, he learns that common practice of splitting of expenditure (where large order is divided in a series of smaller ones) is followed to avoid obtaining sanction from higher authority. This practice is against the rules and may come to the adverse notice of Audit. Rajesh is perturbed. He is unsure of taking decision in the matter. (a) What are the options available with Rajesh in the above situation? (b) What are the ethical issues involved in this case? (c) Which would be the most appropriate option for Rajesh and why?", "label": "YES", "source": "https://pwonlyias.com/mains-solved-papers-by-year/gs-paper-2025/"}
