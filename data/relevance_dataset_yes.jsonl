India\u2019s Disaster Response, A Slippery Slope for Federalism Nov. 29, 2025 Context The inter-governmental transfer of disaster-relief resources in India shows a growing asymmetry between the Union and the States , reflected in the widening gap between assessed needs and actual disbursements. The Centre\u2019s response to the Wayanad landslides has intensified concerns about whether India\u2019s fiscal federal structure is shifting from a cooperative model to a more centralised and conditional regime of disaster-risk finance . As climate shocks intensify, these tensions expose weaknesses in the fiscal foundations of India\u2019s disaster-response system. Growing Strain in India\u2019s Disaster-Financing Framework Greater Central Control The Wayanad tragedy of July 2024, which killed nearly 300 people and damaged thousands of homes, illustrated this imbalance starkly. Against Kerala\u2019s recovery needs of \u20b92,200 crore , the Union approved only \u20b9260 crore , roughly 11% of the requested amount. Similar shortfalls in other States indicate a pattern where cooperative federalism is weakening , and disaster situations have become fiscal stress tests for State budgets. India\u2019s disaster-response financing, established under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 , is built on a two-tier structure. The State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) , funded largely by the Centre, supports immediate relief, while the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) supplements it when calamities are classified as severe. Although this design appears balanced, practice reveals a shift toward greater central control . Outdated and Rigid Relief Norms Compensation ceilings, \u20b94 lakh per life lost and \u20b91.2 lakh for a fully damaged house, have seen minimal revision in a decade, failing to match rising reconstruction costs. A second issue is the ambiguity in classifying disasters as severe , giving the Centre wide discretionary power over access to NDRF support. Third, aid releases are procedural rather than automatic, requiring multiple approvals that delay relief during critical moments. Finally, the Finance Commission\u2019s allocation criteria focus on population and area rather than actual hazard exposure, creating allocations that do not reflect vulnerability to floods, landslides, or cyclones. The Drift Toward Centralisation The Wayanad case highlighted how institutional weaknesses shape outcomes. The Centre pointed to Kerala\u2019s unspent SDRF balance of \u20b9780 crore and an earlier interest-free loan of \u20b9529 crore as grounds to limit additional aid. However, SDRF balances often represent ongoing commitments rather than idle funds, especially because fund instalments arrive late in the fiscal year while disasters are seasonal. SDRF rules also restrict spending to immediate relief , not reconstruction or livelihood restoration, compelling States to retain reserves to address future shocks. Delays in classifying the Wayanad landslides as a severe disaster further restricted Kerala\u2019s access to NDRF funds. Other States, including Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Assam \u2014received larger packages for comparable disasters, exposing inconsistencies in disaster categorisation. Similar mismatches emerged after Cyclone Gaja (2018) in Tamil Nadu and the 2019 floods in Karnataka. Across these instances, the combination of slow approvals, rigid norms, and inadequate allocations reflects a move from cooperative federalism toward bureaucratic negotiation . The Way Forward Learning from Global Models International best practices show how data-driven and rules-based systems can reduce delays and improve accountability. The United States\u2019 FEMA uses per-capita damage thresholds to determine federal support. Mexico\u2019s former FONDEN triggered instant payouts when rainfall or wind-speed thresholds were crossed. The Philippines relies on rainfall and fatality indices , while African and Caribbean regional insurance pools use satellite-based parametric triggers for rapid disbursements. Australia links federal relief to the proportion of State expenditure relative to revenue. These mechanisms demonstrate that clear, objective triggers can minimise discretion and speed up relief. India could adopt triggers such as rainfall intensity, fatalities per million, or loss-to-GSDP ratios to strengthen transparency and trust. Rebuilding the Federal Spirit The Sixteenth Finance Commission has a crucial opportunity to redesign India\u2019s disaster-financing architecture. Key reforms include updating compensation norms to reflect current costs, revising allocation criteria through a comprehensive vulnerability index , and ensuring that assistance remains grant-based rather than debt-based. States should have operational autonomy over disaster funds, with the Union focusing on post-audit verification instead of prior approvals. Such reforms would not weaken central oversight but would reinforce a rules-based, cooperative federal system capable of responding swiftly and equit", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

Delhi\u2019s Pollution Trackers: Functioning, Flaws, and Failures Nov. 27, 2025 Why in news? The Supreme Court has asked authorities to justify whether Delhi\u2019s air-quality monitoring equipment is appropriate for the city\u2019s conditions. Delhi currently operates 40 Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAAQMS), each functioning as a compact, automated laboratory housed in a temperature-controlled cabin. These stations, positioned across the city for representative measurement, monitor eight key pollutants \u2014 PM2.5, PM10, NO\u2082, SO\u2082, CO, O\u2083, ammonia and lead \u2014 as mandated by CPCB\u2019s 2012 guidelines. Inside each dust-proof, air-conditioned unit, racks of analysers, pumps and data loggers process samples drawn through inlets mounted on masts above the station roof. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? How Delhi\u2019s AQI Stations Measure Pollutants? Factors That Distort Air-Quality Readings What Research Reveals About PM Measurement Errors? Ensuring Reliable Air-Quality Data: Calibration, Compliance & Oversight How Delhi\u2019s AQI Stations Measure Pollutants? Delhi\u2019s air-quality monitors use specialised, CPCB-approved techniques to measure each pollutant. Particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) is tracked using Beta Attenuation Monitors, which gauge how dust collected on filter tape reduces beta-ray transmission. Gaseous pollutants are measured through optical and chemical methods: sulphur dioxide via UV fluorescence, ozone by UV photometry, and carbon monoxide with Non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) absorption. NDIR absorption is a gas sensing technology that measures the concentration of a specific gas by analyzing how much infrared light it absorbs. Nitrogen oxides are detected through chemiluminescence , while ammonia is measured using optical spectroscopy. Chemiluminescence is the emission of light as a result of a chemical reaction. Optical spectroscopy is a scientific technique that studies the interaction of light with matter to determine a sample's physical and chemical properties. These instrument-based techniques comply with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards to ensure uniform, reliable data nationwide. Factors That Distort Air-Quality Readings AQI accuracy depends on equipment reliability and the volume of validated data recorded daily. Stations often miss CPCB\u2019s 16-hour data requirement due to shutdowns caused by calibration, power cuts, extreme weather or transmission failures. A recent CAG report found many Delhi stations failed to log complete data or measure key pollutants like lead, weakening daily AQI assessments. Technical issues also distort readings: high humidity inflates particulate measurements, instruments drift without frequent calibration, and poor station siting near buildings or vents skews airflow. Together, these operational and environmental challenges reduce the precision of Delhi\u2019s air-quality readings. What Research Reveals About PM Measurement Errors? Multiple studies show that Delhi\u2019s particulate readings \u2014 especially from Beta Attenuation Monitors (BAM) \u2014 can significantly overestimate pollution under certain weather and loading conditions. A 2021 CSIR\u2013NPL and AcSIR study found that beta gauge accuracy declines sharply when relative humidity (RH) exceeds 60% , causing particles to absorb moisture and appear heavier. The study reported more than 30% overestimation, with bias rising up to fivefold during high-pollution events when particle mass loading is high. Seasonal effects worsen errors, particularly in winter and post-monsoon months. Researchers advised using site-specific correction factors, which lowered biases from 46% to below 2%. The U.S. EPA similarly warns that heavy particle accumulation can disrupt airflow and destabilise readings.

Enabling a Modern and Future-Ready Labour Ecosystem Nov. 28, 2025 Context On November 21, 2025 , India marked a milestone in its long journey toward Viksit Bharat with the implementation of the Four Labour Codes . Together, these reforms represent one of the most ambitious attempts to modernise India\u2019s labour governance framework. They aim to create a fair, future-ready system that supports both the protection of workers and the competitiveness of enterprises, reflecting India's broader aspirations of Aatmanirbhar Bharat and inclusive growth. Evolution of India\u2019s Labour Framework India\u2019s labour laws have historically developed in a fragmented manner, shaped by varying economic contexts and social needs since Independence. The resulting framework, consisting of numerous separate legislations, created complexities for employers and often left gaps or inconsistencies for workers. Recognising these challenges, the Second National Commission on Labour recommended consolidating the many existing laws into broader functional codes. After extensive consultation with stakeholders, including employers, labour unions, and State governments, the Four Labour Codes were enacted between 2019 and 2020. A Large and Dynamic Workforce India\u2019s transformation is underpinned by its demographic strength: with over 643 million workers , it boasts one of the largest and youngest labour forces globally. Between 2017\u201318 and 2023\u201324, the country generated 16.83 crore new jobs , saw unemployment fall from 6% to 3.2% , and witnessed a rise in formal employment. Yet a large share of India\u2019s workers remain in the informal sector , underscoring the urgent need for simplified laws and stronger protections. The new Codes aim to bridge these gaps. The Code on Social Security\u2019s broader coverage, including for unorganised workers, signals a decisive move to extend the benefits of growth and security to those who have traditionally been excluded from formal protections. The Core Objective of Labour Codes: Strengthening Worker Protections Universal minimum wages and a national floor wage establish a more consistent and equitable wage structure. Mandatory appointment letters and timely wage payments reinforce transparency and accountability. A clearer framework for working hours , including the standard 48-hour work week , helps ensure predictability and work\u2013life balance. The OSH Code emphasises workplace safety through mandatory safety committees, free preventive health check-ups, and stronger norms for working conditions. The Social Security Code provides universal ESIC coverage, streamlined EPF processes, and creates a National Social Security Fund addressing the needs of various worker categories. These measures collectively advance worker welfare while supporting productivity and sustained economic growth. Some Other Features of New Labour Codes Simplifying Compliance and Encouraging Formalisation From the perspective of businesses, especially MSMEs, the Codes represent a significant shift toward simpler and more transparent compliance. The introduction of single registration, single licence, and single return mechanisms, reduces administrative burdens and encourages participation in the formal economy. A uniform definition of wages also reduces ambiguity and disputes, promoting predictability in wage calculations and legal compliance. Preparing for the Future of Work The nature of employment in India is rapidly evolving, driven by digital platforms, flexible work arrangements, and the rise of gig and platform-based labour. By including gig and platform workers under the Social Security Code, India has taken a forward-looking step. As this workforce is projected to expand from one crore in 2024\u201325 to 2.35 crore by 2029\u201330 , establishing social protection frameworks early is vital for ensuring sustainable livelihoods and equitable growth. Advancing Women\u2019s Participation in the Workforce Despite recent improvements, women\u2019s labour force participation, at 32.8% , according to the ILO\u2019s India Employment Report 2024, remains below potential. The Labour Codes attempt to address key barriers by: reinforcing equal remuneration , strengthening maternity benefits , extending social protection to women in unorganised and gig sectors, and allowing women to work at night with their consent, supported by safety measures. Balancing Worker Protections and Enterprise Competitiveness A modern labour framework must carefully balance the rights of workers with the needs of businesses. The Labour Codes aim to strike this balance by simplifying industrial relations procedures, improving transparency, and ensuring faster resolution of disputes. This stability is crucial for attracting investment, strengthening India\u2019s integration into global value chains, and enabling industries to grow competitively. Conclusion As the Codes come into force, State-level implementation will be critical.

The INO that wasn\u2019t and the JUNO that is Nov. 27, 2025 Context The completion of China\u2019s Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) marks a major milestone in global particle physics, but for India it carries a bittersweet resonance . While China releases its first scientific results, the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) remains stalled. The contrast between the two projects reveals differing national trajectories in Big Science , shaped by public trust, administrative foresight, and political conditions. The Promise of Underground Neutrino Experiments Neutrinos are among the most elusive particles in the universe. Their ability to pass through matter almost entirely unhindered requires immense underground detectors shielded from background noise. Both JUNO and INO were designed to study neutrino oscillations and determine the neutrino mass ordering , one of the most important open questions in modern physics. While JUNO has reached completion after a delay, INO\u2019s progress has stagnated. JUNO\u2019s success reflects sustained national commitment , whereas INO illustrates how scientific potential can be derailed by administrative missteps and sociopolitical conflict . The Stalling of INO INO\u2019s ambitious 50-kilotonne detector demanded installation inside a mountain in Theni, Tamil Nadu, using natural rock as shielding. However, the combination of large-scale excavation , involvement of the Department of Atomic Energy , and political mobilisation sparked local fears. The project suffered from: Insufficient early community engagement Unanticipated environmental and social sensitivities Bureaucratic delays and litigation These failures coincided with China\u2019s rapid progress, reducing INO\u2019s ability to attract international collaboration and funding . JUNO\u2019s Advancement JUNO\u2019s first scientific papers showcase its technological sophistication and a broad global collaboration involving many countries. The absence of Indian researchers is striking, considering India\u2019s longstanding contributions to neutrino physics . JUNO has already produced a high-precision measurement of \u03b8\u2081\u2082 , one of the key parameters governing neutrino oscillations. This places JUNO in a strong position to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy and explore physics beyond the Standard Model . As JUNO spokesperson Yifang Wang stated, the project is poised for transformative discoveries . Consequences of Missing the Moment INO\u2019s stagnation shows that in frontier science, missing one opportunity can mean missing an entire generation of discovery . The next major questions in neutrino physics will require: More specialised technology Greater international cooperation Larger financial commitments Without renewed investment in scientific infrastructure, India risks losing its place in the global pursuit of fundamental physics . Yet optimism persists. India\u2019s young scientists are skilled , creative , and ambitious . What they need is a supporting system that matches their potential, administratively, politically, and socially. The Way Forward: Rethinking Readiness for Big Science Large-scale scientific initiatives rely not only on technical expertise but also on the ecosystems around them . Successful Big Science requires: Regulatory clarity Environmental responsibility Transparent communication Community participation Citing resource constraints often masks deeper issues. India already operates major observatories and conservation projects, showing that capability is not the problem, coordination and planning are. Conclusion The stories of JUNO and INO highlight how nations shape their scientific futures. China\u2019s persistence has led to a world-leading neutrino experiment , while India\u2019s project remains entangled in avoidable obstacles. Recovering from this setback demands that India strengthen public engagement , long-term planning , and administrative agility . India\u2019s scientific talent is undeniable but the challenge now is ensuring that national systems, political , bureaucratic , social , and infrastructural , rise to support that talent so the country can participate fully in the next era of fundamental scientific discovery .

The Union Agriculture Ministry has released the Draft Seeds Bill 2025, inviting public comments until December 11. The Bill aims to modernise seed regulation by amending the Seeds Act, 1966 and the Seeds (Control) Order 1983 , ensuring quality seeds for farmers while reducing compliance burdens for the seed industry. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Seeds Bill 2025 (Context, Rationale, Regulatory Architecture, Offences & Penalties, Concerns, etc.) Context and Rationale Behind the Seeds Bill 2025 India\u2019s seed sector has undergone a massive transformation since the 1960s, through advances in biotechnology, hybridisation, commercial seed processing, and international trade. According to the Agriculture Ministry, in 2023-24, the national requirement for seeds was 462.31 lakh quintals, while availability reached 508.60 lakh quintals, creating a surplus of 46.29 lakh quintals. Industry associations have argued that the 1966 Act is outdated and ill-equipped to deal with new scientific and commercial realities. Regulatory Architecture Proposed Under the Bill Clear Definition of Stakeholders The Bill defines key actors, farmer, dealer, distributor, and producer, as separate entities engaged in seed use and trade. This creates regulatory clarity across the supply chain. Central and State Seed Committees Two statutory bodies are proposed: Central Seed Committee (27 members) State Seed Committees (15 members) The Central Committee will recommend standards such as: Minimum germination levels, Genetic and physical purity, Traits and seed health norms, Additional quality parameters. The State Committees will advise on the registration of seed producers, dealers, nurseries, and processing units. Quality Control and Registration Systems Mandatory Registration of Seed Processing Units All processing units must register with the State government. This ensures quality control but may increase operational costs for small seed entrepreneurs. To ease compliance for companies operating across multiple States, a Central Accreditation System may be introduced, merit-based, transparent, and uniform. National Seed Variety Register The Bill creates the office of a Registrar responsible for maintaining a National Register of Seed Varieties under the Central Seed Committee. Field trials to determine the Value for Cultivation and Use (VCU) are also standardised in the Bill. Seed Testing Laboratories Central and State seed testing laboratories will be strengthened to: Analyse genetic purity, Assess germination and health parameters, Assist in compliance monitoring. Role of Seed Inspectors Seed inspectors will have search-and-seizure powers under the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, ensuring stronger enforcement against violations. Offences and Penalties The new draft significantly revises the penalty framework compared to the 2019 draft. The Bill classifies offences as: Trivial , Minor , Major , with corresponding penalties. This stronger penal architecture reflects the government\u2019s intent to curb seed fraud and maintain quality standards. Farmers\u2019 Rights and New Safeguards The Bill reiterates that farmers retain the right to save, use, exchange, and sell farm-saved seeds, except under a brand name. This aligns with long-standing protections under Indian law. The draft also links seed regulation to the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers\u2019 Rights (PPV&FR) Act 2001 , attempting to ensure that quality norms and intellectual property rights are harmonised. Concerns Raised by Farmers\u2019 Organisations Farmers\u2019 unions, including the All India Kisan Sabha, have criticised the Bill for: Potential increase in seed costs, enabling large companies to engage in \u201cpredatory pricing.\u201d Risk to seed sovereignty, as centralisation may favour multinational and domestic seed corporations. Dilution of biodiversity protections, arguing that the Bill conflicts with global treaties such as the CBD and the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food & Agriculture. Creating a \u201ccorporatized regulatory structure\u201d that may overshadow the PPV&FR Act\u2019s progressive farmer-centric provisions. These groups demand that the Bill must complement, not undermine, India\u2019s biodiversity and farmers\u2019 rights legal architecture.

Five years after NEP 2020 proposed it, the government is set to table the Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) Bill 2025 in the upcoming Winter Session. The Bill aims to merge the regulatory roles of the UGC, AICTE, and NCTE into one unified authority, marking the second attempt to establish a single higher education regulator in India. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? HECI: India\u2019s Proposed Single Regulator for Higher Education The 2018 HECI Bill: Key Provisions and Why It Stalled Opposition to HECI: Concerns Over Centralisation and Autonomy HECI: India\u2019s Proposed Single Regulator for Higher Education The Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) Bill draws directly from NEP 2020, which recommended replacing the fragmented regulatory structure with a single overarching authority. Currently, India\u2019s higher education landscape is regulated by multiple statutory bodies: the University Grants Commission (UGC) oversees higher education, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) regulates technical and professional education, and the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) governs teacher education. Four Verticals Under HECI NEP 2020 outlines four specialised bodies within HECI: National Higher Education Regulatory Council (NHERC): Regulates all higher education except medical and legal fields. National Accreditation Council (NAC): Serves as the accrediting authority. General Education Council (GEC): Frames academic learning outcomes and standards. Higher Education Grants Council (HEGC): Handles funding and grants (though officials indicate funding may still rest with the government). HECI itself will function as a compact body of eminent experts overseeing the four verticals. Reducing Red Tape and Conflict of Interest NEP 2020 criticised the existing system for being \u201cmechanistic and disempowering\u201d, with concentrated powers, regulatory overlap, and conflicts of interest. The new commission aims to streamline governance, ensure accountability, and eliminate bureaucratic hurdles. Autonomy and Quality Focus The Bill seeks to empower higher education institutions to operate as \u201cindependent self-governing institutions\u201d while ensuring excellence through a transparent accreditation system and enhanced institutional autonomy. The 2018 HECI Bill: Key Provisions and Why It Stalled The government\u2019s first attempt to replace the UGC came through the Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) Bill, 2018. It proposed a new commission with a chairperson, vice-chairperson, and 12 members appointed by the Centre. Since the Bill did not merge AICTE and NCTE, their chairpersons were included as members. The 2018 draft limited HECI\u2019s powers to setting academic standards and granting autonomy while leaving funding authority with the Ministry of Human Resource Development. It also planned an advisory council headed by the HRD Minister and comprising state higher education council heads. However, the Bill drew criticism for potentially centralising authority and creating excessive overregulation . Following strong pushback during public consultations, it was shelved and revisited for alignment with the NEP 2020 framework. Opposition to HECI: Concerns Over Centralisation and Autonomy Fears of Excessive Centralisation Critics argue that the HECI framework concentrates too much authority with the Union government. The 2018 Bill shifted UGC\u2019s financial powers to the MHRD, raising concerns that universities could lose autonomy and become dependent on central directives. Lack of Diverse Representation Opposition leaders objected to the commission\u2019s composition. They noted the absence of representation from disadvantaged groups \u2014 women, Dalits, Adivasis, OBCs, minorities, and persons with disabilities \u2014 while industry stakeholders were prominently included. Apprehensions From States The then CM of Tamil Nadu warned that centralised funding could lead to biased resource allocation. He feared that replacing UGC grants with ministry-controlled funding might shift to a 60:40 Centre-state share, reducing states\u2019 financial autonomy. Parliamentary Panel\u2019s Warning A parliamentary standing committee flagged \u201cexcess centralisation\u201d concerns. The panel noted that while multiple regulators create inconsistency, the proposed HECI model risks trapping state universities between national and state rules, with insufficient state representation in decision-making. Overall Concern Across political and academic circles, the prevailing worry is that HECI could weaken federalism, dilute institutional autonomy, and marginalise key stakeholders in higher education governance.

Post-Facto Environmental Clearances - A Threat to India\u2019s Environmental Jurisprudence Nov. 29, 2025 Context: India faces one of the world\u2019s gravest pollution crises , with 83 of the top 100 most polluted global cities. Amid this deteriorating environmental scenario, the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision (2:1 verdict on Nov 18, 2025) to allow post-facto environmental clearances has triggered deep concern regarding environmental governance and constitutional rights under Article 21 . Background - The Pollution Emergency: Delhi\u2019s toxic air leads to children losing lung function before age 10. Farmers in Punjab and Haryana inhaling carcinogenic particulates annually in winters. Cities witnessing an overload of respiratory Therefore, environmental safeguards are not procedural formalities but life-saving protections. The Supreme Court\u2019s Reversal: Earlier position: In the Vanashakti vs Union of India (May 2025), post-facto environmental clearances declared outright illegal. Recent judgment: SC recalls Vanashakti judgment. Allows retrospective clearances for \u201cpermissible activities\u201d under existing regulatory frameworks. It is seen as an erosion of the principle of prior environmental clearance. Implications of recent judgment: It provides legal amnesty to violators, and undermines preventive environmental governance. It contradicts the constitutional right to clean the environment under Article 21. Why Prior Environmental Clearance Matters? It is derived from Right to Life (Article 21), and includes clean air, clean water, and a healthy environment. Hence, prevention , not post-damage remediation, is the foundation of environmental law, and post-facto approvals reward violators and discourage compliance. Systemic Dilution of Environmental Safeguards (Five Key Examples): Draft EIA Notification 2020 and 2021 OM: The Draft Environmental Impact Assessment Notification 2020 (along with an Office Memorandum of 2021), attempted to institutionalise post-facto clearances. Reduced compliance reporting, public participation, and expanded the list of industries exempt from EIA. The SC\u2019s current judgment dangerously echoes this framework that was widely criticised as pro-industry , anti-environment. Amendments to Forest Conservation Act (FCA): It narrowed the definition of \u201cforest land\u201d, and excluded lands earlier protected under T.N. Godavarman jurisprudence (1996). It allowed strategic/linear projects to bypass safeguards - increased diversion of forests, especially in tribal northeast (NE) India. Sectoral exemptions: Coal, oil and gas, and construction pushed into lower-regulation categories. For instance, projects classified under \u201c B2 \u201d categories require no EIA, no public hearing, and minimal environmental oversight. This has enabled a range of mining and industrial activities to bypass the most important safeguard \u2014 public consultation \u2014 core to environmental democracy . Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification 2018: It significantly weakened protections for fragile coastal ecosystems, allowing construction closer to shorelines. Ecologically fragile coasts, already facing erosion, rising sea levels, and cyclones, were effectively handed over for commercial exploitation at a time when global climate risks demand increased protection, not deregulation. Fast-tracking clearances: Rubber-stamp expert committees cleared over 95% projects (in the last decade) with minimal scrutiny/field verification - turning a safeguard mechanism into a clearance factory . Public hearings have been curtailed or undermined, reducing affected communities to mere spectators in decisions affecting their survival. Challenges and Way Ahead: Court decision emboldens non-compliance - Ensure judicial review remains a bulwark against environmental dilution. Weakens deterrence against polluting industries - Reinforce prior environmental clearance as an inviolable principle . Erodes public trust in regulatory institutions - Strengthen EIA processes with mandatory public hearings. Increased ecological degradation in forests, coasts, tribal areas - Restore broadened definition of forests and safeguard ecological hotspots . Conflict between economic expediency and environmental justice - Reform expert appraisal committees for transparency and accountability. Align national regulations with global climate commitments and SDGs . Conclusion: The SC\u2019s approval of post-facto environmental clearances marks a troubling departure from India\u2019s progressive environmental jurisprudence.

India\u2019s genetically modified (GM) crop adoption has stalled since the approval of Bt cotton in 2006. However, genome-edited (GE) crops are progressing rapidly. In May, two GE rice lines\u2014improved versions of Samba Mahsuri and MTU-1010 \u2014were cleared after multi-location trials in 2023 and 2024. The enhanced Samba Mahsuri line showed a 19% average yield increase, while the GE MTU-1010 variant demonstrated tolerance to saline and alkaline soils. A third GE crop, a canola-quality mustard variety resistant to major fungal diseases and pests, is currently in its second year of trials across 16 locations. If successful, it may be released by August 2026, signalling a new phase in India\u2019s agricultural biotechnology. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? How GE Differs from GM: The Science Behind India\u2019s New Crop Breeding Policy Push for Genome-Edited (GE) Crops in India Building Human Resource Capacity for India\u2019s GE Revolution How GE Differs from GM: The Science Behind India\u2019s New Crop Breeding Genetically modified (GM) crops introduce foreign genes from unrelated species, such as Bt genes from Bacillus thuringiensis used in cotton to produce insect-killing proteins. Genome editing (GE), however, modifies only the plant\u2019s own native genes. Using protein enzymes that act as \u201c molecular scissors ,\u201d GE alters specific DNA sequences to change how a gene functions\u2014without adding foreign DNA. A custom-designed guide RNA directs these scissors to the exact spot in the genome. For India\u2019s new GE rice and mustard lines, scientists used CRISPR-Cas technologies : Cas9 edited the drought-and-salt tolerance gene in MTU-1010 rice and 10 glucosinolate transporter genes in mustard. Cas12a edited the cytokinin oxidase 2 (Gn1a) gene in Samba Mahsuri rice to increase cytokinin levels, boosting the number of spikelets and grain yield. Importantly, Cas proteins\u2014sourced from bacteria\u2014appear only in the first-generation GE plants and are removed in subsequent breeding. The final GE plants are transgene-free, unlike GM crops that retain permanently inserted foreign genes . Policy Push for Genome-Edited (GE) Crops in India GE plants that contain no foreign DNA are exempt from the stringent biosafety regulations applied to GM crops. Under a March 2022 MoEFCC memorandum, GE crops require only approval from an Institutional Biosafety Committee, which must certify that no exogenous DNA is present. This bypasses the earlier requirement of clearance from the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) for field trials, seed production, or environmental release. Because GE crops are considered similar to normal plant varieties, they face minimal regulatory hurdles, enabling faster research, trials, and eventual deployment compared to GM crops. Strong Government Funding Support The government has backed GE crop development through major funding allocations. Research on improved GE rice varieties began in 2018 through the National Agricultural Science Fund. The 2023\u201324 Union Budget allocated \u20b9500 crore specifically for genome editing. Large Pipeline of GE Targets Identified ICAR scientists have mapped and prioritised key genes across major crops for targeted editing: 178 target genes identified in 24 field crops (cereals, pulses, oilseeds, cotton, sugarcane, jute, tobacco). 43 genes identified in 16 horticultural crops (vegetables, fruits, spices). Most of these crops now have full genome sequences available, allowing researchers to locate each gene precisely on its chromosome. Once a gene\u2019s role in a trait is known, it can be specifically edited to improve yield, stress tolerance, nutrition, disease resistance, and more. A Clear Signal of Policy Shift Together, relaxed regulations and major funding underscore the government\u2019s intent to make genome editing a mainstream tool in India\u2019s crop-breeding strategy \u2014 a shift from the stalled GM crop pathway. Building Human Resource Capacity for India\u2019s GE Revolution Training Scientists in Advanced Genome Editing Developing GE crops requires specialised skills. So far, nine ICAR scientists have undergone advanced training in the US, Europe, Australia, and CIMMYT (Mexico), with 12 more scheduled for upcoming international training. Collaboration with Global Leaders in GE In February 2025, the Innovative Genomics Institute (IGI) \u2014 founded by Nobel laureate Jennifer Doudna , co-inventor of CRISPR-Cas9 \u2014 conducted intensive training sessions for IARI scientists and students. IGI also supplied advanced GE tools such as GeoCas9 and CasLambda, expanding India\u2019s editing toolkit beyond Cas9 and Cas12a. Indigenous Breakthrough: India\u2019s Miniature GE Tool A team led by Kutubuddin Ali Molla at the Central Rice Research Institute, Cuttack, has patented a homegrown genome-editing system based on TnpB proteins (Transposon-associated proteins).

Decoding Personality Rights in the Age of AI Nov. 26, 2025 Context: Actors Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan have sued Google and YouTube in the Delhi High Court, accusing them of hosting AI-generated videos that depict them in fabricated \u2014 sometimes explicit \u2014 scenarios. They argue that such deepfakes violate their personality rights, damage their reputation, and threaten financial interests. The case also seeks safeguards to prevent these fake videos from being used to train future AI models. The issue underscores how generative AI blurs the line between real and fake, challenging existing legal protections over one\u2019s identity \u2014 name, image, likeness, and voice. Personality rights, rooted in privacy, dignity, and commercial autonomy, were not designed for the scale and speed of AI manipulation. Deepfakes now fuel misinformation, extortion, and loss of public trust, revealing a growing need for stronger legal and ethical safeguards to prevent the misuse and commodification of human identity. This article highlights how the rise of generative AI and deepfakes is challenging traditional personality rights in India and across the world. The Evolving Legal Landscape of Personality Rights in the Age of AI India\u2019s Hybrid and Reactive Approach India follows a hybrid model rooted in dignity ( Article 21 ) and property-like control. Personality rights are not codified but recognised through landmark judgments: Amitabh Bachchan v. Rajat Nagi (2022): Affirmed personality rights. Anil Kapoor v. Simply Life (2023): Banned AI misuse of Mr. Kapoor\u2019s likeness and \u201cJhakaas\u201d. Arijit Singh v. Codible Ventures (2024): Protected his voice from AI replication. While the IT Act and 2024 Intermediary Guidelines tackle impersonation and deepfakes, challenges remain due to anonymity, global data sharing, and limited enforcement capacity. United States: Property-Based \u2018Right of Publicity\u2019 The U.S. treats personality rights as commercial property that can be licensed or transferred. Key developments: Haelan Labs v. Topps (1953): Separated publicity rights from privacy rights. ELVIS Act, Tennessee (2024): Prohibits unauthorised AI cloning of voices and likenesses. Litigation against Character.AI highlights risks of AI chatbots inducing self-harm or impersonating therapists; courts have rejected First Amendment immunity claims. European Union: Dignity and Consent Framework The EU\u2019s GDPR mandates explicit consent for processing personal and biometric data. The EU AI Act (2024) classifies deepfakes as high-risk, requiring transparency, labelling, and disclosure to prevent manipulation and deception. China: Stricter Consumer-Focused Enforcement Chinese courts emphasise preventing deception: A 2024 Beijing ruling held synthetic voices must not mislead consumers. Another case awarded damages to a voice actor whose AI-replicated voice was sold without consent \u2014 affirming voice as personality property. A Fragmented Global Framework AI\u2019s borderless nature outpaces national laws, creating a fragmented regulatory mosaic. Scholars argue for expanded \u201c extended personality rights \u201d covering style, persona, and creative patterns to protect individuals from exploitative AI training and misuse. The Human\u2013AI Nexus: Ethical and Legal Concerns UNESCO\u2019s Recommendation on the Ethics of AI (2021) provides a rights-based framework emphasising dignity, autonomy, and protection from exploitation. Scholars argue that personality rights must evolve to address AI-generated impersonation and manipulation. Gaps in India\u2019s Legal Architecture Experts highlight India\u2019s fragmented AI laws and call for: statutory definitions of AI, explicit classification of deepfakes as high-risk, clearer regulation of behavioural data processing. They also raise concerns about AI recreations of deceased artists, noting that Indian courts do not recognise personality rights as inheritable. Debates on AI Personhood Critics, however, warn that granting AI legal personhood could dilute human rights protections and complicate liability frameworks. The tension lies between leveraging AI for innovation and preventing erosion of human autonomy and dignity. Need for Robust Indian Legislation The rise of deepfakes exposes structural gaps. India must: codify personality rights, mandate AI watermarking and model transparency, strengthen platform liability, enable cross-border regulatory cooperation. The government\u2019s 2024 deepfake advisory is a first step, but inadequate on its own. Call for Global Harmonisation Adopting and aligning with UNESCO principles can help India prevent ethical deterioration, ensure accountability, and safeguard human identity in the age of generative AI.

UNESCO Bid: Govt to Transform Chhattisgarh\u2019s Ancient Sirpur Site Nov. 29, 2025 Why in news? Sirpur, a 5th\u201312th Century archaeological site in Chhattisgarh, is undergoing a major upgrade as the government seeks UNESCO World Heritage status. A recent joint inspection by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and the Sirpur Special Area Development Authority (SADA) marks a significant step in advancing its nomination. Located two hours from Raipur on the banks of the Mahanadi , Sirpur hosts 34 Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist monuments. The planned facelift includes battery-operated golf carts, digital exhibits, and immersive storytelling modules to enhance visitor experience and strengthen the site\u2019s UNESCO credentials. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? UNESCO World Heritage Tag Sirpur\u2019s Historical Significance What the govt plans to do? UNESCO World Heritage Tag The UNESCO World Heritage tag is an international recognition awarded to cultural or natural sites of \u201coutstanding universal value\u201d \u2014 places considered important for all humankind, transcending national boundaries. Sites may include ancient monuments, historic cities, natural landscapes, ecosystems, or mixed cultural-natural heritage . The designation is given by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee , which evaluates nominations submitted by member countries. Once inscribed, a site gains global visibility, higher tourism potential, and improved opportunities for funding and technical assistance. Importantly, the tag also obligates governments to ensure stronger protection, conservation, and sustainable management of the site. Overall, the UNESCO tag serves as a powerful tool for safeguarding heritage while boosting international prestige, research interest, and local development. Sirpur\u2019s Historical Significance Sirpur \u2014 also known as Shripur or Sripura \u2014 was a vibrant multi-religious urban centre first documented in 1882 by Alexander Cunningham, ASI\u2019s first Director-General. Excavations from the 1950s to the 2000s uncovered a rich tapestry of monuments dating back to the 5th Century AD, showcasing the city\u2019s cultural and architectural splendour. A Multi-Religious Heritage Hub The site contains 22 Shiva temples, five Vishnu temples, 10 Buddhist viharas, and three Jain viharas. It flourished as the capital of Dakshina Kosala under the Panduvanshi and Somavamshi Archaeological remains include palace complexes, markets, residences, stupas, brick temples, meditation cells, and ancient water systems. Remarkable Monuments and Architecture Lakshmana Temple (7th Century) is one of India\u2019s finest brick temples, dedicated to Vishnu. Surang Tila stands on a high terrace with a steep staircase of 37 steps and features a dramatic panchayatana layout The Panchayatana layout is a temple architectural style featuring a central shrine surrounded by four smaller subsidiary shrines at each corner of a square, making a total of five shrines Large Buddhist viharas and stupas point to Sirpur\u2019s role as a major Buddhist centre, including the Tivaradeva Mahavihara with its notable Buddha statue. A Sacred Riverine Cultural Landscape Sirpur\u2019s location along the Mahanadi River enhances its spiritual and cultural significance. The presence of ghats, temples, and ancient settlements forms a rich riverine landscape that aligns with UNESCO\u2019s vision of combined natural and cultural heritage \u2014 strengthening Sirpur\u2019s case for World Heritage status. What the Govt Plans To Do? Tourists currently spend nearly three hours navigating scattered village tracks to see Sirpur\u2019s monuments. The Chhattisgarh government plans to reduce this by an hour through paved heritage pathways and battery-operated vehicles, enabling smoother and eco-friendly movement across the site. Thematic Clusters and Integrated Pathways Sirpur naturally divides into four heritage zones: Buddhist Monastic Cluster Hindu Temple Cluster Civic\u2013Administrative Zone Riverine Sacred Landscape A primary pathway will link all four thematic clusters, while a secondary pathway will provide last-mile access to each monument, ensuring a coherent visitor experience. Land Transfer for Unified Site Management To strengthen conservation and streamline administration, the ASI has requested 30 hectares of state land around the site. This includes land near major monuments, approach routes, buffer zones, and areas needed for heritage management infrastructure. Identified archaeological mounds and zones with high potential will undergo fresh surveys and excavations , allowing ASI to uncover more structures and strengthen Sirpur\u2019s bid for UNESCO World Heritage status.

Constitutional Legacy of the Basic Structure Doctrine and the Call for Indianising Jurisprudence Nov. 30, 2025 Why in News? At the inauguration of the International Mooting Academy at O.P. Jindal University, Chief Justice of India (CJI) Surya Kant, along with other Supreme Court judges, reflected on the constitutional legacy . He highlighted the 1973 Kesavananda Bharati judgment, the centrality of the Basic Structure Doctrine, and the evolving idea of \u2018Indianisation\u2019 of the legal system. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Significance of Kesavananda Bharati Judgment Judicial Perspectives on Basic Structure Kesavananda as a Moral Milestone (CJI) Indianisation of the Legal System Technological Modernisation of Justice System Key Challenges Way Forward Conclusion Significance of Kesavananda Bharati Judgment: Basic Structure doctrine: It is a legal principle, established by the SC in the landmark 1973 case of Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, that states the fundamental features of the Constitution cannot be amended by Parliament. Basic Structure as constitutional conscience: CJI described the Basic Structure Doctrine as \u201cthe conscience that keeps our democracy from drifting into absolutism.\u201d The doctrine is not a mere precedent but a foundational affirmation of constitutionalism and rule of law. An act of constitutional archaeology: The CJI said the doctrine was not \u201cjudicial fancy\u201d but an uncovering of principles embedded within the Constitution. Judges \u201cunearthed\u201d its inherent moral core: liberty, equality, fraternity, human dignity. The living constitution: The Constitution's strength lies not in rigidity but its ability to adapt without losing moral compass. Each generation must interpret it as a \u201c living charge \u201d, not a frozen document. Judicial Perspectives on Basic Structure: Judicial independence and rule of law (Justice B.V. Nagarathna): The doctrine flows from judicial independence, immune from political pressure. It resulted in the protection of the core features (supremacy of Constitution, separation of powers, fundamental rights, judicial review) of the Constitution. Constitutional supremacy (Justice P.S. Narasimha) : Basic Structure is not judicial supremacy but affirmation of constitutional supremacy. Natural rights foundation (Justice M.M. Sundresh) : Basic Structure was never defined because it existed as a natural right embedded in justice, liberty, and equality. Kesavananda as a Moral Milestone (CJI): Resilience of Indian democracy: The judgment proved that a young republic could assert a moral conscience comparable to older democracies. It showcased India\u2019s constitutional culture that bends without breaking. Symbolism - The constitutional khaat: The constitution is like a khaat (text = frame; institutions = legs). Restraint, balance, moral discipline are interlaced ropes that hold everything together. Indianisation of the Legal System: Swadeshi jurisprudence: The SC noted that despite influences from UK and US, Indian interpretation has developed a distinct \u2018swadeshi\u2019 colour. The government also endorsed building a unique Indian jurisprudence. Earlier calls for indianisation: Justice P.N. Bhagwati (1986) : India must not rely on \u201ccrutches of foreign legal order\u201d. Justice N.V. Ramana : Indianisation needed for easy access to justice, especially for rural litigants. Justice S.A. Bobde : Indian texts already reflected concepts such as privacy. Cases citing Indian tradition : Decriminalising adultery and Sabarimala temple entry to women of a certain age quoted heavily from the Manusmriti. Decolonising Indian legal thought: Justice S. Abdul Nazeer criticized over-reliance on colonial jurisprudence and urged recognition of ancient Indian legal thinkers: Manu, Kautilya, Yajnavalkya, Brihaspati, Narada, etc. Technological Modernisation of Justice System: PM (Narendra Modi) : Called for \u201c ease of justice \u201d even for the poorest. Highlighted virtual hearings, translated judgments for greater accessibility. Union Law Minister (Arjun Ram Meghwal) : Judicial competence now requires e-courts, AI-enabled systems . Invoked B.R. Ambedkar\u2019s warning: \u201cFreedom is not a licence to do whatever we want.\u201d Key Challenges: Balancing amendability with constitutional stability : Reconciling Parliament\u2019s power to amend with preservation of Basic Structure. Avoiding judicial overreach vs. ensuring constitutional supremacy : Maintaining legitimacy of judicial review without perceptions of activism. Indianisation vs. universal constitutional values : Integrating indigenous traditions while upholding modern democratic principles. Bridging the accessibility gap : Ensuring that technology-driven reforms reach rural and marginalised populations. Way Forward: Strengthening constitutional culture: Promote civics education and constitutional awareness at all levels. Continued modernisation : Expand e-courts, digital filing, translation tools, and AI-based case management.

The Government of India has announced a major revival plan for the Shipping Corporation of India (SCI), including the purchase of over 200 merchant ships through joint ventures with other PSUs. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Shipping Corporation of India (Evolution, Role in National Interest & Strategic Missions, Decline During Liberalisation, Global Trends, Govt\u2019s Revival Plan) Evolution of the Shipping Corporation of India For decades, the SCI stood as one of the world\u2019s leading national carriers, operating over 120 ships across categories such as oil tankers, gas carriers, chemical tankers, passenger vessels, liners and offshore vessels. SCI symbolised India\u2019s maritime pride, combining national service with commercial capability. SCI also led technological upgrades, introducing the latest German marine engines, operating India\u2019s first LNG carrier, and building vessels in Indian shipyards despite delays and cost overruns. Its diverse fleet and national obligations made it central to India\u2019s maritime economy. Role in National Interest and Strategic Missions Energy Security: Historically, SCI had first rights on transporting India\u2019s oil, making tankers the backbone of its fleet. National Service: It transported civilian workers at concessional rates to the Andaman Islands and supported defence logistics during crises. Risk Operations: During the Iran-Iraq war, SCI tankers bore the word INDIA in large white letters to signal non-hostility and ensure safe passage. Skill Development: SCI\u2019s Mumbai-based training institute in Powai trained thousands of marine professionals who went on to earn significant foreign exchange for India. Decline During Liberalisation The 1990s ushered in the era of Liberalisation-Privatisation-Globalisation (LPG), and Indian maritime policy moved in line with global trade norms. Under WTO rules, India had to dilute preferential treatment for its national carrier in EXIM cargo. Key consequences included: Loss of \u201c right of refusal\u201d over oil cargo, a major revenue source for SCI. Neglect in fleet modernisation, only two ships were ordered in 10 years before the recent purchases. Shrinking tanker capacity and rising average fleet age (18 years, nearing scrapping levels). Collapse of Indian presence in container shipping after cabotage relaxation. India\u2019s share of EXIM cargo carried by Indian vessels fell from 27% earlier to just 7%, illustrating a precipitous decline. COVID-19 and the Reassessment of Strategic Shipping Capacity The pandemic became a turning point. Global freight rates skyrocketed, up to 10 times pre-pandemic levels, as port delays and geopolitical bottlenecks grew. Many global carriers skipped developing country ports, disrupting India\u2019s key exports such as rice and shrimp and affecting essential imports such as rubber. India\u2019s lack of national container capacity left it vulnerable to: Supply chain disruptions High freight costs Loss of export competitiveness This renewed recognition of maritime self-reliance prompted the shift away from privatisation and toward rebuilding SCI. Global Trends Supporting Public Ownership The revival of SCI is not an isolated move. Across the world, governments have increased intervention in strategic sectors: United States: The Biden administration invested billions in semiconductors, while the Trump administration acquired stakes in companies including Intel and U.S. Steel, abandoning earlier reluctance toward industrial ownership. Rare Earth Sector: U.S. government investment has grown due to supply chain vulnerabilities. This global shift toward strategic state-driven industrial capacity strengthens the logic behind reviving SCI. Government\u2019s New Revival Plan for SCI Large-Scale Ship Acquisition Through PSU Joint Ventures The government plans to purchase 200+ merchant vessels for SCI through joint ventures with other PSUs using funds from the Maritime Development Fund. PSU partners, such as oil companies, the Container Corporation of India (CONCOR) and others, will provide long-term assured cargo contracts, enabling SCI to finance new ships sustainably. Rebuilding Container Shipping Capacity One major initiative includes the creation of Bharat Shipping Line, a joint venture of SCI and CONCOR, to buy 20 new container ships, reviving India\u2019s long-neglected container fleet. Balancing Newbuilds and Market Realities While the revival is ambitious, experts note that global ship prices are currently extremely high due to a prolonged post-pandemic shipping boom. Therefore, expansion will be gradual, balancing strategic needs with market conditions. Need to Support Private Indian Shipping Industry experts emphasise that revival efforts should not remain limited to SCI. India\u2019s broader merchant shipping capacity can grow only if private operators also receive: Long-term cargo contracts Support for capital investment A competit", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

Reversing India\u2019s Brain Drain - A Strategic Push to Repatriate Star Faculty Nov. 27, 2025 Context: The Government of India is considering a new scheme to attract \u201cstar faculty\u201d and researchers of Indian origin back to the country. This comes at a time when the US academic environment is witnessing rising political interference, prompting globally mobile scholars to explore more stable and autonomous research ecosystems. The initiative aims to strengthen India\u2019s R&D ecosystem, boost STEM capacity, and enhance India\u2019s position as a global knowledge economy . Need for the Scheme: Emerging global opportunity: Increasing political intervention, threats to university autonomy and academic freedom in the US. Global academic talent actively seeking stable and supportive research environments. Addressing India\u2019s long-standing \u201cBrain Drain\u201d: Chronic outflow of Indian-origin scientists, especially in STEM. Critical need to strengthen national innovation capacity and build world-class research institutions. Strategic focus areas: Initial emphasis on priority STEM sectors essential for national capability building. Key Features of the Proposed Scheme: Set-up grant: Substantial financial assistance for star faculty to build labs, teams, and research ecosystems in premier institutions. Supports operational autonomy and smoother onboarding. Creating a seamless experience: Returning academics require far more than monetary incentives\u2014intellectual freedom, cultural alignment, and ease of doing research are crucial. Challenges: Salary and compensation gaps: Indian full professors earn approximately $40,000/year, significantly lower than the US ($130,000\u2013$200,000/year) and China (~$100,000/year). India, unlikely to match global salary benchmarks, must compensate with intellectual, cultural and research ecosystem returns. Administrative and structural barriers: Bureaucratic hurdles in logistics, procurement, funding flows, recruitment. Previous programmes (e.g., VAJRA Faculty Programme ) suffered from procedural delays, funding uncertainty, and fragmented short-term engagement mechanisms. Lack of institutional preparedness: Many public institutions lack experience in onboarding international faculty. Persistent hierarchical structures, limited interdisciplinary collaboration, and inadequate academic freedom. Personal and social ecosystem gaps: Challenges in spousal employment, housing, schooling for children, and lack of well-defined tenure-track pathways. Competition from other countries: India must undertake deeper reforms to stay competitive with - Europe - Strengthening academic freedom China - Aggressive recruitment and high funding Taiwan - Rapid internationalisation of universities Limited scope of proposed institutions: Reports suggest the scheme may be confined to a small set of public research institutes, ignoring the rising research capacity of Central-State-Private universities. Institutional Reforms Needed: Administrative autonomy and red carpet mandate: Ensure seamless procurement, funding flows, hiring processes, lab setup. Use expanded autonomy for non-government procurement. Clear tenure-track and career security: Move beyond fragmented fellowship-type programs. Establish explicit tenure-track conversion pathways. Strong protection of academic freedom : High-level government assurance of autonomy, non-interference, freedom from excessive monitoring, essential to attract global researchers. Intellectual Property (IP) clarity : Standardised and clear IP ownership policies, especially for scientific research. Building a supportive social ecosystem: Institutional support for spousal employment, housing facilities, quality schooling. Cultural transformation: Shift from rigid hierarchies to interdisciplinary collaboration; merit-based advancement; open, critical inquiry; and integration of international pedagogic practices. Broadening institutional participation: Include capable central, state, and private universities to maximise the scheme\u2019s impact. Conclusion: The proposal to repatriate Indian-origin star faculty is a timely intervention that aligns with India\u2019s ambition to become a global research and innovation hub. However, success will depend not on grants alone but on the depth of structural, administrative, and cultural reforms undertaken by India\u2019s premier institutions. If implemented holistically, the initiative could reverse the country\u2019s brain drain, catalyse a world-class research ecosystem, and position India as a global leader in knowledge production. The moment is strategic, and India must seize it.

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has released a revised draft of the Bharat New Car Assessment Programme (Bharat NCAP) , updating the 2023 version that is valid until September 2027. The new draft significantly broadens the programme\u2019s scope by adding new mandatory crash tests, revised scoring criteria, and expanded assessment verticals. A major shift in the draft is the inclusion of vulnerable road user (VRU) protection tests, especially for pedestrians, who make up over 20% of road accident fatalities in India. For the first time, vehicles will be evaluated on pedestrian safety features such as impact protection, braking systems, and design elements that reduce injury risks. Overall, the revised Bharat NCAP aims to enhance road safety by encouraging manufacturers to produce vehicles with higher crashworthiness and better protection for both occupants and pedestrians.

Cars are tested using India-specific crash protocols, and those performing best receive a five-star safety rating. Designed to give Indian consumers clearer safety information, Bharat NCAP aligns with global NCAP models but adapts them to Indian conditions and technologies. Manufacturers can voluntarily submit vehicles for testing and use the ratings in marketing. The Central Institute of Road Transport (CIRT), Pune, is the authorised agency for issuing Bharat NCAP ratings.

Instead of the earlier three verticals \u2014 AOP (Adult Occupant Protection), COP (Child Occupant Protection), and SAT (Safety Assist Technologies) \u2014 the new programme rates vehicles across five assessment areas: Safe Driving \u2013 10% Accident Avoidance \u2013 10% Crash Protection \u2013 55% Vulnerable Road User Protection \u2013 20% Post-Crash Safety \u2013 5% This gives a more holistic picture of a vehicle\u2019s overall safety performance. More Comprehensive Crash Tests The earlier version required three crash tests. Bharat NCAP 2.0 increases this to five mandatory crash tests: 64 km/h frontal impact against a deformable barrier 50 km/h lateral impact with a mobile deformable barrier 32 km/h oblique side impact against a rigid pole 50 km/h frontal impact against a full-width rigid barrier 50 km/h rear impact against a mobile rigid barrier These tests help assess injury risk in real-world crash scenarios. Enhanced Injury Assessment Using Anthropomorphic Test Devices (ATDs) (crash-test dummies), the new draft evaluates injury risk for: Adult occupants Driver, front passenger and rear-seat occupants Child occupants This ensures a more precise measurement of protection across all seating positions. Protection for Vulnerable Road Users For the first time, Bharat NCAP incorporates tests to assess: Pedestrian injury risk Cyclist safety measures This addresses India\u2019s high share of pedestrian fatalities. Vulnerable Road User Protection: Key Safety Measures in Bharat NCAP 2.0 Bharat NCAP 2025 introduces a dedicated Vulnerable Road User Protection vertical with 20% weightage, assessing how well vehicles protect pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists during crashes. Mandatory Impact Tests Pedestrian legform impact on the vehicle bumper Adult headform impact on the bonnet/windshield Child headform impact on the bonnet/windshield These tests evaluate how vehicle design minimizes injury during collisions. Optional AEBS Assessments Performance of Autonomous Emergency Braking Systems (AEBS) is assessed for: Child pedestrian detection Adult pedestrian detection Car-to-motorcyclist rear-end scenarios Accident-Avoidance Technologies This new vertical focuses on driver-assist technologies that help prevent crashes before they occur. Key Requirements Electronic Stability Control (ESC) : Mandatory for eligibility under Bharat NCAP 2.0 ESC helps maintain vehicle stability, especially during skids or sudden manoeuvres. AEBS : Optional but encouraged to enhance star ratings Post-Crash Safety Measures A new vertical ensures vehicles help protect occupants after a crash. Mandatory Evaluations Energy Management for Fire & Electrical Hazards - Ensures protection from electric shocks, especially in EVs Occupant Extrication Assessment - Checks ease of door opening; Evaluates seatbelt buckle release after collision. These measures ensure emergency responders can rescue occupants quickly.

Every winter, Delhi sinks into its usual toxic smog, and India reaches for the same short-term fixes \u2014 cloud seeding, smog towers, water sprinkling, odd-even rules, and festival crackdowns. These highly visible measures create an impression of action but barely change actual air quality. Public discourse deteriorates just as fast: scientists are accused of weak solutions, politicians of lacking resolve, and administrators of copying Western models without local adaptation. While each criticism holds some truth, none captures the full systemic failure. This year, frustration spilled into small but peaceful public protests near India Gate. Around 50\u201360 people gathered on November 24, only to face heavy police presence, and five protesters were detained \u2014 reflecting both civic desperation and administrative defensiveness. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article:? Fragmented Governance Fuels India\u2019s Pollution Crisis Why India\u2019s Pollution Policies Fail: The Intellectual and Western Traps Building India-Specific Clean-Air Solutions Fragmented Governance Fuels India\u2019s Pollution Crisis India\u2019s repeated reliance on short-term pollution fixes stems from a deeper structural flaw : air-quality management is fragmented across numerous agencies. Responsibilities are split among the Environment Ministry, CPCB, SPCBs, CAQM, DPCC, municipal bodies, and sectoral departments such as agriculture, transport, industry, and energy. With each institution overseeing only a slice of the problem, no agency has full authority or accountability for clean air. Governance Constraints and Institutional Weaknesses Environmental powers are constitutionally shared, budgets and manpower vary widely, and judicial pressure prioritises quick actions over long-term planning. With many actors involved but none empowered to lead, sustained progress becomes difficult. Short-Term Measures Dominate The dominance of quick fixes is also rooted in political incentives. High-visibility measures \u2014 cloud seeding, smog towers, anti-smog guns, odd-even rules \u2014 allow governments to show immediate action without challenging powerful polluting sectors like construction, transport, and agriculture. They cost little, fit easily into annual budgets, and avoid political backlash. These interventions respond to headlines rather than the science of pollution control, providing momentary relief while doing little to improve public health. Political Optics Over Public Health Short-term measures help officials signal responsiveness during pollution spikes but fail to address structural issues such as waste burning, fuel quality, industrial emissions, and crop residue management. As a result, the air remains hazardous, and winter pollution keeps returning, exposing systemic gaps that require long-term, coordinated reform rather than symbolic actions. Why India\u2019s Pollution Policies Fail: The Intellectual and Western Traps India\u2019s pollution strategies are often shaped by elite institutions, think tanks, and top scientific bodies. While analytically strong, these actors are frequently removed from the lived realities of municipal governance \u2014 understaffing, limited budgets, informal economies, and political constraints. As a result: Policies look good on paper but falter in execution. Strategies underestimate enforcement challenges and administrative gaps. Many remain pilots, unable to scale due to lack of institutional support. This trap prioritises what should work in theory over what can work in practice. The Western Trap: Copying Global Models Without Local Adaptation India routinely imports \u201cbest practices\u201d from Europe, East Asia, and the West, assuming they can function the same way here. However, India\u2019s conditions differ sharply: High-density neighbourhoods Informal construction and transport sectors Weak regulatory credibility Limited institutional trust and administrative coordination When applied without contextual redesign, global models collapse under India\u2019s resource constraints and socio-political complexities. The issue isn\u2019t foreign ideas \u2014 it\u2019s the lack of localisation. Building India-Specific Clean-Air Solutions To overcome the intellectual and Western traps, India must adapt global ideas to its own administrative, political, and social realities. Even strong solutions need redesign to fit local constraints. Need for Clear Leadership and Accountability India\u2019s air-quality governance lacks clarity on: Who leads, Who coordinates, and Who is accountable across national, State, and municipal levels. A modern clean-air law with explicit mandates could streamline roles, reduce jurisdictional overlaps, and ensure steady implementation. Strengthening Institutions Through Stable Systems Effective air-quality management requires: Multi-year funding to build staff and maintain equipment Public access to compliance data to build credibility Visible enforcement to e", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

The Supreme Court\u2019s Central Empowered Committee (CEC) has advised the Goa government to create a tiger reserve in the State. It suggested doing this in a phased manner , indicating a gradual approach to setting up the reserve. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Why the CEC Recommended a Tiger Reserve in Goa? How the Goa Government Responded to the Tiger Reserve Order? CEC Recommendation for Goa\u2019s Tiger Reserve Why the Tiger Reserve Designation Matters? How a Tiger Reserve Is Declared in India? Why the CEC Recommended a Tiger Reserve in Goa? The CEC\u2019s recommendation is rooted in earlier judicial and conservation actions. In July 2023, the Bombay High Court directed the Goa government to declare five protected areas as a tiger reserve within three months. These five protected areas were: Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary, Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary, Bhagwan Mahavir National Park, Netravali Wildlife Sanctuary, and Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary. The order followed a petition by the Goa Foundation after a tigress and her three cubs were allegedly poisoned in the Mhadei Sanctuary in 2020. The Court also asked the State to prepare a Tiger Conservation Plan and settle the rights of Scheduled Tribes and forest dwellers. Notably, the National Tiger Conservation Authority had already recommended these areas for tiger reserve status in 2016. How the Goa Government Responded to the Tiger Reserve Order? The Goa government challenged the High Court\u2019s directive by filing a Special Leave Petition in the Supreme Court, claiming that declaring the areas as a tiger reserve would affect nearly one lakh people. However, its own affidavit later revealed a much smaller number \u2014 roughly 1,274 households across 33 villages, amounting to 5,000\u20136,000 people. The State also argued that Goa had no \u201cresident\u201d tigers and that those seen in its forests were merely \u201ctransient.\u201d This stance contradicted its 2018 submission before the Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal, where it had asserted evidence of a resident tiger population. It had, then, described Goa\u2019s forests as part of a contiguous tiger landscape linked to Karnataka\u2019s Kali Tiger Reserve and Bhimgad Wildlife Sanctuary. Due to these conflicting claims, the Supreme Court asked the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) to conduct a site visit and examine the matter. CEC Recommendation for Goa\u2019s Tiger Reserve The CEC\u2019s report acknowledged fears among local residents about displacement and stressed that the Goa government must reassure affected communities. It proposed creating the tiger reserve in phases, beginning with areas that are ecologically sensitive, least inhabited, and directly connected to Karnataka\u2019s Kali Tiger Reserve , which has a permanent tiger presence. Core Zone (Phase 1) Include protected areas contiguous with Kali\u2019s core area Netravali Wildlife Sanctuary \u2014 50 households Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary \u2014 41 households Total core area recommended: 296.7 sq km Buffer Zone (Phase 1) Include areas adjoining the buffer zone of Kali Tiger Reserve with minimal habitation Northern Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary \u2014 9 households Bhagwan Mahavir National Park \u2014 2 households The CEC said this phased approach would minimise community disturbance while strengthening landscape connectivity and ecological functionality across the Goa\u2013Karnataka tiger habitat network. Why the Tiger Reserve Designation Matters? Declaring an area a tiger reserve brings in greater funding for conservation, research, and habitat management compared to existing wildlife sanctuaries. It also requires dividing the landscape into core and buffer zones. Core zones must remain inviolate, meaning human presence is discouraged. Residents cannot be forced out, but they may be offered incentives to voluntarily relocate. Buffer zones allow regulated human activities and do not need to be free of habitation. This zoning helps strengthen tiger protection while balancing community interests. How a Tiger Reserve Is Declared in India? To create a tiger reserve, the state government first identifies a suitable area and submits a detailed proposal to the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) . The NTCA evaluates the site\u2019s ecological suitability and tiger habitat potential, then forwards its recommendation to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC). Following this, the state issues a preliminary notification, invites and addresses objections, and finally issues a formal notification under Section 38V of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, officially designating the area as a tiger reserve.

Economists expect India\u2019s Q2 FY26 GDP to surpass the RBI\u2019s 7% forecast, potentially reaching 7.3%, slightly below the previous quarter\u2019s 7.8% high. Growth remains robust despite 50% US tariffs introduced in late August. Broad-based rural recovery, supported by strong labour markets and good crop output, along with increased urban consumer durable spending following GST cuts, is driving the expansion. Q3 FY26 is also expected to benefit from the GST cuts. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Nominal GDP Growth Slows, Poses Risks to Budget Targets GDP Growth Likely Lags GVA Due to Slower Tax Collections Q2 FY26 Sees Surge in Private Consumption Q2 FY26 Sees Strong Corporate Profits Amid Low Inflation Government Capex Surges, Private Investment Shows Early Signs of Revival Nominal GDP Growth Slows, Poses Risks to Budget Targets April-June GDP data showed nominal growth at a three-quarter low of 8.8%, below the Finance Ministry\u2019s 10.1% Budget assumption. Nominal growth refers to the growth of an economic variable without adjusting for inflation. In other words, it measures the increase in value at current prices , so it includes the effects of rising prices (inflation) along with the actual increase in output or income. Economists expect July-September and FY26 nominal growth could fall below 8%, potentially impacting tax collections and raising fiscal deficit and debt-to-GDP ratios, despite strong real growth of 7.8%. Fiscal deficit is the gap between the government\u2019s total expenditure and its total revenue (excluding borrowings) in a financial year. Debt-to-GDP ratio measures a country\u2019s total government debt relative to its GDP. It shows the government\u2019s ability to repay debt. A higher ratio means debt is growing faster than the economy, which can strain public finances. Monitoring nominal GDP is crucial for fiscal planning. GDP Growth Likely Lags GVA Due to Slower Tax Collections In Q2, GDP growth may trail GVA growth, projected at 7.5\u20138% versus 8% GVA growth. GDP (Gross Domestic Product): It measures total value of goods and services produced within a country in a given period. It is calculated as GVA + net indirect taxes (indirect taxes minus subsidies). GVA (Gross Value Added) \u2013 It measures total value of goods and services produced by all sectors, excluding net indirect taxes. It indicates actual production and sectoral performance. GDP growth can differ from GVA growth if net indirect taxes rise or fall. GDP includes net indirect taxes (GST minus subsidies), which fell year-on-year after a 10% rise in Q1. Slower growth in these taxes explains why GDP growth may be lower than GVA. Q2 FY26 Sees Surge in Private Consumption Private consumption likely rose by 8% in Q2 FY26, the highest since Q3 FY25. It was boosted by the late-September GST rate cuts, low retail inflation (1.7%), rural wage growth (~6%), personal income tax cuts, and a 7.8% rise in employee costs of listed companies. Growth could have been higher if households had not delayed purchases ahead of the GST rollout. Q1 FY26 consumption had risen to 7% from 6% in Q4FY25. Q2 FY26 Sees Strong Corporate Profits Amid Low Inflation Q2 FY26 was the best quarter for companies in two years, with sales up 6% YoY and profits rising 13%, aided by low retail inflation (1.7%) and zero wholesale inflation. Limited impact from US tariffs and subdued input costs boosted profitability, supporting value-added growth and likely contributing to GDP growth around 7% for FY26, above the RBI\u2019s 6.8% forecast. Government Capex Surges, Private Investment Shows Early Signs of Revival In Q2 FY26, Central government capital expenditure rose 31% YoY to \u20b93.06 lakh crore, supporting overall investment. Private sector interest also increased, accounting for 71% of fresh investments in H1 FY26 versus 61% last year. Q1 FY26 gross fixed capital formation grew 7.8%, down from 9.4% in the previous quarter but above 6.7% in Q1 FY25.

The Union Cabinet has approved a Rs. 7,280-crore scheme to establish India\u2019s first integrated manufacturing ecosystem for Sintered Rare Earth Permanent Magnets (REPMs). What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Rare Earth Magnet Scheme (Rationale, Key Features, Strategic Significance, Industry Response, Global Context, Challenges, etc.) Rationale for the Rare Earth Magnet Scheme India currently imports almost all the rare earth permanent magnets it uses, around 900 tonnes annually, despite having the world's 5 th largest rare earth reserves. These magnets are among the strongest permanent magnets and are indispensable to high-tech systems: EV traction motors, power steering, wiper motors, braking systems, Wind turbine generators, Consumer electronics and industrial equipment, Aerospace and defence applications. Demand is expected to double by 2030, driven primarily by the EV and renewable energy sectors. The disruptions caused by Chinese export controls in 2024-25 further underlined the need for India to develop secure, domestic REPM capabilities. Key Features of the Approved Scheme 7,280-Crore Outlay with Dual Incentive Structure As detailed across the three reports, the financial structure includes: Rs. 6,450 crore in sales-linked incentives (spread over five years), Rs. 750 crore in capital subsidy for setting up facilities. This is part of a seven-year scheme period, two years for plant establishment and five years for incentive disbursement. 5 Beneficiaries via Global Competitive Bidding The total capacity of 6,000 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) will be allocated to five selected manufacturers, each eligible for up to 1,200 MTPA. Applicants will be chosen through a transparent international bidding process. End-to-End Integrated Manufacturing Beneficiaries must build full-stack facilities capable of converting: rare earth oxides > metals > alloys > finished magnets . This integration is central to reducing India's reliance not only on finished REPMs but also on upstream value chains currently controlled by foreign markets. Strategic Importance for India\u2019s Clean-Tech and Defence Ecosystem Boosting Electric Mobility & Renewable Energy REPMs, especially Neodymium-Iron-Boron (NdFeB) magnets, are crucial for efficient and powerful EV motors. The auto sector welcomed the scheme as a major step toward a stable, localised component supply chain, reducing risks of shortages and preventing EV price escalation. Strengthening Defence and Aerospace Capabilities Magnets are critical in precision-guided munitions, unmanned systems, avionics, and radar technologies. Local manufacturing enhances India\u2019s defence security and reduces dependence on geopolitically sensitive supply chains. Alignment with Net Zero and Critical Minerals Strategy The scheme aligns with India\u2019s target of Net Zero by 2070 and builds on the National Critical Minerals Mission , which identifies REPMs as strategic components for energy transition and advanced manufacturing. Experts highlighted that this initiative will catalyse mining, processing, alloying, and high-value materials research. Industry Response and Global Context Automobile & Component Manufacturers Automotive bodies termed the decision pivotal for India\u2019s long-term competitiveness and integration into global value chains. They emphasised that local REPM production would: reduce import dependence, protect manufacturers from Chinese export restrictions, unlock investments in advanced mobility technologies. China\u2019s Dominance and Supply Chain Constraints Globally, China controls over 80% of REPM processing and has increasingly tightened export controls, impacting EV and electronics manufacturers worldwide. Indian automakers faced procurement delays due to prolonged Chinese approval procedures requiring end-user licences and bureaucratic clearance. This backdrop makes India\u2019s initiative not merely economic but geostrategic, ensuring insulation from external shocks. Implementation Challenges and Considerations Experts caution that success depends on: securing advanced technologies for processing and sintering, building high-purity oxide-to-metal conversion capabilities, maintaining ESG standards, responsible mining, and sustainable extraction, ensuring disciplined execution and adherence to global quality benchmarks. These are essential for India to eventually compete in the global REPM market. newspaper.pdf ( Size: 461.8 KB ) Latest Article See All IndiGo Meltdown Dec. 5, 2025, 2:34 p.m. Economics India to Expand Its Busiest Rail Corridors: What\u2019s Planned Dec. 5, 2025, 2:08 p.m. Economics Census 2027 - Counting India, Renewing the Republic Dec. 5, 2025, 1:54 p.m. Editorial Analysis Health and National Security Cess on Demerit Goods Dec. 5, 2025, 1:48 p.m. Economics A Missing Link in India\u2019s Mineral Mission Dec. 5, 2025, 1:33 p.m. Editorial Analysis A Day to Pause and", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

A Landmark Law in 2013, It Needs a Spine in 2025 Nov. 26, 2025 Context A rare instance of accountability in Chandigarh, where a college professor was dismissed after an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) probe under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act/ POSH Act 2013 . This incident has highlighted both the potential and the limitations of India\u2019s institutional mechanisms against sexual harassment. While the verdict has been celebrated as justice served , it simultaneously exposes systemic challenges that prevent consistent and empathetic implementation of the law, particularly within educational spaces marked by sharp power imbalances . The Limits of Consent and the Missing Idea of Informed Consent One of the fundamental gaps in the POSH framework lies in its narrow understanding of consent . The Act acknowledges consent but ignores informed consent , a concept especially crucial in academic and workplace hierarchies. A relationship that appears consensual on the surface may be shaped by emotional manipulation, authority, or information asymmetry . When these imbalances become visible later, earlier consent becomes void and results not only in harassment but in deep emotional betrayal . The current legal framework remains oriented toward visible, explicit acts , failing to recognise psychological or manipulative behaviour. Many well-educated perpetrators deliberately operate in grey zones , avoiding behaviours that leave clear evidence while exploiting trust and emotional vulnerability. The absence of recognition for emotional harassment and coercive, deceptive conduct leaves survivors without adequate legal protection. Procedural and Linguistic Limitations: Barriers to Justice The Three-Month Limitation Period Several procedural elements of the Act inadvertently hinder survivors. The three-month limitation period for filing complaints is particularly restrictive. Survivors who experience coercion or prolonged manipulation often take far longer to recognise the violence or gather the courage to report it. In universities, where students may remain under the same institutional umbrella for years, crucial evidence or realisation may emerge well beyond this timeline. Justice should not come with an expiry date, yet the existing rule reinforces perpetrators\u2019 belief that time is on their side. Linguistic Limitations Language also shapes how seriously misconduct is perceived. The Act refers to the accused as a respondent , softening the gravity of actions that would constitute criminal offences outside institutional settings. Such diluted terminology normalises the violation and diminishes the psychological trauma experienced by survivors. The Burden of Proof The burden of proof further tilts the scales against complainants. Sexual harassment usually unfolds as a pattern of behaviour rather than as a single, documentable event. Yet ICCs often dismiss complaints due to lack of direct evidence, without considering corroborative testimony, anonymous feedback, or circumstantial indicators . While committees are carefully structured to protect the respondent\u2019s rights, similar institutional trust is rarely extended toward recognising a survivor\u2019s lived experience. Inter-Institutional Misconduct: A Silent Blind Spot Modern academia thrives on collaboration, conferences, visiting faculty programmes, and inter-campus research. Misconduct, therefore, often spans institutional boundaries. The POSH Act, however, provides no mechanism for inter-institutional complaints , leaving repeat offenders free to move across campuses without accountability. For survivors, filing a complaint is already an emotionally exhausting battle . What follows is frequently marked by delays, bureaucratic hesitation, and the threat of counteraction. The clause allowing punishment for malicious complaints , intended as a safeguard, often intimidates genuine victims, deterring them from seeking justice. Digital Harassment and the Challenge of Evidence With communication increasingly shifting to digital platforms, harassment now occurs through vanishing messages, encrypted chats, or temporary images. Expecting ICC members, often without specialised technical training, to interpret such evidence is unrealistic. The Act has not adapted to the complexities of digital communication, offering no clear protocols for handling such material. To remain relevant, the law must integrate updated definitions of digital harassment, mandate training for ICC members , and establish procedures for managing electronic evidence so that technology does not become a shield for offenders . The Way Forward: Toward a Stronger and More Responsive POSH Framework The Chandigarh case demonstrates what a committed ICC and a determined group of complainants can achieve, but such outcomes are far from the norm.

India\u2019s GDP growth for Q2 FY26 (July-September 2025) surged to 8.2%, marking a six-quarter high, driven by strong performance in manufacturing, construction, and financial services. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? India\u2019s GDP Performance (Overview, Sectoral Performance, Consumption & Investment Trend, Growth Outlook, etc.) Overview of India\u2019s GDP Performance in Q2 FY26 India\u2019s economy outpaced expectations, recording 8.2% real GDP growth , significantly higher than the consensus forecast of around 7.3%. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of acceleration, signalling robust economic momentum despite global uncertainties. The government attributed this growth to a combination of pro-growth reforms, elevated public investment, strong services activity, and rising private consumption, particularly after the recent GST rate cuts that boosted discretionary spending. Sectoral Performance Driving GDP Expansion Manufacturing and Industry Rebound Manufacturing GVA rose by 9.1% in Q2, the fastest in six quarters, reflecting higher industrial output, improved capacity utilisation, and resilient demand. This compares to 7.7% in Q1 and just 2.2% in the same quarter of the previous fiscal. Industry as a whole grew 7.7%, supported by robust construction activity (7.2% growth). Mining was the only laggard, contracting due to monsoon disruptions. Services Sector Continues Dominance The services sector expanded by over 9% for the second consecutive quarter, led by: Financial, Real Estate & Professional Services: 10.2% Public Administration, Defence & Other Services: 9.7% These components played a pivotal role in pushing overall GDP beyond forecasts. Agriculture Shows Mild Improvement Agriculture GVA grew 3.5%, supported by stable food inflation and better kharif output, though still lower than industry and services contributions. Consumption and Investment Trends Private Consumption Strengthens Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) grew 7.9%, up from 7% in Q1, driven by: Lower food inflation GST rationalisation Moderation in interest rates Improvement in rural demand Economists highlighted that lower inflation boosted discretionary spending, reinforcing consumption-led growth. Investment Activity Supported by Capex Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) grew 7.3%, aided by: A 31% rise in government capital expenditure Early signs of revival in private investment Stronger credit flow to the industry Economists noted, however, that private investment remains sensitive to global risks, especially higher U.S. tariffs. Fiscal and Nominal Growth Concerns Despite strong real growth, India\u2019s nominal GDP growth slipped to 8.7%, a four-quarter low. Economists warned that low nominal growth could strain fiscal math, as tax revenues rose only 4% in the first seven months of FY26. To meet the budget target of 12.5% gross tax revenue growth, revenues must grow 22.3% in the remaining months of FY26, an ambitious requirement. Revised Growth Outlook The Chief Economic Advisor revised India\u2019s FY26 GDP growth projection to at least 7%, up from 6.3-6.8% previously. The RBI may also revise its 6.8% projection upward as the Q2 figure far exceeded expectations, especially ahead of the Monetary Policy Committee\u2019s meeting. However, economists expect growth to moderate to 6.1% in the second half of FY26 due to normalisation of capital expenditure and global headwinds. Macroeconomic Implications Monetary Policy With retail inflation at 0.25% in October, the lowest on record, the RBI was widely expected to initiate a rate cut. The strong GDP print may influence the central bank\u2019s rate trajectory, but does not diminish easing expectations.

The \u2018Impartiality\u2019 of a Nominated Governor Nov. 29, 2025 Context The renewed scrutiny of the role of Governors in India has brought attention back to the intentions of the framers of the Constitution and the divergence between those intentions and contemporary practices. As the Constitution was adopted on November 26, 1949 , the Constituent Assembly engaged in extensive debate to ensure that institutions such as the Governor\u2019s office operated within the spirit of parliamentary democracy . The evolving debate on the role of Governors highlights a clear divergence between constitutional intention and administrative practice. The Vision of the Constitution\u2019s Framers The Assembly voiced strong concerns about the impartiality and democratic legitimacy of a nominated Governor. Many feared that such an appointee, being selected by the Centre rather than elected by the people, could be susceptible to political influence, mirroring the colonial-era Governors under the Government of India Act, 1935 . The apprehension was that post-independence India might replicate the hierarchical power structures of the British Raj. Throughout these debates, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar clarified that the Governor was intended to be a purely constitutional Governor , required to act strictly on the advice of the Council of Ministers. He emphasised that the Governor\u2019s responsibility was to make the parliamentary system work , not to rival the elected Ministry. This design ensured that democratic authority remained solely with elected representatives, not with nominated functionaries. The Question of Discretion: Limited and Clearly Defined A major concern related to the Governor\u2019s discretionary powers . Members feared that granting any discretionary authority risked reintroducing the overriding powers of colonial Governors . Ambedkar responded categorically that the Constitution provided only a very limited discretion , applicable only in explicit circumstances such as choosing a Chief Minister when no party commands a clear majority. He repeatedly asserted that no power of discretion is to be inferred unless expressly provided. This principle was essential in ensuring that Governors could not unilaterally expand their authority through interpretation or convention. The office was meant to be restrained, predictable, and firmly subordinate to the democratic executive. The Debate on Withholding Assent to Bills The power to withhold assent or reserve Bills for the President also triggered significant debate. Critics argued that allowing a nominated Governor to impede legislation passed by an elected Assembly threatened the very basis of representative government. Leaders such as N.G. Ranga warned that permitting such control would be dangerous , as it placed elected legislatures at the mercy of an unelected figure. Ambedkar clarified that this power was not a discretionary veto but a procedural safeguard meant only for exceptional cases involving federal concerns or violations of constitutional principles . He stressed that the Governor was not a judge of legislative wisdom, stating that where the Constitution required action on ministerial advice, he must act on advice. His assurance that there was no ground for fear that the Governor will become a rival authority captured the framers\u2019 determination to uphold democratic supremacy. The Framers\u2019 Expectations and Changed Realities Ambedkar extended the principle of limited authority even to emergencies, asserting that Governors did not gain special powers and remained bound by ministerial advice. His confidence in the restrained nature of the office led him to remark that the role was so limited, so nominal, so ornamental that few would even desire it. In contrast, present-day political realities reveal a growing departure from this constitutional vision. In several States, Governors have been accused of delaying assent, withholding decisions, and engaging in political disagreements, challenging the norms of cooperative federalism . The constitutional requirement to act as soon as possible has, in some instances, been reinterpreted as \u2018 as late as possible\u2019, causing friction between State governments and the gubernatorial office. These developments echo K. R. Narayanan\u2019s profound question on the 50th anniversary of the Republic: \u201cHas the Constitution failed us, or have we failed the Constitution?\u201d The evidence suggests that constitutional function is compromised not by structural flaws but by individuals who disregard the ethical and moral responsibilities embedded in their offices. Conclusion The framers envisioned a Governor who was neutral, restrained, and bound by democratic accountability . Contemporary deviations do not reflect ambiguity in constitutional design but a failure to adhere to constitutional morality. Ambedkar\u2019s caution that if the system breaks down, Man was vile, remains a powerful reminder that democratic institutions rely not o", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}
{"id": "342251e7-7453-451a-a752-ca24990441d3", "text": "Home / Mains Articles / Presidential Opinion V... Presidential Opinion Versus the Federal Structure Nov. 27, 2025 Context In the political life of any nation, there are defining moments when institutions must act as guardians of foundational principles . India faces such a moment today. The recent Supreme Court opinion on the 16th Presidential reference concerning the powers of Governors and the President has reshaped the delicate federal compact envisioned by the Constitution. This shift risks transforming States into subordinate entities and accelerating the consolidation of power within the Union government, thereby striking at the heart of democratic governance. Federalism as the Backbone of India\u2019s Constitutional Design Federalism forms a core element of India\u2019s constitutional architecture. Although often described as quasi-federal , the constitutional scheme clearly distributes powers between the Union and the States, granting full autonomy to States in areas listed under the State List, such as law and order and land. The Union was envisioned as first among equals , not a superior political sovereign. This constitutional balance is endangered when State legislation can be indefinitely stalled or overridden by Governors and, in turn, by the President. When elected legislatures pass laws only to have them delayed, returned, or reserved without clear timelines, democratic will is subordinated to unelected functionaries. Such an arrangement undermines the equality of partners within the federation and reduces State autonomy to a mere formality. The Crisis of Gubernatorial Power The controversy centres on the undefined and unchecked powers exercised by Governors in withholding assent to bills. Allowing Governors, who are appointed by the Union government and often politically aligned with the ruling party at the Centre, to delay or obstruct legislation distorts democratic norms. Without constitutionally mandated timelines, their role effectively becomes that of an unelected veto-holder , capable of stalling laws indefinitely. Constitutional values of fairness, reasonableness, and non-arbitrariness require that all state action be bounded by clear limits. The absence of such limits for Governors contradicts the spirit of these principles. Judicial review , another element of the Constitution\u2019s basic structure, demands that all exercises of authority, including those of Governors and the President, be subject to scrutiny. Insulating their decisions or delays from judicial oversight erodes accountability and departs from long-standing constitutional doctrine. The Court\u2019s endorsement of a limited direction framework risks conferring vast discretionary power on Governors without adequate checks. Allowing important State legislation to be kept pending for extended periods creates a de facto pocket veto, leaving States vulnerable to political interference and forcing them into repeated litigation merely to secure constitutional compliance. A Pattern of Centralisation: Contextualising the Shift This dilution of federal principles gains deeper significance when viewed against broader patterns of centralisation in recent years. Multiple actions by the Union government have strained the federal equilibrium. First, the refusal to compensate producing States for GST losses undermined their fiscal stability. Second, the use of cess collections, whose proceeds the Centre is not obligated to share\u2014has effectively reduced the revenue available for devolution. Third, the Centre has failed to fully implement Finance Commission recommendations, weakening predictable fiscal transfers. Fourth , centrally sponsored schemes increasingly require States to contribute up to half the funding, placing heavy pressure on already-stressed State finances. Fifth, financial allocations have been used as political tools, with selective transfers tied to electoral or partisan considerations. Sixth, investigative agencies such as the CBI, ED, and Income Tax Department have been deployed in ways that destabilise Opposition-led State governments. Finally, increasing gubernatorial interference in legislative processes completes this pattern of central dominance. Together, these actions mark a profound distortion of the federal structure, risking a future in which the Union government wields unrestrained authority while States function as administrative outposts rather than sovereign constitutional units. Implications of Centralisation: Democracy at Stake The conflict between elected representatives and unelected authorities lies at the centre of the crisis. Allowing Governors or the President to override, delay, or neutralise the decisions of State Assemblies undermines democratic legitimacy. Federalism itself is a democratic safeguard: it disperses power to prevent centralised arbitrariness. When this safeguard weakens, the system becomes vulnerable to authoritarian tendencies.

Regulating User-Generated Content (UGC) - SC Pushes for Robust Framework to Balance Free Speech and Protection Nov. 28, 2025 Why in News? The Supreme Court of India expressed serious concern over the rapid spread of harmful User-Generated Content ( UGC ) on social media, including obscene, perverse, defamatory and allegedly \u201canti-national\u201d content. The Court examined the need for autonomous regulation, age-verification mechanisms, preventive measures, and amendments to the IT (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules/ IT Rules 2021 while ensuring compliance with Article 19(1)(a) and Article 19(2) . What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Key Developments Proposed Regulatory Measures Key Concerns Raised Way Forward Conclusion Key Developments: SC\u2019s observations: UGC with adult content, defamatory material or harmful misinformation goes viral before takedowns are possible. Existing warnings before adult content are insufficient. Users can run their own channels without accountability \u2014 termed as \u201cvery strange\u201d by the Chief Justice of India (CJI). Need for an impartial and autonomous authority , independent of government and private broadcasters. Protection vs free speech: The court clarified the intention not to curb free speech, but to protect innocents from irreversible harm. Emphasised that misuse of online speech undermines the rights of vulnerable individuals. Proposed Regulatory Measures: Preventive mechanisms for online content: Age verification : Suggested use of Aadhaar or PAN for age verification before accessing sensitive content. Stricter oversight : Autonomous body to regulate UGC \u2014 \u201cself-styled bodies will not be effective.\u201d AI - enabled moderation : Platforms must leverage AI for impact assessment, early detection, and prompt moderation. Amendments proposed by the Ministry of I&B: Expansion of the IT Rules, 2021 : Incorporation of guidelines on obscenity standards, AI and deepfake regulation, accessibility norms, rating of content by age group, bar on anti-national digital content. Definition of \u201cobscene content\u201d : Based on lascivious character, prurient interest, and potential to \"deprave or corrupt\" the audience. Digital content must not: Offend decency, attack religions/communities, promote communal attitudes Be obscene, defamatory, false or contain suggestive innuendos Promote violence, anti-national attitudes, criminality Derogate women or PwDs Present indecent or vulgar themes Violate Cinematograph Act, 1952 Include live coverage of anti-terror operations outside official briefings Community standards test : Use of Aveek Sarkar judgment (contemporary community standards). Content rating framework: U (can be viewed by a person under the age of 7 years with parental guidance), U/A 7+, U/A 13+, U/A 16+, A (online curated content which is restricted to adults). Key Concerns Raised: Risk of pre-censorship : Senior Advocate Amit Sibal warned that the term \u201cpreventive\u201d may imply \u201cpre-censorship.\u201d Suggested replacing it with \u201c effective \u201d regulation. Ambiguity in \u2018anti-national\u2019 definition: Advocate Prashant Bhushan expressed concerns over broad and vague use of the term. Need for public consultations : Prior SC directions mandating consultations with stakeholders not yet followed. Pre-legislative consultation policy (2014) requires open public debate on such rules. Other concerns: Rapid virality of content before takedown. Lack of pre-emptive protection for victims. Borderless nature of social media communication. Difficulty balancing free speech with protection against harm. Children\u2019s vulnerability to unfiltered online content. Confusion among platforms due to legal overlaps and pending challenges to IT Rules, 2021. Way Forward: Establish autonomous digital content authority: Independent of both State and private intermediaries. Implement secure age verification: Explore Aadhaar/PAN integration with strong privacy protections. Strengthen IT Rules, 2021 : Clear standards for obscenity, deepfakes, community harm, and discrimination. Mandate public consultations: In line with the 2014 Pre-Legislative Consultation Policy. AI-driven early detection systems : Mandatory deployment for content risk assessment. Clear definition of key terms : Especially \u201canti-national,\u201d \u201cperverse content,\u201d \u201cobscene digital content\u201d. Enhanced platform accountability : Strict penalties for non-compliance, modelled on SC/ST Act safeguarding principles. Conclusion: The Supreme Court\u2019s intervention marks a critical step in India\u2019s evolving digital governance landscape. While reaffirming the sanctity of freedom of speech under Article 19(1)(a), the Court emphasises the urgent need for preventive, accountable and technologically updated mechanisms to safeguard citizens from harmful UGC.

Poshan Tracker - Addressing Myths, Strengthening Digital Accountability Nov. 26, 2025 Context: The Poshan Tracker \u2014 launched by the Ministry of Women and Child Development in 2021 \u2014 has recently entered public debate due to misconceptions surrounding e-KYC and Facial Recognition System (FRS). e-KYC and FRS are used for monitoring Take-Home Ration (THR) delivery under the Integrated Child Development Services ( ICDS ). The article clarifies myths, highlights technological safeguards, and outlines the need for improved awareness and usability . Background - What is the Poshan Tracker?: The Poshan Tracker is an application under Mission Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 and is the primary tool for POSHAN Abhiyaan . It is one of the world\u2019s largest government-funded nutrition monitoring systems used to monitor the delivery of nutrition services under the umbrella of the ICDS scheme. It covers 1.4 million Anganwadi Centres and monitors over 88 million beneficiaries (women, children and adolescent girls). It is designed to ensure transparency, accountability, real-time monitoring and reduce leakage in food and nutrition delivery. Why e-KYC and FRS Were Introduced?: Persistent ground-level challenges: Duplicate or \u201cghost\u201d beneficiaries. Diversion and leakage of THR. Shortfalls in quantity or quality of rations. Need for proof-based delivery and real-time tracking. How e-KYC works: The Anganwadi worker enters the Aadhaar number, an OTP is sent to the registered mobile number, and once verified, the beneficiary is marked as e-KYC verified on the Poshan Tracker. How facial recognition works?: Anganwadi worker captures a live photo at the time of THR distribution. The system matches the photo with the registration or e-KYC photo. Ensures ration reaches the rightful recipient , and records delivery digitally. Myths vs Facts: Myth vs fact 1: e-KYC needs to be done every month. The fact is that it is a one-time verification process. Once verified, the beneficiary is permanently marked as \u201ce-KYC verified\u201d. Myth vs fact 2: Even small children must undergo facial recognition. The Poshan Tracker does not undertake facial authentication of children under six years for delivery of THR. It verifies the child\u2019s identity through the parent or guardian, usually the mother. Myth vs fact 3: FRS for THR distribution cannot function offline, and concerns about the lack of internet connectivity in rural areas. Face matching works in both online and offline modes, with the offline option specifically developed for low-connectivity areas. Myth vs fact 4: Personal data and photographs are stored locally. Data flows through encrypted channels, no local storage of photos or identifiers, backend servers remain secured. Myth vs fact 5: Beneficiaries need smartphones for FRS. Only the Anganwadi worker uses the smartphone, beneficiaries do not need one. Achievements and Scale: As of August 2025, nearly 3.69 crore THR beneficiaries (out of 4.9 crore registered), representing about 75% of the target base \u2014 had completed e-KYC and facial authentication. This reflects India\u2019s remarkable readiness to embrace digital tools at scale and its growing confidence in technology-driven public service delivery. Challenges Identified: Digital misconceptions and misinformation among citizens and frontline workers. Usability issues in the app; time burden on Anganwadi workers during THR distribution. Connectivity gaps in remote rural areas (though offline mode exists). Need for improved digital literacy among Anganwadi workers. Ensuring constant adherence to data privacy norms. Way Forward: Strengthen public communication to counter myths and misinformation. Conduct usability testing to improve app efficiency and reduce workload. Streamline service delivery workflows to save time during THR distribution. Invest in capacity building, training, and digital literacy of Anganwadi workers. Maintain robust data protection and encryption standards to build public trust. Encourage community awareness to ensure smooth authentication processes. Conclusion: The Poshan Tracker represents a landmark initiative in India\u2019s digital governance and nutrition service delivery, aiming to ensure that every beneficiary receives their rightful entitlements. While misconceptions around e-KYC and FRS exist, the system is backed by strong security protocols and has already achieved significant coverage . Addressing myths will be crucial to realising its full potential in strengthening nutrition governance , transparency, and accountability in India.

Supreme Court Questions Govt on Failure to Prevent Custodial Torture Nov. 26, 2025 Why in news? The Supreme Court criticised the Union government for not responding to its five-year-old directive to install CCTV cameras in all police stations and central agency offices such as the CBI, ED and NIA. Only 11 States/UTs submitted compliance reports; the Centre did not. The Bench expressed shock that custodial torture continues unabated, citing 11 custodial deaths in Rajasthan within eight months. The judges observed that custodial brutality persists despite earlier judicial orders. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Custodial Torture in India: A Persisting Human Rights Crisis Supreme Court Pulls Up Centre for Ignoring CCTV Directions Custodial Torture in India: A Persisting Human Rights Crisis Custodial torture in India is a widespread and systemic human rights violation involving physical and psychological abuse of individuals in police or judicial custody. Despite the high number of custodial deaths each year, conviction rates remain extremely low, reflecting deep-rooted impunity and weak accountability mechanisms within the system. Prisoners\u2019 dignity and fundamental rights are protected under international law. The UN Charter (1945) emphasizes humane treatment, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) safeguards individuals from torture, cruel treatment, and enforced disappearances, ensuring security and dignity. Scale of the Problem Custodial torture\u2014both physical and psychological\u2014remains widespread and systemic. NHRC reported 2,739 custodial deaths in 2024, up from 2,400 in 2023. Marginalised groups\u2014Dalits, Adivasis, Muslims, daily-wage earners\u2014are disproportionately targeted. Accountability is abysmal: Zero convictions in 345 judicial inquiries (2017\u20132022) despite arrests and charge sheets. Why Custodial Torture Persists? Absence of Specific Anti-Torture Law - India lacks a dedicated legislation criminalising torture as per global standards. Although India signed UN Convention Against Torture (UNCAT, 1997), it has not ratified it. Culture of Impunity - Police personnel often shield each other, discouraging accountability. Systemic misuse of coercive interrogation methods remains widespread. Systemic and Institutional Failures - Overworked police forces, inadequate training in non-coercive techniques. Weak prison infrastructure and insufficient oversight mechanisms. Weak Legal Protection for Victims - Fear of retaliation and lack of legal aid prevent victims from reporting abuse. Legal & Judicial Safeguards Article 14: Ensures that all individuals are treated equally, reinforcing that law enforcement agencies are not above the law. Article 21 : Right to life includes protection from torture. Article 20(1): Prohibits conviction for acts that were not offences when committed and guards against excessive or arbitrary punitive actions. Article 20(3): Protection against self-incrimination. D.K. Basu Guidelines (1997): Mandate arrest memo, medical exam, identification of police officers, etc. New Criminal Laws Section 120, Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) - Criminalises causing hurt or grievous hurt to extract confessions or information through violence or coercion. Section 35, Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) - Requires that all arrests and detentions follow legally valid, clearly documented procedures. Section 22, Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam (BSA) - Declares confessions obtained under inducement, threat, coercion, or promise as legally inadmissible. Supreme Court Pulls Up Centre for Ignoring CCTV Directions The Supreme Court expressed displeasure that only 11 States/UTs had filed compliance affidavits regarding the installation of functional CCTVs in police stations. The Union government had not filed its response either. Background: The 2020 Nariman Judgment In Paramvir Singh Saini vs Baljit Singh (2020), the Supreme Court mandated CCTV installation in police stations and offices of all agencies with arrest and interrogation powers \u2014 including the NIA, CBI, ED, NCB, DRI, and SFIO. This was ordered to safeguard fundamental rights and deter custodial torture. Debate on CCTVs and Security Concerns The Centre argued that CCTV installation outside police stations could be counter-productive, citing security concerns. The court disagreed, referring to live-streamed police stations in the U.S. and the need for more open correctional facilities to reduce overcrowding.

The Kamalesan Case and Its Simple Lesson Nov. 28, 2025 Context Lieutenant Samuel Kamalesan\u2019s dismissal from the Indian Army for refusing to enter the sanctum of his regiment\u2019s temple or gurdwara during ritual worship presents a clash between individual conscience and institutional cohesion . The Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court upheld the Army\u2019s decision, interpreting his refusal as disobedience of a lawful command rather than an exercise of religious freedom. Their reasoning rested on military necessity , discipline, and the constitutional authority under Article 33 , which allows the restriction of fundamental rights for the armed forces. When Restraint Becomes Silence While judicial deference to military expertise is common, it is not absolute. The courts have previously reshaped military norms in cases involving women officers, recruitment, pensions, and promotion policies when equality demanded intervention. The question here was modest: whether a sincere religious objection could be accommodated without weakening discipline . The principle from Bijoe Emmanuel, that respectful dissent need not be punished, offered a constitutional framework. A proportionality test could have examined whether compelling entry into the sanctum was essential to cohesion. The judiciary chose restraint, but restraint left the deeper dilemma unresolved. The Army\u2019s Ethos and the Fragility of Trust Ritual as Unity The Army argued that participation in ceremonial practices enhances morale, trust, and troop bonding , especially in fixed-class regiments where officers must be fully accepted by the soldiers they lead into combat. Rituals, though rooted in faith, function as secular instruments of cohesion . Kamalesan\u2019s refusal, however respectful, was seen as distancing. This interpretation guided the disciplinary action. An Institution Proud of Inclusivity The Army\u2019s record of religious diversity and equal opportunity is longstanding. From UN missions to disaster relief, it has integrated soldiers of all faiths. The prominence of Colonel Sofiya Qureshi during Operation Sindoor exemplifies its efforts to highlight women and officers from varied backgrounds. This tradition of inclusivity makes the Kamalesan episode particularly unsettling, for it suggests a moment when an institution known for flexibility chose rigidity instead . A Modest Request, A Missed Opportunity Kamalesan attended the parades, followed all customs, removed his shoes, tied the turban, and stood with his troops. His single request was not to enter the sanctum during active worship , a line many Protestant Christians cannot cross. This was a chance for the Army to employ its characteristic pragmatism. The example of Eric Liddell in Chariots of Fire, whose Olympic team reshuffled events to honour his belief, shows how institutions can bend without breaking. A small accommodation would have preserved both discipline and dignity . The Costs: Personal, Institutional, and Symbolic More Than a Lost Officer The dismissal cost the Army more than one career. It risks sending an unintended signal to minority soldiers that sincere conscience-based boundaries may carry no institutional weight , even when expressed respectfully. India\u2019s military unity has never rested on majoritarian comfort but on deep interfaith trust forged in war and counterinsurgency. Any perception that religious lines may be crossed under compulsion threatens that trust. Messages Beyond Intention Neither the courts nor the Army may have intended exclusion, but institutional messages do not depend solely on intention. In diverse militaries, perception shapes morale as much as policy. A feeling of vulnerability among minority soldiers, even slight, can erode the confidence that underpins cohesion. Leadership, Rigidity, and the Drift of Institutions Avoiding the Path of Prejudice While not equivalent to the Dreyfus affair, this episode carries a cautionary note. Strong institutions can drift toward rigidity one small step at a time, mistaking uniformity for unity. Victor Hugo\u2019s warning that armies lose strength when they lose their sense of justice remains relevant. The Indian Army\u2019s credibility rests on rising above religious and political divides. Any shift toward coercive uniformity risks diminishing that credibility. A Failure of Command, Not of Commitment The troubling aspect is not the legal judgment but that the issue reached a courtroom at all . A matter solvable by empathetic leadership and a single directive hardened into a disciplinary conflict. The Army has long balanced tradition with modernity and authority with fairness ; here, that balance slipped. Conclusion When duty meets conscience, the challenge is not choosing between them but enabling them to coexist . A small accommodation would have reinforced the principle that every soldier, of every faith, stands equal in uniform .

Inside Airbus\u2019s Mass A320 Recall: The Fault, the Fix, and the Fallout Nov. 30, 2025 Why in news? Airlines worldwide are rushing to apply a mandatory Airbus fix for a software vulnerability affecting thousands of A320 -family aircraft. Airbus found that intense solar radiation could corrupt flight-control data in the aircraft\u2019s elevator aileron computer (ELAC), posing a potential safety risk. Of the more than 11,000 A320-series jets in service globally, over half may be impacted\u2014making this the largest recall in Airbus\u2019s history. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? How the Airbus A320 Software Vulnerability Came to Light? How Airlines Implemented Airbus\u2019s Fix for the A320 ELAC Vulnerability? How the Airbus A320 Software Vulnerability Came to Light? Airbus revealed that a major software vulnerability had been discovered after an incident involving an A320-family aircraft. This prompted an urgent requirement for software updates\u2014and in some cases hardware changes\u2014across thousands of aircraft globally, including over 300 in India. Solar Radiation Identified as Root Cause Airbus stated that analysis of a recent event showed intense solar radiation could corrupt critical flight-control data in the Elevator Aileron Computer (ELAC). Solar radiation is the radiant energy emitted by the sun, traveling through space as electromagnetic waves. This energy includes visible light, infrared radiation (heat), and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. This malware-like corruption risk made a large portion of the in-service fleet vulnerable. Immediate Regulatory Intervention Soon after Airbus issued an Alert Operators Transmission (AOT), the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) released an Emergency Airworthiness Directive requiring airlines to implement the fixes \u201cbefore next flight.\u201d EASA confirmed that the vulnerability was detected after an A320 experienced an uncommanded, brief pitch-down, causing a momentary loss of altitude without any pilot input. Why ELAC Was at the Center of the Issue? The ELAC is a key computer that helps the pilots control the plane. It takes the pilots\u2019 joystick (sidestick) movements and moves the parts on the wings and tail \u2014 which make the plane go up, down, or turn. Basically, ELAC is a primary flight-control computer. A specific combination of ELAC hardware and software was found to be susceptible to radiation-induced data corruption , creating a risk of uncommanded elevator movement that could, in the worst case, exceed the aircraft\u2019s structural capability. The Incident That Exposed the Flaw While EASA did not name the aircraft, industry insiders report that the event involved a JetBlue flight from Cancun to Newark on October 30. The aircraft suffered an unexpected altitude drop, injuring some passengers. This incident triggered the technical investigation that uncovered the ELAC vulnerability. How Airlines Implemented Airbus\u2019s Fix for the A320 ELAC Vulnerability? Airbus prescribed an immediate rectification for affected A320-family aircraft. For most jets, the solution was a quick software rollback \u2014reverting to an earlier version of the ELAC software. Experts note this update takes around two hours. However, a smaller group of older A320 variants may require complete ELAC hardware replacement, which takes longer and depends on unit availability. Progress in India: Majority Fixed by Saturday Evening According to the DGCA, nearly 80% of affected Indian aircraft had already undergone the software change. Out of 338 A320-family aircraft identified across IndiGo, Air India, and Air India Express: 270 aircraft were fully rectified by 5:30 pm 68 aircraft were expected to be completed later the same day Impact on Airline Operations Despite concerns of large-scale disruption, the fix caused only minor delays and rescheduling, not widespread cancellations. Officials reiterated that passengers need not panic, as operational impact remained modest. A320-family jets operate multiple rotations per day, meaning even brief ground time for updates can cause cascading delays. Still, airlines managed to avoid significant cancellations.

PM-SHRI Schools Row: Understanding the Scheme and Kerala\u2019s Opposition Oct. 28, 2025 Why in news? The PM-SHRI schools scheme has sparked a fresh political controversy in Kerala , as the CPI(M)-led LDF government reversed its earlier stance and agreed to implement the scheme by signing an MoU with the Centre. The move has faced criticism from both the opposition and within the LDF itself, with the CPI objecting that it was not consulted and reminding that the Left had previously opposed the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 , under which the scheme operates. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? PM-SHRI Schools: Model Institutions for Implementing NEP 2020 States Implementing the PM-SHRI Scheme Conditions for Implementing the PM-SHRI Scheme PM-SHRI Schools: Model Institutions for Implementing NEP 2020 Approved in 2022, the PM Schools for Rising India (PM-SHRI) scheme aims to develop 14,500 schools across the country as model institutions showcasing the core principles of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. So far, 13,070 schools have been selected, including 1,533 Kendriya Vidyalayas and Navodaya Vidyalayas. The scheme covers existing government and local body schools at the elementary, secondary, and senior secondary levels. These schools are expected to adopt innovative learning methods such as art-based and toy-based learning, introduce vocational education, and establish skill labs. They must ensure foundational literacy and numeracy, zero dropouts, and improved learning outcomes . Curriculum will follow either the National Curriculum Framework (NCF) or the State Curriculum Framework (SCF) aligned with NEP 2020. Schools will be assessed through a School Quality Assessment Framework, with funding linked to their performance. The scheme follows a 60:40 funding ratio between the Centre and states, aiming to transform schools into exemplars of modern, inclusive, and competency-based education. States Implementing the PM-SHRI Scheme With Kerala now agreeing to join, most Indian states have come on board with the PM Schools for Rising India (PM-SHRI) scheme. Congress-ruled states such as Karnataka, Telangana, and Himachal Pradesh have implemented the scheme, along with AAP-ruled Punjab and Delhi, which had earlier relented after the Education Ministry stopped Samagra Shiksha funds. States Opposing the Scheme Only Tamil Nadu and West Bengal continue to hold out. West Bengal objects to prefixing \u201cPM-SHRI\u201d to school names despite sharing project costs. Tamil Nadu opposes the scheme because it implies adopting the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 \u201cin entirety.\u201d Conditions for Implementing the PM-SHRI Scheme The implementation of the PM-SHRI scheme is closely linked to the Centre\u2019s Samagra Shiksha programme, which shares the same 60:40 funding ratio between the Centre and states. Link Between PM-SHRI and Samagra Shiksha Funding The Centre has made PM-SHRI participation a condition for the release of Samagra Shiksha funds, which support key education initiatives such as: Implementation of the Right to Education Act (RTE), Provision of uniforms and textbooks for government school students, Support for children with disabilities, and Reimbursements to private schools for EWS admissions. States that refused to implement PM-SHRI \u2014 including Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal \u2014 did not receive Samagra Shiksha funds. Kerala\u2019s Funding Shortfall Kerala has received no central funds for Samagra Shiksha in 2024-25 and 2025-26, and only a partial allocation in 2023-24, amounting to about \u20b91,150 crore. The state has used its own share of funds to cover essential expenses like RTE entitlements, textbooks, and salaries, but scholarships, uniforms, and school grants remain pending. Signing the MoU and NEP Clause To access funds, Kerala recently signed an MoU with the Centre, which requires states to implement the NEP 2020 in entirety . However, Kerala\u2019s General Education Minister clarified that the state will adopt only selective provisions of NEP, retaining control over its curriculum and textbooks while complying with central funding norms.

Winding Up the Clock of India-Nepal Economic Ties Oct. 27, 2025 Context On October 1, 2025, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra announced a set of measures aimed at internationalising the Indian rupee (INR). While these initiatives have broad regional implications, they hold special promise for strengthening the economic relationship between India and Nepal. The new RBI policies, allowing authorised dealer (AD) banks to lend rupees to non-residents, permitting Special Rupee Vostro Accounts (SRVAs) to invest in corporate instruments , and establishing transparent reference rates for major currencies, signal a deepening of financial and trade cooperation. For Nepal, these developments could mean easier access to credit, stronger trade integration, and a potential transformation in its macroeconomic resilience. The RBI\u2019s Measures: Pathways to Integration The first measure allows AD banks in India to extend rupee-denominated loans to non-residents from Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka for cross-border trade. This reform addresses a long-standing gap in institutional credit, particularly for industries engaged in India\u2013Nepal trade. The second measure expands the scope of Special Rupee Vostro Accounts to include investments in corporate bonds and commercial papers , thus enhancing cross-border capital flows. The third initiative, establishing a transparent reference rate for major currencies , introduces predictability and reduces exchange rate volatility, making INR-based transactions more efficient and reliable. Collectively, these steps not only promote the rupee\u2019s international role but also facilitate smoother trade settlements and stronger financial cooperation between India and its neighbours, particularly Nepal. Nepal\u2019s Domestic Constraints and the Credit Challenge Despite steady remittance inflows, Nepal continues to face structural weaknesses in its economy. After a partial recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, its industrial performance remained stagnant due to a lack of business confidence and restricted access to credit. Nepalese banks, often controlled by large industrial houses, have been conservative in lending to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This has resulted in credit bottlenecks, weak supply chains , and limited employment opportunities, fuelling economic instability and political unrest. By allowing Indian banks to lend directly in INR, the RBI\u2019s policy provides alternative credit channels for Nepalese enterprises. Access to competitively priced loans could encourage industrial expansion, improve liquidity, and boost participation in cross-border trade, thus offsetting Nepal\u2019s domestic financial rigidity. The Dynamics of India\u2013Nepal Trade The India\u2013Nepal economic relationship is defined by deep interdependence. India accounts for nearly 65% of Nepal\u2019s international trade, with exports from India exceeding $8 billion and imports from Nepal around $1 billion. Indian firms remain major investors in Nepal, contributing 33% of total FDI worth approximately $670 million. Despite the asymmetry, the partnership serves as a vital economic lifeline for Nepal, offering market access, investment capital, and technological linkages. The exchange rate peg of 1.6 Nepalese rupees (NPR) to 1 Indian rupee has provided monetary stability and shielded Nepal from sharp currency depreciations. Maintaining this peg, while enabling new credit and investment avenues, reinforces macroeconomic confidence and trade-led growth. Thus, the RBI\u2019s measures can deepen financial interlinkages without disturbing the existing monetary equilibrium. Strategic and Economic Multiplier Effects Beyond trade, the RBI\u2019s measures have strategic implications . Increasing the use of INR in Nepal\u2019s transactions will reduce dependency on the U.S. dollar and mitigate exposure to global currency volatility. This can ease pressure on foreign exchange reserves, narrow the Current Account Deficit (CAD ), and enhance financial stability. A robust INR\u2013NPR financial ecosystem may also promote joint ventures , industrial clustering, and value-added processing for export-oriented growth. From India\u2019s standpoint, these steps align with its ambition to make the rupee a regional trade currency, thereby strengthening India\u2019s financial influence and economic diplomacy amid a changing global monetary landscape. The Way Forward: Implementation and Institutional Coordination The success of these policies depends on institutional cooperation. The Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) must interpret, adapt, and implement the RBI\u2019s framework while safeguarding Nepal\u2019s monetary interests. Developing compliance mechanisms, risk assessment protocols, and prudential norms will be essential for effective adoption. Collaboration on sovereign guarantees, Letters of Credit, and country risk ratings will help institutionalise bilateral trust.

A Quip That Stings but Also Inspires Oct. 29, 2025 Context The 2025 Nobel Prize in Economics , awarded to Joel Mokyr , Philippe Aghion , and Peter Howitt , marks a turning point in the understanding of innovation, growth, and history . At its heart lies a quiet irony: while modern economics celebrates data and precision, the enduring foundations of progress are built through historical understanding and institutional learning . Mokyr\u2019s quip that economic historians don\u2019t win the prize exposes a deeper truth, prosperity depends less on mathematical models than on the social machinery that carries knowledge, develops experimentation, and restrains privilege. Growth, in this view, is a social technology before it is a mechanical one. The Social Foundations of Growth Modern prosperity emerged not from a single invention or genius, but from civic institutions that enabled useful knowledge to travel . Coffeehouses, printing presses, guilds, dissenting congregations, and learned societies formed the networks through which ideas circulated and recombined. Apprenticeships, shop-floor heuristics, and rule-of-thumb engineering created a shared code of practical know-how. Where markets were contestable and cities porous , these networks incubated capability. Where institutions ossified, they blocked entry and throttled innovation . Schumpeter\u2019s creative destruction operates only when this social infrastructure allows new ideas to challenge entrenched power. Economic growth, therefore, depends as much on the openness of civic life as on the brilliance of invention. Dynamic Innovation and Institutional Design The work of Aghion and Howitt gives formal shape to this historical reality. Their Schumpeterian growth framework shows how innovation rents attract entrepreneurs , how incumbents defend their positions through lobbying or litigation , and how policy choices decide whether competition fuels progress or stifles it . Innovation thrives when experimentation is cheap and entry easy , and it falters when institutions harden into monopolies . Together, Mokyr, Aghion, and Howitt reveal that innovation is sustained not by privilege but by process . The vitality of an economy lies in protecting the engine of experimentation , not the owners of the last engine. Economic History as a Living Laboratory Economic history offers the long view needed to understand how societies learn, adapt, and institutionalize progress. Its archives reveal incentives and behaviours that cannot be captured by regressions or identification strategies alone. Douglass North and Robert Fogel demonstrated that institutions and counterfactual reasoning belong at the core of economics. Claudia Goldin\u2019s work traced how historical patterns of women\u2019s labour participation shaped modern markets. Simon Kuznets\u2019 national accounts were inseparable from the historical measurement of economies . Economic history, far from being a sideshow, is the laboratory where culture, rules, and technology interact . It illuminates how societies build the frameworks that turn invention into sustained prosperity. Modern Challenges Through a Historical Lens AI and jobs Technology shocks do not simply destroy employment; they reprice skills and reorganize tasks . The critical issue is transition management , determining who bears the cost of adaptation. Policies that ensure portable benefits , skills bridges , interoperable systems , and data portability protect workers and entry , not incumbents. Public debt The Dutch and British states achieved credibility not through austerity but through institutional capacity , reliable taxation, representative government , and enforceable contracts . Fiscal sustainability is institutional, not arithmetic. Inequality History exposes how guilds defended privilege under the guise of quality control . True reform lies in contestability, lowering barriers so that capability, not pedigree , determines success. In the digital age, open standards, pro-competitive procurement, and limits on self-preferencing echo the role once played by coffeehouses and cheap pamphlets in spreading opportunity. Technology, Time, and the Caution of History Nick Crafts\u2019 reinterpretation of the British Industrial Revolution shows that general-purpose technologies , steam, ICT, AI, appear late in productivity data because they demand complementary investments and institutional adaptation . Jared Diamond\u2019s broader lens reminds us that technology unfolds within geographical and ecological constraints . Economic history tempers euphoria with realism and despair with patience , revealing that progress is cumulative, uneven, and deeply embedded in its social context. Conclusion Recognition often arrives late, both for prizes and productivity, yet what endures is not acclaim but the machinery of openness that keeps innovation alive. Prosperity is the exception, not the norm. It survives only where societies argue productively", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

India\u2019s Pulses Push: Driving Aatmanirbharta in Food Security Oct. 28, 2025 Why in news? The Ministry of Agriculture has issued operational guidelines to launch the Mission for Aatmanirbharta in Pulses from the current rabi season , aiming to boost domestic pulses production and reduce import dependence . What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article?

Implementation Strategy of the Pulses Mission Mission for Aatmanirbharta in Pulses: India\u2019s 6-Year Plan for Self-Reliance Launched by PM Modi on October 11, and first announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Union Budget 2025-26, the Mission for Aatmanirbharta in Pulses aims to make India self-sufficient in pulse production. The six-year mission (2025-26 to 2030-31) has a total outlay of \u20b911,440 crore. Its key focus areas include: Developing and promoting climate-resilient, high-protein pulse varieties, Enhancing productivity and expanding the area under pulses, Improving post-harvest storage and management, and Ensuring fair and remunerative prices for farmers. By 2030-31, the mission targets: a 45% rise in production \u2014 from 242 lakh metric tonnes in 2023-24 to 350 lakh metric tonnes; a 13% expansion in area (from 275 to 310 lakh hectares) and a 28% boost in yield (from 881 kg/ha to 1,130 kg/ha). Current Status of Pulses Cultivation and Production in India During 2023-24, pulses were cultivated over 275 lakh hectares across India. Rajasthan had the largest share with 54.67 lakh hectares, followed by Madhya Pradesh (51 lakh ha), Maharashtra (44 lakh ha), and Uttar Pradesh (30 lakh ha). In terms of production , Madhya Pradesh led with 59.74 lakh metric tonnes, followed by Maharashtra (40 lakh MT), Rajasthan (33 lakh MT), and Uttar Pradesh (31 lakh MT), together contributing a major share of the total 242 lakh metric tonnes produced nationwide. Nearly half of the total cultivated area and over 60% of production occur during the rabi season. Among crops, gram (chana) dominates both in area and output, mainly grown in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. Moong ranks second , largely cultivated in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, followed by tur (arhar) grown in Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh. Urad is mainly produced in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Maharashtra, while masoor (lentil) is concentrated in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. Significance of the Mission for Aatmanirbharta in Pulses India is both the world\u2019s largest producer and consumer of pulses , yet domestic output falls short of demand. Therefore, India is forced to rely on imports from Myanmar, Mozambique, Tanzania, Australia, and Canada \u2014 a trend that has grown in recent years. According to NITI Aayog\u2019s report, India\u2019s pulses demand is projected to reach 268 lakh metric tonnes by 2030 and 293 lakh metric tonnes by 2047 . To bridge this gap, boosting domestic production is essential. Currently, India\u2019s average yield (881 kg/hectare) lags far behind Canada (2,200 kg/ha) and China (1,815 kg/ha). The mission, therefore, seeks to raise productivity to 1,130 kg/hectare, making India self-reliant in pulses and reducing import dependence. Focus on Tur, Urad, and Masoor in the Pulses Mission The Mission for Aatmanirbharta in Pulses prioritises tur (arhar), urad, and masoor (lentil) as these three crops together account for about 34% of India\u2019s total pulses area and make a major contribution to national production. However, a large yield gap persists in these crops, which the mission aims to close through targeted interventions. Out of the proposed 35 lakh hectare expansion, about 9 lakh hectares will be added for tur, mainly in Karnataka, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, and Jharkhand, along with new cultivation in the Northeast. Urad cultivation will expand by using rice fallow lands in Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, and Maharashtra, while masoor will be promoted in rice fallows of West Bengal, Bihar, and Chhattisgarh. How the New Pulses Mission Differs from the Earlier NFSNM Scheme? The Mission for Aatmanirbharta in Pulses replaces and expands upon the pulses component of the National Food Security and Nutrition Mission (NFSNM), introducing broader interventions and stronger farmer support. Under the new framework, assistance for Front Line Demonstrations (FLDs) has been increased to \u20b910,000 per hectare, up from \u20b99,000 earlier, to promote advanced agricultural technologies. A key change is the provision for 100% procurement of tur, urad, and masoor by NAFED and NCCF under the Price Support Scheme (PSS) of PM-AASHA for the next four years.

An Amended Constitution Bill, Its Contentious Issues Oct. 30, 2025 Context The Constitution (One Hundred and Thirtieth Amendment) Bill marks a pivotal step in India\u2019s effort to strengthen constitutional morality and political accountability . The Bill seeks to amend Articles 75, 164, and 239AA to mandate the removal of Ministers , including the Prime Minister and Chief Ministers , if they remain in custody for thirty consecutive days for an offence punishable with five years or more of imprisonment . While the proposal aims to uphold the integrity of public office , it has provoked widespread debate. The Provisions of the Bill Under the Bill, a Minister\u2019s arrest and detention for thirty consecutive days would compel the President or Governor to remove them from office on the advice of the Prime Minister or Chief Minister . If the Prime Minister or Chief Minister themselves are detained, they must resign or automatically cease to hold office . The measure seeks to prevent accused Ministers from retaining power , thus reinforcing public trust in governance . Yet, its reliance on arrest and custody duration as criteria for disqualification raises serious constitutional and procedural concerns , given the potential for abuse of discretionary powers by enforcement agencies. The Discretionary Power of Arrest The power to arrest, under Section 41 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and its counterpart Section 35 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) , is discretionary , not mandatory. Courts have consistently reaffirmed this position: In Joginder Kumar v. State of U.P. (1994) , the Supreme Court held that no arrest should be made merely because it is lawful ; it must be necessary and justified . In Deenan v. Jayalalitha (1989) and Amarawati and Anr. v. State of U.P. (2004) , courts clarified that the term may arrest empowers but does not oblige the police to arrest, depending on the nature and context of the offence . The Contentious Provisions: Detention, Bail, and the Problem of Thirty Days The Bail Dilemma The requirement that a Minister detained for thirty consecutive days must vacate office links political tenure to judicial timelines . Though the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that bail is the rule, jail is the exception , in practice, bail decisions are influenced by factors like the gravity of the offence and the judge\u2019s stance on liberty under Article 21 . This means a Minister could lose office before any judicial determination of guilt , contradicting the presumption of innocence . The thirty-day threshold therefore risks turning temporary detention into permanent political damage . Default Bail and Procedural Inconsistency The amendment also ignores default bail under Section 167(2) CrPC (or Section 187 BNSS ), which grants bail if the investigation is not completed within 60 or 90 days . Since the thirty-day limit falls well within this period, a Minister might be removed from office before acquiring the right to bail , rendering the provision procedurally inconsistent and arbitrary . Special Statutes and Twin Conditions of Bail The Bill\u2019s scope covers offences under any law in force , extending to stringent statutes such as the PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) , NDPS Act , and UAPA (Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act) . These impose twin conditions for bail , the accused must prove they are not guilty and unlikely to reoffend . Such provisions reverse the burden of proof , making bail within thirty days nearly impossible. The Manish Sisodia case , where bail was granted only after 17 months under the PMLA , exemplifies this difficulty. Consequently, the thirty-day benchmark could cause premature disqualification even before due judicial process concludes. Political Implications and the Risk of Misuse Arrest as a Political Tool By linking ministerial survival to arrest and custody , the Bill risks converting the criminal process into a political instrument . In a context where investigative agencies are often accused of bias , such provisions may facilitate targeted arrests against political rivals. This undermines the principle of separation of powers and constitutional morality , replacing accountability with political expediency . What is designed to enhance integrity could instead erode democratic fairness . The Minister\u2019s Dilemma The Bill also places Ministers in a Hobson\u2019s choice : Either resign to secure bail , thereby surrendering office pre-emptively, or Stay in custody and face automatic removal . This dilemma creates administrative instability and penalises mere accusation , rather than proven guilt. It risks reducing executive authority to the outcome of legal tactics , not democratic mandate. Conclusion The Constitution (One Hundred and Thirtieth Amendment) Bill reflects a well-meaning yet flawed attempt to promote ethical governance .

India\u2019s Diaspora Diplomacy: Balancing Pride and Restraint Abroad Oct. 29, 2025 Why in news? In recent weeks, the Indian diaspora has drawn global attention for religious and cultural displays that, in some cases, have crossed local norms in developed countries. Incidents such as Ganapati idol immersion in public water bodies and Deepavali fireworks in residential areas have sparked controversy. In Edmonton, Canada, fireworks set two houses on fire, leading police to warn, \u201cLight up your home, not your neighbour\u2019s roof.\u201d Meanwhile, in Australia, anti-immigrant protesters have targeted Indians, while in the U.S. and Canada, nationalist groups have increasingly focused on the Indian community, reflecting a rising tension between cultural expression and local sensitivities abroad . What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Diaspora Diplomacy and Soft Power Cultural Assertion and the Evolution of India\u2019s Diaspora Policy India\u2019s Approach to Overseas Citizenship Diaspora Diplomacy and Soft Power India has become the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy with a GDP of USD 4.19 trillion, supported significantly by its 35 million\u2013strong diaspora. Comprising NRIs and OCIs, the diaspora contributes through remittances exceeding USD 100 billion annually, investments, and social initiatives like village development. From ancient traders and indentured labourers to today\u2019s skilled professionals , Indian migration has evolved over centuries. Once criticized as a brain drain , it is now viewed as \u201cbrain gain,\u201d symbolizing India\u2019s global strength. India\u2019s diaspora enhances soft power through culture, technology, and advocacy , influencing major outcomes like the U.S.\u2013India nuclear deal . However, lobbying successes vary with host-country politics and diaspora unity. Cultural Assertion and the Evolution of India\u2019s Diaspora Policy A growing section of the Indian diaspora is displaying assertive cultural nationalism , promoting practices like Deepavali firecrackers abroad as symbols of community pride and identity. Simultaneously, some groups are urging the diaspora to advocate India\u2019s political positions, especially in the United States. Historically, however, Jawaharlal Nehru maintained a clear distinction between India and its overseas communities. While the freedom movement had global links, Nehru insisted that post-Independence India stay out of PIO politics. He urged persons of Indian origin (PIOs) to remain loyal to their adopted countries, avoiding any perception of Indian interference in foreign domestic affairs. From Territorial to Cultural Nationalism In the early decades after Independence, India\u2019s foreign policy and diaspora engagement were guided by territorial nationalism, not cultural identity . Issues like discrimination and racism were framed as universal human rights concerns, reflecting India\u2019s commitment to global justice rather than ethnic solidarity. Rise of Global Cultural Nationalism From the 1990s onward, the increasing Indian migration created a global network of cultural nationalists. This trend gained strong momentum after Narendra Modi became Prime Minister in 2014, marked by large-scale diaspora rallies abroad, particularly in the United States. Growing Western Sensitivity to Foreign Influence At the same time, Western nations \u2014 notably the U.S., Canada, Australia, and parts of Europe \u2014 became increasingly wary of foreign interference in domestic politics. Allegations of Chinese and Russian influence sharpened this sensitivity , even as Israel\u2019s lobbying began facing bipartisan criticism in the U.S. Although foreign influence operations are legal in the U.S. if transparently registered, the state-backed mobilisation of the Indian diaspora has drawn quiet scrutiny . India\u2019s Position in the Changing Landscape Historically seen as a benign and diverse immigrant community, Indian Americans now face growing attention as India\u2019s outreach to its diaspora becomes more overtly strategic. While India has avoided the hostility directed at Russia or China, there are increasing signs of Western unease over efforts to align diaspora networks with New Delhi\u2019s political and cultural agenda . India\u2019s Approach to Overseas Citizenship India does not permit dual citizenship, but in 2003, it introduced Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) status through amendments to the Citizenship Act, 1955. This provided Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) with lifetime visa-free entry, exemption from police registration, and rights similar to NRIs in education, property, and business. In 2015, the government merged the PIO and OCI categories, describing the arrangement as \u201cdual citizenship in spirit, but not in law. \u201d In contrast, the United States allows dual citizenship , but growing concerns about foreign political influence have prompted calls for stricter scrutiny. Analysts have voiced concerns about divided loyalties and potential foreign interference.

NITI Aayog Report Highlights Rising Role of India\u2019s Service Sector Oct. 29, 2025 Why in the News? India\u2019s services sector is in the news after NITI Aayog released two comprehensive reports highlighting that the sector now contributes 55% to India\u2019s GVA and nearly 30% to total employment. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? India\u2019s Service Sector (Background, Statistics, etc.) NITI Aayog Report on Service Sector (Key Highlights, Policy Priorities, etc.) India\u2019s Service Sector: Driving Jobs and Growth in a Transforming Economy India\u2019s service sector has emerged as the core pillar of its economic transformation , shaping the country\u2019s journey from an agrarian economy to a knowledge and innovation-driven one. Encompassing a wide range of industries, including information technology, financial services, communications, education, healthcare, transport, tourism, and retail , the sector not only drives GDP but also represents India\u2019s global competitiveness. The sector\u2019s contribution to India\u2019s Gross Value Added (GVA) has steadily risen over the years, while its employment potential has expanded across both traditional and modern sub-sectors. India is today the 7 th largest exporter of services in the world , with a share of over 4% in global services exports . Key Highlights and Insights from the NITI Aayog Reports Employment Growth and Rising Share in Workforce According to the latest twin reports released by NITI Aayog , \u201cIndia\u2019s Services Sector: Insights from Employment Trends and State-Level Dynamics\u201d and \u201cIndia\u2019s Services Sector: Insights from GVA Trends and State-Level Dynamics\u201d, between 2017-18 and 2023-24 , India\u2019s service sector added nearly 40 million new jobs , raising its employment share from 26.9% in 2011-12 to 29.7% in 2023\u201324 . This means almost one in three Indian workers is now engaged in the services economy. The report also notes an improvement in employment elasticity , which rose from 0.35 pre-pandemic to 0.63 post-pandemic, indicating that job creation is increasingly responding to output growth. The sector\u2019s ability to absorb labour displaced from agriculture and low-productivity industry makes it a crucial driver of inclusive growth. Contribution to GDP and Economic Stability The services sector\u2019s contribution to India\u2019s Gross Value Added (GVA) increased from 49% in 2011-12 to 55% in 2023-24 , outpacing the secondary and primary sectors. It also recorded a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of about 7% , showing consistent resilience even during economic downturns. Sub-sectors such as Information Technology (IT), financial and professional services, communication, and logistics have been the key growth engines. For instance, Computer and Information Services GVA increased nearly fourfold , from Rs. 2.4 trillion in 2011\u201312 to 10.8 trillion in 2023\u201324 , highlighting India\u2019s digital dominance and the rapid expansion of knowledge-based services. Traditional vs Modern Services While traditional services such as trade, repair, and transport continue to employ a large section of the population, modern services like IT, finance, R&D, and consulting have seen faster growth and higher productivity levels. The Professional, Scientific, and Business Services segment alone contributes about 20% of total services output , underlining the importance of high-skilled and innovation-driven activities. Conversely, postal, courier, and insurance services remain underperforming and require modernisation and digital transformation. Regional Trends and State-Level Dynamics The NITI Aayog\u2019s state-level analysis reveals significant disparities in the development and composition of the services sector across India. Leaders: Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, and Kerala dominate the modern service economy, driven by IT, finance, and professional consulting. Together, they account for 40% of total services output . Lagging States: Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Odisha remain concentrated in low-value traditional services, with limited participation in high-value segments. Emerging Catch-Up: Encouragingly, lower-income states are showing \u201cbeta convergence\u201d , meaning they are growing faster in services GVA, narrowing the regional gap over time. NITI Aayog recommends a \u201cBuild\u2013Embed\u2013Scale\u201d framework to strengthen state-specific service ecosystems: Build - Invest in physical and digital infrastructure. Embed - Link services with industrial and skill ecosystems. Scale - Promote innovation and decentralised service delivery. Linkages with Income, Exports, and Digitalisation The correlation between a state\u2019s service sector strength and its per capita income is strong; states with higher service contributions, like Karnataka and Telangana, record higher incomes. At the macro level, India\u2019s services sector has become the largest recipient of FDI and a key contributor to foreign exchange earnings .

The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) is set to launch India\u2019s first-ever National Household Income Survey to collect reliable data on household income distribution across the country. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? NHIS (Introduction, Background & Need, Challenges, Strategy, Framework, Significance, etc.) First National Household Income Survey MoSPI is preparing to launch the country\u2019s first-ever National Household Income Survey (NHIS) in February 2026 , a landmark initiative to gather comprehensive income data from Indian households. The survey aims to fill a critical information gap in India\u2019s economic landscape by providing a reliable estimate of income distribution, data that has long been missing from the country\u2019s statistical system. According to MoSPI , the NHIS will be one of the \u201ctoughest\u201d surveys ever conducted by the ministry due to the sensitive nature of the data being collected. The results of the survey are expected to be available by mid-2027 . Background and Need for the Survey While India regularly conducts large-scale surveys on consumption, employment, and household expenditure , there has never been a successful nationwide effort to measure household income . Earlier attempts, dating back to the 1950s, failed because the income data collected were often inconsistent, in many cases showing household income to be lower than the sum of consumption and savings. The absence of reliable income data has long hindered evidence-based policymaking . Policymakers have had to rely on consumption data as a proxy for income distribution, which often masks the true extent of income inequality, underemployment, and informal sector earnings . Recognising this gap, MoSPI had earlier announced that the income survey was \u201cvital\u201d to understanding structural changes in India\u2019s economy over the past 75 years , particularly the shifts from agriculture to services and the rise of informal work. Challenges in Conducting Income Surveys Income surveys are considered among the most complex and sensitive statistical exercises worldwide , owing to respondents\u2019 reluctance to disclose accurate information about their earnings. According to MoSPI\u2019s pre-survey testing conducted in August 2025, 95% of respondents found income-related questions \u201csensitive\u201d and were uncomfortable disclosing income details from different sources. Most also refused to answer questions related to taxes paid . This hesitation stems from cultural and psychological barriers, concerns about privacy, and fear of disclosure to tax authorities. To address this, MoSPI has emphasised public awareness, transparency, and anonymity assurances as critical factors for the survey\u2019s success. Pre-Survey Findings and Strategy The pre-survey testing of the NHIS questionnaire revealed that: 73% of respondents found the questionnaire relevant. 84% had a partial-to-good understanding of the survey\u2019s purpose. 95% considered income-related data \u201csensitive\u201d and required assurance of confidentiality. To overcome these challenges, MoSPI will conduct an extensive communication campaign to inform households about the survey\u2019s objectives and the strict anonymity protocols. Field staff will be trained to build rapport with households , clarify misconceptions, and assure respondents that the data will be used solely for statistical purposes. At the operational level, MoSPI will develop a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for surveyors to ensure uniformity, accuracy, and privacy protection during data collection. Institutional Framework and Expert Oversight The ministry has established a Technical Expert Group (TEG) chaired by Surjit S. Bhalla , former Executive Director of India at the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The TEG will guide the survey\u2019s methodology, oversee implementation, and provide recommendations on the presentation and release of results. The MoSPI would take a decision on the final release of results only after the expert group\u2019s review to ensure data credibility. This cautious approach follows the controversy surrounding the non-release of the 2017-18 Consumer Expenditure Survey , which was withheld due to data quality concerns. Significance of the Survey The NHIS will provide critical insights into income inequality, taxation patterns, and the structure of household earnings across urban and rural India. The data will help policymakers design more effective welfare schemes, social security programmes, and fiscal redistribution policies . It will also support India\u2019s efforts to align with global statistical standards such as those set by the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA) and the OECD \u2019s Guidelines for Income and Wealth Distribution . By capturing detailed information on sources of income, including wages, self-employment, agriculture, remittances, and government transfers, the NHIS will enable a mor", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

China\u2019s WTO Complaint Against India\u2019s PLI Scheme Oct. 30, 2025 Why in the News? China has filed a formal complaint against India at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) , alleging that India\u2019s Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes for batteries, automobiles, and electric vehicles violate global trade rules by favouring domestic products. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? India\u2019s PLI Scheme (Background, Understanding PLI Scheme, China\u2019s Allegations, WTO Rules on Subsidies, India\u2019s Defence, Broader Implications, etc.) China\u2019s WTO Complaint Against India\u2019s PLI Scheme China has formally filed a complaint with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) against India, alleging that several of India\u2019s Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes violate global trade rules. Beijing claims that these schemes, aimed at promoting the manufacturing of advanced chemistry cell (ACC) batteries , automobiles , and electric vehicles (EVs) , provide subsidies contingent on the use of domestic goods , thereby discriminating against imported products, including those from China. This dispute marks one of the most significant trade confrontations between India and China within the WTO framework in recent years, highlighting the broader tension between industrial policy ambitions and international trade rules . Understanding the PLI Scheme Launched in 2020 , India\u2019s PLI scheme is a flagship initiative designed to strengthen domestic manufacturing, attract global investment, and integrate India into global value chains (GVCs) . The scheme provides financial incentives to companies based on incremental sales of goods manufactured in India, aiming to make domestic industries globally competitive while fostering innovation and employment generation. The three PLI schemes challenged by China are: PLI for Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Batteries: Encourages giga-scale battery manufacturing for EVs and energy storage systems. PLI for the Automobile and Auto Components Sector: Promotes the development of Advanced Automotive Technology (AAT) products, including EV components. PLI for the Electric Vehicle (EV) Ecosystem: Aims to attract major global EV manufacturers and reduce import dependence. China\u2019s Allegations Against India China\u2019s central argument rests on the claim that these PLIs amount to prohibited subsidies under the WTO\u2019s Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM) Agreement . Beijing contends that: The PLI schemes are \u201cImport Substitution (IS) subsidies\u201d , as they encourage companies to use domestically produced goods over imported ones. For example, the PLI for the auto sector mandates a 50% Domestic Value Addition (DVA) requirement, while the ACC battery scheme stipulates a 25% DVA threshold for eligibility. These conditions, China argues, discriminate against foreign inputs and are inconsistent with WTO rules that prohibit subsidies contingent upon the use of domestic over imported goods. China maintains that such subsidies distort market competition and hinder its exports to India, particularly in sectors like EV batteries and automotive components, where Chinese manufacturers are global leaders. WTO Rules on Subsidies and Trade Measures Under WTO law, countries have the sovereign right to provide subsidies for industrial development. However, the SCM Agreement ensures that such subsidies do not cause unfair trade distortions . Classification of Subsidies under WTO Law Prohibited Subsidies: Those contingent upon export performance or on the use of domestic goods over imported goods. Actionable Subsidies: Permitted subsidies that may still be challenged if they cause adverse effects on other WTO members. Non-Actionable Subsidies: Subsidies for legitimate public objectives such as R&D or environmental protection (currently lapsed). Import substitution (IS) subsidies fall under the prohibited category , as outlined in Article 3.1(b) of the SCM Agreement. Additionally, India\u2019s PLI schemes may also be examined under: Article III.4 of GATT (National Treatment Principle): Prohibits countries from treating imported goods less favourably than domestic goods. Article 2.1 of the Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMs) Agreement: Prohibits investment measures that are inconsistent with national treatment obligations, such as local content requirements. However, experts point out that India\u2019s PLI schemes link incentives to value addition , not necessarily to the use of domestic goods. Value addition can occur through innovation, local assembly, or supply chain integration, making China\u2019s claims legally complex and open to interpretation . India\u2019s Likely Defence Non-Contingency on Local Content: The Domestic Value Addition (DVA) benchmarks do not explicitly mandate the use of Indian goods; instead, they assess value creation within India , which can include imported components that undergo processing or transformation.

Reimagining Indian Cities as Economic Growth Hubs for a Viksit Bharat Oct. 29, 2025 Context: India\u2019s goal of becoming a $30 trillion economy by 2047 and achieving net zero by 2070 places cities at the center of its development trajectory. Urban areas must evolve not just as centers of habitation but as engines of economic growth, sustainability, and resilience. Urbanisation and the Developmental Imperative: Cities as growth engines : Most job creation and industrial expansion will occur in cities, and they are crucial for harnessing India\u2019s demographic dividend . Climate commitments : Cities contribute significantly to GHG emissions and thus must lead in achieving net-zero and low-emission development . Vulnerability and resilience : High population densities make cities especially prone to disasters and pandemics, necessitating enhanced urban resilience . Legacy of Urban Planning in India: Historical roots : India\u2019s planning systems originated in the mid-1800s, primarily as a public health response to the plague. Current limitations: Focused narrowly on land-use planning rather than economic vision. Master Plans lack integration with long-term economic, climate, and resource goals. Growth projections are based on past population trends , not future job potential or economic expansion. Need for an Economic Vision in Urban Planning: Economic vision first : Urban planning should begin with identifying key economic drivers for the next 20\u201350 years. Integrated framework: Assessments of population growt h based on the number of jobs that are likely to be created. This will provide a basis for determining the infrastructure needs and land requirements for different purposes. In the absence of such an exercise, land-use plans lack a credible basis. Outcome : Transition from passive population-based planning to dynamic growth-based planning. Natural Resource and Environmental Planning: Resource budgeting : Cities must conduct natural resource budgeting to assess carrying capacity and manage water, land, and energy sustainably. Demand management : Emphasis on efficient resource use and limiting urban expansion within ecological boundaries. Climate action plans : Every city should adopt a climate action roadmap for low-emission growth and resilience to extreme weather events. Tackling Urban Pollution and Mobility Challenges: Air pollution crisis : Plans must include environmental management, especially for air quality improvement. Transport reforms : Development of Comprehensive Mobility Plans (CMPs) promoting - Public transport systems Non-motorised transport (NMT) like cycling and walking Reduced dependence on private vehicles Regional and Tier-II City Integration: Beyond municipal boundaries : Urban economic planning should encompass peri-urban and regional linkages. Rural-urban synergy : Recognize economic interdependence between cities and surrounding rural areas. Smaller cities\u2019 role : Affordable land and emerging industries make Tier-II and Tier-III cities vital for manufacturing and inclusive urbanisation. Institutional and Educational Reforms Needed: Planning laws : Amend outdated urban planning regulations to integrate economic, environmental, and regional perspectives. Urban education : Reform urban planning curricula to build professionals skilled in economic geography, climate adaptation, and sustainability. Way Forward: Reorient urban planning from land-use centric to economy-driven, sustainable frameworks. Develop city-specific climate and resource management plans. Foster regional planning that includes smaller cities and their linkages. Align urban policy with Viksit Bharat 2047 goals and net-zero commitments. Invest in capacity building and institutional reforms for adaptive urban governance. Conclusion: India\u2019s current urban planning paradigm\u2014rooted in colonial-era sanitation concerns\u2014must evolve to meet 21st-century challenges. The future demands cities that are economically vibrant, resource-efficient, and climate-resilient. Transforming cities into \u201c economic growth hubs \u201d is not just a planning reform; it is an essential pillar for realizing the vision of a Viksit Bharat.

The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation ( MoSPI ) has proposed key methodological reforms in the Consumer Price Index ( CPI ), specifically in the compilation of the housing index . These reforms aim to make inflation measurement more accurate , representative, and transparent, reflecting post-pandemic changes in rental markets and including rural housing data for the first time. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Background - CPI and Housing Index Proposed Methodological Changes Inclusion of Rural Sector through HCES 2023-24 Transparency and Consultation Process Way Forward Conclusion Background - CPI and Housing Index: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is India\u2019s main measure of retail inflation . The MoSPI is revising the CPI base year to 2024 from 2012 , with item weights based on the 2023-24 Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) . Currently, housing data is collected biannually and only for urban areas. The weight of housing in the CPI basket is 21.67% for urban areas and 10.07% at the all-India level. According to data released last month, housing inflation accelerated to 3.98% in September from 3.09% in August. Overall, India's retail inflation eased to 1.5% from 2.1% over the same period. Economists have long criticized the inclusion of employer-provided dwellings and use of House Rent Allowance (HRA) as a rent proxy. Proposed Methodological Changes: Monthly rent data collection: Rent data will be collected monthly instead of every six months. Coverage expanded to both rural and urban areas , marking a major shift. The dwelling type weight will be based on Census 2011 . Exclusion of employer-provided housing: Government and employer-provided accommodations will be excluded to avoid distortions since they don\u2019t reflect market transactions. Expanded sample and IMF guidance: Rent data to be collected from all selected dwellings every month (earlier one-sixth sample). International Monetary Fund (IMF) technical experts recommended refining India\u2019s panel approach to improve representativeness. The revised formula ensures \u201c like-for-like \u201d comparison and avoids downward bias in rent index computation. Inclusion of Rural Sector through HCES 2023-24: The HCES 2023-24 has, for the first time, captured rural house rent and imputed rent for owner-occupied dwellings. This enables compilation of a rural housing index , absent in the HCES 2011-12 series. The new series will therefore represent comprehensive national housing dynamics . Transparency and Consultation Process: MoSPI released the third discussion paper as part of its base revision exercise of the CPI. Previous papers focused on \u2018Treatment of Free Public Distribution System (PDS) Items in CPI Compilation\u2019. The Ministry plans to hold data conferences and stakeholder consultations to enhance transparency and inclusiveness . Feedback on the housing index changes has been invited till November 20, 2025. Way Forward: The proposed CPI revision will align India\u2019s methodology with global statistical best practices. Continuous data collection from rural and urban areas will improve the robustness of inflation measurement. Exclusion of non-market housing will enhance accuracy in assessing true inflationary pressures. The exercise will also help policy-makers, RBI, and households better understand the impact of housing costs on inflation and real income . Conclusion: The overhaul of the housing index methodology marks a significant reform in India\u2019s CPI framework. By integrating monthly, all-India rent data and removing distortionary elements, MoSPI aims to create a more representative and credible inflation index. This reform is crucial in the context of post-pandemic rental surges, rural-urban housing disparity, and the need for data-driven economic policymaking in a rapidly evolving economy. newspaper.pdf ( Size: 685.6 KB ) Latest Article See All IndiGo Meltdown Dec. 5, 2025, 2:34 p.m. Economics India to Expand Its Busiest Rail Corridors: What\u2019s Planned Dec. 5, 2025, 2:08 p.m. Economics Census 2027 - Counting India, Renewing the Republic Dec. 5, 2025, 1:54 p.m. Editorial Analysis Health and National Security Cess on Demerit Goods Dec. 5, 2025, 1:48 p.m. Economics A Missing Link in India\u2019s Mineral Mission Dec. 5, 2025, 1:33 p.m. Editorial Analysis A Day to Pause and Come Down to Earth Dec. 5, 2025, 1:27 p.m. Editorial Analysis Rupee Breaches the 90-Mark Dec. 4, 2025, 1:36 p.m. Economics Putin\u2019s Visit: India\u2013Russia Ties and the Road Ahead Dec. 4, 2025, 1:24 p.m. International Relations Judiciary Flags Major Lapses in Critical Care for Acid Attack Survivors Dec. 4, 2025, 1:13 p.m. Polity & Governance India\u2019s Seven-Point Energy Transition Agenda for 2035 Dec. 4, 2025, 1:05 p.m. Editorial Analysis", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

A Start for North-South Carbon Market Cooperation Oct. 28, 2025 Context The European Union (EU) and India\u2019s New Strategic EU\u2013India Agenda , announced on September 17, 2025 , marks a significant milestone in their evolving partnership. Structured around five key pillars ; prosperity and sustainability , technology and innovation , security and defence , connectivity and global issues , and cross-cutting enablers , the agenda seeks to deepen collaboration across economic and geopolitical domains. Among its most consequential features lies a seemingly technical but transformative proposal : linking India\u2019s Carbon Market (ICM) with the EU\u2019s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) . The Promise of the Linkage and the Structural Weakness of India\u2019s Carbon Market The Promise of the Linkage At its core, the proposed linkage between the Indian Carbon Market and CBAM offers a pragmatic solution to a pressing challenge: the risk of double carbon penalties for Indian exporters. Under CBAM , the EU imposes a carbon levy on imports based on the embedded emissions in goods , ensuring a level playing field with domestic producers who already pay carbon prices under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) . By allowing carbon costs paid within India to be deducted from CBAM charges at the EU border, exporters would be spared the unfair burden of dual payments . This arrangement could incentivise early decarbonisation , align domestic emissions reductions with global trade competitiveness , and reflect a rare case of climate justice in practice , recognising rather than penalising developing country efforts in carbon pricing. The Structural Weakness of India\u2019s Carbon Market Yet this vision rests on a shaky institutional foundation . India\u2019s Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) , commonly called the Indian Carbon Market (ICM) , remains underdeveloped compared to the EU\u2019s mature ETS . While the EU ETS has a two-decade track record of auction mechanisms , strict emission caps , and independent verification , India\u2019s system is fragmented and experimental . Its current credits often rely on project-based offsets or efficiency improvements rather than binding absolute emission caps . For CBAM\u2019s tonne-for-tonne accounting to work credibly, the EU must trust that India\u2019s carbon credits represent verifiable emission reductions . However, the absence of strong regulators , transparent registries , and compliance enforcement undermines that trust. Unless India upgrades its carbon market to a compliance-grade mechanism with legal enforceability , the EU is unlikely to accept Indian carbon prices as valid deductions. The Carbon Price Gap and Political Economy Risks Even if institutional reforms succeed, a major price disparity The EU ETS carbon price fluctuates between \u20ac60 and \u20ac80 per tonne , while India\u2019s nascent market trades at \u20ac5 to \u20ac10 per tonne . Without price parity or alignment , EU regulators will deduct only minimal amounts , undermining the intended relief for exporters. This creates serious political and industrial risks in India. Exporters could face double burdens , paying both the domestic compliance cost and the full CBAM levy , leading to industrial resistance and pressure to dilute carbon rules . The resulting political economy tension , between industrial competitiveness and environmental ambition , is a central obstacle. Possible solutions such as sectoral carbon contracts or a negotiated carbon price floor are technically feasible but politically delicate , requiring long-term coordination between New Delhi and Brussels . The Geopolitical Contradictions of CBAM and the Way Forward The Geopolitical Contradictions of CBAM Beyond economics, the CBAM\u2013ICM linkage raises geopolitical and sovereignty concerns . India, along with other developing nations, has opposed CBAM at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and in international climate dialogues , labelling it unilateral and protectionist . By agreeing to integrate its carbon market with CBAM, India risks legitimising a mechanism it has formally resisted . This contradiction could trigger future disputes : if the EU deems India\u2019s carbon prices insufficient , exporters may face partial or full CBAM penalties , prompting political escalation or legal challenge . The Way Forward: Toward a Cooperative Future Despite its challenges, the CBAM\u2013ICM linkage holds transformative potential . If implemented successfully, it could become a global model for North\u2013South carbon market cooperation . It would protect Indian exporters , accelerate industrial decarbonisation , and strengthen EU\u2013India climate diplomacy . Achieving this outcome requires a phased and transparent approach , where India strengthens its market integrity and the EU provides technical and policy support . Only through collaborative design , clear equivalence criteria , and joint monitoring mechanisms can the two sides translate ambition into action.

India\u2019s financial landscape is undergoing a major transformation as global giants \u2014 from Emirates NBD, Blackstone, Zurich Insurance, SMBC, Abu Dhabi\u2019s IHC to Bain Capital \u2014 are acquiring significant stakes in Indian banks, insurers, and NBFCs. This marks a new phase of foreign capital infusion into a sector once considered over-regulated and closed, highlighting a strategic shift amid capital liberalisation. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Evolution of India\u2019s Financial Sector Recent Big-Ticket Investments Why Global Giants Are Investing Regulatory Approach and Market Valuation Post-Crisis Sector Cleanup Opportunities and Strategic Advantages Risks and Concerns Way Forward Conclusion Evolution of India\u2019s Financial Sector: From protectionism to liberalisation: Historically, India\u2019s financial sector was tightly regulated with limited foreign participation . Gradual policy reforms by the RBI and the government have allowed greater foreign ownership - Up to 100% in insurance companies. Up to 74% in private banks (with approval). Examples : Fairfax (Canada) was given special approval to hold a majority stake in CSB Bank for five years \u2014 a deviation from the 40% foreign cap, considering it a strategic revival investment. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) hold 48.39% stake in HDFC Bank , the second largest bank in the country. Recent Big-Ticket Investments: Blackstone Inc , the world\u2019s largest alternative asset manager, has acquired a minority stake of 9.99% in Federal Bank Ltd for Rs 6,196 crore. Bain Capital will be investing Rs 4,385 crore to acquire an 18.0% stake on a fully diluted basis via preferential allotment of equity and warrants in Manappuram Finance. Dubai-based Emirates NBD announced a $3 billion acquisition of a 60% stake in RBL Bank, making it one of the largest foreign takeovers in India\u2019s financial sector. Japan\u2019s SMBC acquired about 25% in Yes Bank, investing over $1.6 billion. Zurich Insurance bought a 70% majority stake in Kotak General Insurance for $670 million. Abu Dhabi\u2019s International Holding Company also entered the fray with a nearly $1 billion investment in Sammaan Capital (formerly Indiabulls Housing), an NBFC. These deals mark the largest wave of foreign takeovers in India\u2019s financial history. Why Global Giants Are Investing? Robust growth fundamentals: India\u2019s economy is growing at 6.8% (RBI estimate). The banking sector generated $46 billion net income (2024) with 31% YoY growth \u2014 higher than global average (McKinsey report). Credit growth is driven by small businesses, retail and housing sectors. Structural strengths: Low corporate leverage and focus on secured retail lending. India presents a vast, untapped and rapidly expanding financial market with over 400 million underbanked population , and a vast informal credit system. Digital infrastructure (UPI, Aadhaar, Jan Dhan) enables penetration and cost-efficient service delivery. Global context: Stagnation in developed markets (US, Europe). China\u2019s tightening regulations and geopolitical risks have diverted capital toward India. India offers scale, political stability, demographic advantage, and credible regulation. Regulatory Approach and Market Valuation: The RBI maintains a \u201c positive but cautious \u201d stance, ensuring fit-and-proper ownership and domestic control. Despite high performance, Indian banks remain undervalued \u2014 indicating market scepticism about long-term sustainability. The measured liberalisation of ownership ensures capital inflow while keeping regulatory sovereignty intact. Post-Crisis Sector Cleanup: Past decade challenges : IL&FS and DHFL collapse, Yes Bank rescue, and NBFC liquidity crisis. Reforms implemented: Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code ( IBC ) for resolution. RBI\u2019s supervisory tightening and bad-loan cleanup. Result : Mid-sized banks and NBFCs have become stable and attractive acquisition targets. Opportunities and Strategic Advantages: Global investors gain immediate access to licenses, branch networks, and customer bases \u2014 saving years of setup. For India, it brings foreign capital, innovation, and best practices in risk management and governance. Aids India\u2019s march toward becoming a $7 trillion economy by early 2030. Risks and Concerns: Financial sovereignty: Majority foreign ownership could shift strategic control offshore. Policy alignment during crises may not match domestic priorities. Exposure to global shocks: Rising global interest rates or liquidity tightening could lead to capital withdrawal, straining domestic credit flows. Lehman Brothers collapse (2008) serves as a reminder of global contagion risk. Competitive distortions: Foreign-owned entities may access cheaper global capital, disadvantaging domestic banks under tighter norms. Need for regulatory clarity: Larger and complex deals call for clearer frameworks on foreign control thresholds and compliance protocols.

Big Tech\u2019s Contempt for Indian Public Health Oct. 28, 2025 Context Drug advertising has been a matter of public concern in India since 1927 , when Sir Haroon Jaffer raised the issue of control of the craze for medicinal drugs in the Council of State . The concern eventually led to the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act (DMRA), 1954 , which prohibits advertisements for drugs claiming to cure or prevent a list of 54 diseases and medical conditions . The purpose of this law was to protect citizens from misleading claims and pseudo-medical treatments . However, the digital age has transformed the advertising landscape . The rise of social media , search engines , and online marketplaces has created an environment where the spirit of the DMRA is routinely violated. The Evolution of Drug Advertising: From Legislative Vigilance to Digital Evasion The DMRA was crafted at a time when government oversight could effectively target print and broadcast media . In the digital era , this model no longer holds. Online advertising operates across borders, managed by algorithms and corporations based outside India . As a result, unverified medical advertisements , especially those promoting \u201cayurvedic , homeopathic , or miracle\u201d cures , have multiplied on the Internet. Searches for products such as ayurveda blood pressure tablets or homeopathy diabetes cures routinely display paid promotions under sponsored tags . Many of these advertisements claim to treat serious conditions like diabetes and cancer , violating the DMRA\u2019s explicit prohibitions . The situation is made worse by promotional videos featuring spiritual figures who claim to cure all diseases using traditional medicine. Such practices have turned online platforms into powerful vehicles for misinformation that can endanger public health . Double Standards in Global Corporate Behaviour and Legal Evasion Double Standards in Global Corporate Behaviour A striking contrast exists between the conduct of technology companies in India and their behaviour in the United States . In the U.S., health-related advertisements are tightly controlled. Platforms employ pre-screening systems and adhere to detailed content guidelines to ensure compliance with laws enforced by agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) . False or unapproved therapeutic claims are swiftly removed, and violations invite criminal prosecution . In India, the same companies apply no such rigour . Their advertising policies make no mention of the DMRA or its prohibitions, enabling advertisers to promote unverified medical products . This double standard exposes a clear hierarchy in corporate compliance . Companies obey strong regulations in Western nations but neglect similar responsibilities in developing ones. Legal Evasion and Institutional Weakness Technology companies often justify their inaction by claiming intermediary status under Indian law, a designation that shields them from liability for user-generated content . Yet this argument collapses in the context of paid advertising . Advertisements are not user-generated; they are actively solicited, approved, and monetised by the platforms themselves. Contracts are signed, payments are accepted, and advertising slots are deliberately allocated. These are the actions of publishers , not passive intermediaries. Regulatory weakness compounds the problem. The Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed in 2008 over violations of the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act, 1994 (PNDT) offers a telling example. Accountability is further weakened by the legal separation between Indian subsidiaries and their U.S.-based parent companies . The Way Forward: Reclaiming Sovereignty through Reform Addressing these failures requires firm regulatory and legal reform . Criminal proceedings against responsible managerial personnel would mark a decisive step toward enforcement. Mandating that key decision-makers for advertising and content operations in India be citizens based in India would ensure accountability to domestic courts and laws. Such measures would align India\u2019s digital governance with its sovereign right to protect public health. Another necessary reform is the conditional revocation of intermediary immunity . Platforms that disregard laws like the DMRA should not benefit from the protections granted to neutral intermediaries. Immunity must be contingent on compliance with Indian law. Without this condition, the privilege becomes an instrument of impunity rather than innovation . Conclusion The history of India\u2019s struggle against misleading medical advertisements , beginning in 1927 and codified in 1954 , reveals a continuous tension between public welfare and commercial exploitation . The digital era has intensified this conflict, as foreign corporations exploit legal loopholes and weak enforcement to profit from misinformation ", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

Oct. 31, 2025 Why in news? India has consistently opposed unilateral economic sanctions , but has often complied with US-imposed restrictions to avoid fallout. In the past, Indian refiners stopped importing oil from Iran and Venezuela after the US sanctioned those countries. Now, with new US sanctions on Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil, a similar situation looms. India avoids dealing with sanctioned entities mainly due to the risk of US secondary sanctions , which could penalize third-party countries or companies doing business with the targeted nations. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Understanding Secondary Sanctions Why Countries Fear US Secondary Sanctions Why US Sanctions Matter for India Understanding Secondary Sanctions Secondary sanctions extend beyond the direct targets of US restrictions. Primary sanctions stop American citizens and companies from dealing with blacklisted entities (like Rosneft and Lukoil). On the other hand, secondary sanctions aim to discourage foreign countries and companies \u2014 over whom the US has no legal authority \u2014 from engaging with them. These measures act as \u201canti-circumvention tools\u201d, forcing other nations to comply indirectly by threatening penalties. Because they apply outside US borders, secondary sanctions are often seen as extraterritorial and questionable under international law . Why Countries Fear US Secondary Sanctions? The US dollar\u2019s dominance in global trade and the central role of the American financial system make US sanctions highly influential worldwide. Any company or country engaged in international trade needs access to US markets and banks \u2014 losing that access can cripple business. Secondary sanctions don\u2019t always impose fines ; instead, they block foreign entities from the US financial system if they act against Washington\u2019s foreign policy interests. Because of this, India\u2019s refiners and banks are expected to cut back on Russian oil imports, fearing penalties. The US Treasury\u2019s warning that secondary sanctions could hit buyers of Russian crude has already had an impact \u2014 experts predict an immediate drop in India\u2019s Russian oil imports, which currently account for over 35% of total imports. Why US Sanctions Matter for India? US sanctions carry real weight because they make banks, insurers, and investors cautious, cutting off access to funding and financial systems. Most Indian refiners \u2014 including Reliance Industries (RIL) and public sector companies \u2014 rely heavily on the US market, banking network, and technology partners. Losing that access would seriously impact their global operations. India\u2019s Heavy Exposure to the US RIL, which buys nearly half of India\u2019s Russian oil, has subsidiaries, partnerships, and investments in the US with firms like Google, Meta, and Intel . Public sector refiners also depend on dollar-based payments and the American banking system to buy crude oil, pay shippers, and insurers. Any disruption in US dollar transactions could severely hurt India\u2019s refining sector. Impact on Russian Oil Imports To avoid secondary sanctions , Indian refiners and banks are expected to act with extreme caution , likely leading to a sharp drop in Russian oil imports . Government-owned refiners are already reviewing compliance risks , and RIL has said it will fully follow government guidance . Some refiners may try to buy Russian oil through third-party traders not directly targeted by sanctions. However, experts warn this loophole may not last, as the US could extend sanctions to these intermediaries if it wants to curb Russian oil flows more effectively. India\u2019s Official Stand The Indian government has reiterated that it will buy oil from wherever it gets the best price , as long as the oil itself is not under sanctions . However, the new US restrictions on Rosneft and Lukoil \u2014 which supply over two-thirds of India\u2019s Russian oil \u2014 could seriously limit India\u2019s access to cheap Russian crude in the near term. newspaper.pdf ( Size: 771.6 KB ) Latest Article See All IndiGo Meltdown Dec. 5, 2025, 2:34 p.m. Economics India to Expand Its Busiest Rail Corridors: What\u2019s Planned Dec. 5, 2025, 2:08 p.m. Economics Census 2027 - Counting India, Renewing the Republic Dec. 5, 2025, 1:54 p.m. Editorial Analysis Health and National Security Cess on Demerit Goods Dec. 5, 2025, 1:48 p.m. Economics A Missing Link in India\u2019s Mineral Mission Dec. 5, 2025, 1:33 p.m. Editorial Analysis A Day to Pause and Come Down to Earth Dec. 5, 2025, 1:27 p.m. Editorial Analysis Rupee Breaches the 90-Mark Dec. 4, 2025, 1:36 p.m. Economics Putin\u2019s Visit: India\u2013Russia Ties and the Road Ahead Dec. 4, 2025, 1:24 p.m. International Relations Judiciary Flags Major Lapses in Critical Care for Acid Attack Survivors Dec. 4, 2025, 1:13 p.m. Polity & Governance India\u2019s Seven-Point Energy Transition Agenda for 2035 Dec. 4, 2025, 1:05 p.m. Editorial Analysis", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

Special Intensive Revision (SIR) - Election Commission Launches SIR of Electoral Rolls in 12 States and UTs Oct. 28, 2025 Why in News? The Election Commission of India (ECI) has initiated a Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in 12 states and Union Territories, covering 51 crore electors , to ensure the purity and accuracy of electoral rolls . This is the first nationwide SIR since 2002\u20132005 , aimed at eliminating duplicate, migrated, or ineligible entries and verifying voter eligibility. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Background and Significance Coverage and Implementation Operational Details Special Cases and Administrative Coordination Challenges and Controversies Way Forward Conclusion Background and Significance: Evolution of SIR: The ECI\u2019s order (June 2025) mandated all registered electors to fill new enumeration forms, while those added after the last intensive revision (2002\u20132005) must submit eligibility and citizenship-related documents. The first phase began in Bihar , where Assembly elections are due, serving as a pilot model for future nationwide implementation. Constitutional and legal basis: The ECI cites Article 326 of the Constitution \u2014 which restricts voting rights to Indian citizens aged 18 and above \u2014 to justify verifying eligibility (not citizenship cancellation). The process is governed by the Representation of the People Act, 1950 . This ensures free and fair elections , one of the basic features of the Constitution. Need for SIR: Political parties have repeatedly complained about the \u201cimpurity\u201d in electoral rolls due to - Migration and multiple registrations. Non-removal of deceased voters. Wrongful inclusion of non-citizens. The SIR had been conducted 8 times since 1951 and the last intensive revision was conducted between 2002\u20132005 , followed by only summary revisions. Coverage and Implementation: States and UTs involved: The SIR will be conducted in A&N Islands, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Kerala, Lakshadweep, MP, Puducherry, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, UP, and West Bengal. Key dates: Enumeration period : Begins November 4, 2025. Draft roll publication : December 9, 2025. Final roll publication : February 7, 2026. Excluded state: Assam is excluded due to ongoing NRC process and distinct Citizenship Act provisions. Operational Details: Enumeration process: 5.33 lakh Booth Level Officers (BLOs) to conduct house-to-house verification . All electors must submit enumeration forms by December 4 to remain on the draft roll. Eligibility proof required for those not traceable to 2002\u20132005 SIR rolls. Documents accepted: 13 types of documents , including Aadhaar and extracts from Bihar\u2019s SIR roll. Aadhaar to be used only for identity verification, not citizenship proof. Electors born after July 1, 1987 must submit proof of parents\u2019 eligibility. Special Cases and Administrative Coordination: Bihar\u2019s experience: Bihar\u2019s SIR concluded on September 30, 2025, with electors reducing by 6% (to 7.42 crore). No appeals were filed against Electoral Registration Officers\u2019 (ERO) decisions. This model will guide the second phase of SIR. State-specific considerations: Urban areas like Delhi and Chandigarh have low linkage with old rolls due to migration. Weather conditions and local body elections have also influenced state selection and timelines. Challenges and Controversies: Legal challenge: The Supreme Court is hearing petitions questioning - ECI\u2019s authority to verify citizenship of registered voters. The procedure adopted in Bihar\u2019s SIR. Political opposition: West Bengal CM termed it an \u201c NRC through the backdoor \u201d. However, ECI maintains that constitutional bodies will carry out their respective roles independently. Administrative : Tight timelines and document verification may burden BLOs and EROs. Social : Risk of disenfranchisement if citizens lack documentary proof. Way Forward: Transparency and technology : Use of the Voter Portal to help citizens trace old roll entries. Electoral integrity : Purified rolls could reduce bogus voting and increase public trust. Awareness campaigns: To ensure mass participation and timely documentation. Data synchronization : Integration of digital databases to prevent duplication. Periodic SIRs : Institutionalizing regular intensive revisions to maintain credibility. Stakeholder engagement: Institutionalised consultations with political parties, civil society, and local administration before rollout. Legal clarity: Seek SC guidance to define ECI\u2019s powers under Article 326 and the RPA, 1950. Document access facilitation: Simplify and digitise the process of submitting eligibility proofs, especially in rural and migrant-heavy areas. Phased implementation: Adopt Bihar\u2019s learnings for gradual state-by-state rollout instead of a single nationwide push. Conclusion: The SIR of electoral rolls marks a major administrative reform to restore public trust in the electoral process.

A recent study has highlighted the sharp decline in the use and literacy of the Dogri language in Jammu and Kashmir, raising concerns over the erosion of regional linguistic heritage despite its official recognition. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Dogri Language (Background, Cultural & Linguistic Significance, Causes Behind Decline, Revival Strategy, etc.) Preserving Dogri Language: Reviving India\u2019s Endangered Linguistic Heritage The Dogri language , once a vibrant symbol of Jammu\u2019s cultural identity, is now at a critical juncture. Despite being recognised as one of the 22 official languages of India and one of the five official languages of Jammu and Kashmir , the language is experiencing a gradual erosion from public life, particularly among the younger generation and urban populations. According to a recent study, the decline of Dogri reflects a broader global trend of linguistic homogenisation , where smaller regional and indigenous languages are disappearing under the dominance of global and national tongues. India, as per UNESCO\u2019s report , leads the world in the number of dialects at risk of extinction, having lost over 220 languages in the past five decades . The Cultural and Linguistic Significance of Dogri Dogri belongs to the Indo-Aryan branch of the Indo-European language family and is mainly spoken in the Jammu region of Jammu and Kashmir, parts of Himachal Pradesh, and by diaspora communities across North India. It is written in both Devanagari and Takri scripts , and is deeply embedded in the Dogra culture , expressed through its literature, folklore, crafts, and oral traditions. The inclusion of Dogri in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution in 2003 and its recognition under the Jammu and Kashmir Official Languages Act, 2020, marked significant milestones in its journey. However, linguistic recognition on paper has not translated into functional visibility. Dogri remains largely absent from school curricula, administrative communication, and media content . Causes Behind the Decline The decline of Dogri in Jammu and surrounding regions can be understood through three interlinked factors: policy neglect, generational disconnect, and urban influence . Policy Gaps and Limited Institutional Support Dogri received formal recognition much later than other regional languages such as Urdu and Hindi. This delay resulted in a lack of infrastructure for linguistic promotion , from teacher training to the development of textbooks and cultural programming. A survey conducted across 20 locations in the Jammu region revealed that 48% of respondents believed the government had failed to provide adequate support for Dogri\u2019s inclusion in education and public discourse. 43% said the language offered little economic relevance , which disincentivised younger generations from learning it. Generational Disconnect Dogri\u2019s decline is particularly visible across generations. Respondents above 60 years of age showed full proficiency in speaking and moderate reading and writing skills , while the 21-40 age group showed near-zero literacy in Dogri . Among those under 20 years of age, no proficiency in reading or writing Dogri was recorded, signalling a complete breakdown in intergenerational transmission . The Rural-Urban Divide The linguistic divide between rural and urban populations further compounds the issue. While 56% of rural respondents said they actively speak Dogri, only 45% of urban respondents reported the same. Writing proficiency was even lower, 15% in rural areas and merely 4% in urban settings . Broader Linguistic Context in India Dogri\u2019s decline is part of a wider linguistic crisis in India. The People\u2019s Linguistic Survey of India (PLSI) estimates that nearly half of India\u2019s 780 languages could vanish in the next 50 years if current trends persist. Factors such as migration, economic aspirations, and cultural homogenisation have weakened local linguistic ecosystems. Experts argue that the hegemony of English as the academic and aspirational language has pushed regional languages to the periphery. This has created a cultural paradox where multilingualism thrives superficially, but linguistic diversity weakens structurally . Revival Strategies and the Way Forward Reviving Dogri requires a multi-pronged cultural and policy approach that focuses on education, awareness, and community engagement. Integration into Education Dogri must be introduced at the primary and secondary education levels , ensuring that children develop early familiarity with the language. The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 already advocates the use of mother tongues as mediums of instruction , a provision that could benefit Dogri if implemented effectively in Jammu\u2019s schools. Digital and Media Promotion Dogri\u2019s visibility can be enhanced through digital archives, online courses, and media content in Dogri, including fi", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation ( MoSPI ) has announced plans to use data from the Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprises and the Periodic Labour Force Survey to develop a District Domestic Product (DDP) framework for more accurate, district-level economic estimation. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Statistical Ecosystem (ASUSE & PLFS Surveys, Purpose & Methodology for DDP, Significance of DDP, Challenges & Way Forward) MoSPI to Use ASUSE and PLFS Surveys for Accurate District Domestic Product Estimation The MoSPI has announced a significant step toward improving India\u2019s statistical architecture by integrating two major datasets to calculate the District Domestic Product: The Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprises (ASUSE) and The Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) This initiative aims to provide more accurate, district-level economic data and empower states to make evidence-based policy decisions. Context: Strengthening India\u2019s Statistical Ecosystem At present, India\u2019s national and state-level GDP data often fail to capture regional variations within districts. Most District Domestic Product (DDP) estimates rely on top-down allocation methods , proportionately distributing state GDP based on outdated demographic indicators like population. This approach has long been criticised by experts who highlighted that the current method results in \u201cnear-identical growth rates for districts,\u201d thus masking true inter-district disparities. Recognising this data gap, MoSPI announced that beginning January 2025 , the ministry will work with state governments to introduce a bottom-up estimation model using detailed datasets from ASUSE and PLFS. About ASUSE and PLFS Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprises (ASUSE) ASUSE captures detailed data on India\u2019s vast unincorporated non-agricultural sector , covering manufacturing, trade, and services enterprises , including households, micro, and small units. This survey provides insights into the economic and operational characteristics of establishments that often remain outside the formal sector\u2019s purview. Earlier released annually, ASUSE now provides quarterly data for enhanced frequency and granularity. It serves as a critical input for understanding local enterprise activity, investment, and value addition patterns. Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) PLFS is conducted by the National Statistical Office (NSO) to measure employment, unemployment, and labor market participation across rural and urban areas. The survey is now conducted monthly , capturing dynamic trends in workforce participation, earnings, and occupational structures. By combining ASUSE (enterprise data) and PLFS (labour data), the government aims to create a comprehensive database of district-level economic activities , bridging the enterprise and employment dimensions of local economies. Purpose and Methodology for Estimating DDP The integration of ASUSE and PLFS will allow policymakers to capture real economic activity at the district level rather than relying on extrapolated state averages. Key features of the initiative include: Bottom-up estimation: District-level data will be aggregated upward to form state and national accounts, reversing the current top-down allocation model. Dual-sector coverage: The approach accounts for both enterprise activity (ASUSE) and labour participation (PLFS), ensuring holistic measurement of economic output. Policy collaboration: MoSPI is working closely with state governments to align data collection frameworks with local administrative and planning needs. Inclusion of informal sector: Since unincorporated enterprises and household-level activities form a large share of India\u2019s economy, the new methodology ensures that informal sector output is adequately represented. Complementary Statistical Initiatives The effort to refine DDP estimation is part of MoSPI\u2019s broader agenda to modernise India\u2019s statistical system . Several related initiatives are underway: Annual Survey of Service Sector Enterprises (ASSSE): To be launched in January 2026 , this will capture the dynamics of incorporated services such as IT, financial services, and logistics. National Household Income Survey (NHIS): Scheduled for February 2026 , it aims to measure income distribution, wealth, and inequality, complementing consumption and employment data. Expanded data accessibility: MoSPI has identified over 250 datasets for improved public access, including data from GST , E-Vahan , and trade statistics , to enrich national accounts and research capacity. Significance of District Domestic Product (DDP) The DDP represents the gross value added (GVA) within a district\u2019s geographical boundaries. It serves as a microeconomic counterpart to the state\u2019s Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP).

Turning Urban Challenges into Opportunity - India\u2019s Path to Global Talent Retention and Economic Growth Oct. 27, 2025 Context: The recent decision by US President Donald Trump to impose a $1,00,000 fee on H-1B visa applicants risks discouraging global talent and innovation. This protectionist stance opens a strategic window for India to attract skilled professionals , innovators, and entrepreneurs back home \u2014 but only if Indian cities can offer world-class living and working conditions. The article underlines how urban transformation is essential for India\u2019s aspiration to become a $30 trillion economy by 2047 and a global innovation hub. US Policy and Its Global Implications: Trump\u2019s H-1B visa fee : The $1,00,000 levy raises costs for US companies, limiting access to global talent and slowing innovation. Brain drain risk : US labs and startups may lose key international talent. Shift in global leadership : As the Global South (especially Asia) is projected to drive two-thirds of future global growth, restrictive US policies may erode America\u2019s technological edge. India\u2019s Opportunity in Global Talent Realignment: India can attract returning professionals \u2014 scientists, clinicians, entrepreneurs \u2014 if it develops livable, well-governed cities. Focus areas: Quality healthcare Clean air and water Efficient public transport Affordable housing Predictable regulation and strong research institutions Urban India\u2019s Growth Potential and Challenges: As of now, just 15 Indian cities contribute 30% of India\u2019s GDP . Their ability to drive an extra 1.5% of growth will determine India\u2019s ambition to become a $30 trillion-plus economy by 2047. Challenges: Air pollution Water scarcity Urban flooding Solid waste mismanagement Poor municipal governance Addressing Urban Environmental Crises: Air pollution: With India home to approximately 42 of the 50 most polluted cities , vehicular emissions must be curtailed immediately. Required actions: Rapid electrification of public transport Enforcing construction dust norms Utilizing the \u20b91 lakh crore Urban Challenge Fund for performance-based incentives Waste management: The failure of municipal governance: It is evident in the fact that only a quarter of the 1,50,000 tonnes of solid waste generated daily is processed scientifically. Solutions : Infrastructure for collection and segregation, skilled municipal workforce, accountability-based policies, etc. Water scarcity: Addressing acute water shortage , which threatens 30 Indian cities, is critical. Steps required: Large-scale reuse and recycling of water, reduce 40\u201350% pipeline losses, introduce \u201c pay-as-you-use \u201d pricing with subsidies for the poor, etc. Rethinking Urban Planning and Housing: Revising Floor Space Index (FSI) policies: Restricting the FSI to artificially low levels drives urban sprawl and increases commuting distances. Indian planners must shift away from creating urban sprawls by allowing higher FSI and changing archaic regulations that limit optimal land usage. Lessons from Singapore : Dense vertical growth can ensure both livability and sustainability. Affordable housing: The shortfall of affordable homes, projected to triple to 31 million by 2030 , must be addressed. Measures: Promote higher FSI/FAR. Offer density-based incentives (as in Tokyo, S\u00e3o Paulo) for developers supporting social housing or transit systems. Transport and Mobility: Urban congestion reduces productivity. For example, congestion costs the average city dweller up to two hours daily. Solution: Invest in metro systems and electrified last-mile connectivity. Implement Transit Oriented Development ( TOD ) \u2014 focusing planning around rapid transit networks to foster compact, vertical growth, reduce car usage, and enhance productivity through agglomeration. Strengthening Urban Governance and Finance: India currently lacks sufficient urban planning capacity, with Niti Aayog reporting fewer than one planner per city. Steps needed: Build a professional cadre of urban managers Grant financial and administrative autonomy to cities Improve property tax collection and digitise land records Explore Land Value Capture (LVC) for municipal revenue (as in Hong Kong ) The Indore Model - A Template for Urban Success: Solid waste management : Segregated door-to-door collection, bio-CNG generation. Water management : India\u2019s first \u201c Water Plus \u201d city using GIS-based sewage monitoring and treated water reuse. Replicability : Indore demonstrates that efficiency, innovation, and accountability can coexist in municipal systems. Sustainable Urbanisation - The Next Growth Driver: Sustainable urbanisation will define India\u2019s prosperity . India already operates the world\u2019s 2nd-largest urban system , exceeding the combined urban populations of the US, UK, Germany, and Japan. In the last decade alone, India has added 91 million people (a 32% increase) to its urban population. By 2030, approximately 350 million people will move ", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

The IUCN has classified India\u2019s Western Ghats, along with Manas National Park (Assam) and Sundarbans National Park (West Bengal), as sites of \u201csignificant concern\u201d in its World Heritage Outlook 4 report . What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? IUCN World Heritage Outlook IUCN\u2019s Global Conservation Assessment India\u2019s Conservation Outlook: Mixed Picture for World Heritage Sites Why the Western Ghats Are Becoming Increasingly Fragile? A Glimmer of Hope for Global Biodiversity Conservation IUCN World Heritage Outlook The IUCN World Heritage Outlook is the only global assessment that evaluates all natural and mixed World Heritage sites every 3\u20135 years. It tracks their conservation status, identifies threats, and highlights best management practices to enhance long-term preservation. Implemented by the IUCN World Heritage Team and World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA), it provides reliable, transparent, and independent data about the state and prospects of these globally significant natural sites. This initiative supports stakeholders in aligning conservation strategies with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KM-GBF) goals for 2030. IUCN\u2019s Global Conservation Assessment The IUCN\u2019s World Heritage Outlook 4 report identifies climate change, tourism, invasive species, and road development as the four major threats to biodiversity loss in South Asia. It categorises sites as \u201cgood,\u201d \u201cgood with some concerns,\u201d \u201csignificant concern,\u201d and \u201ccritical,\u201d reflecting their conservation status and urgency of action. Based on four assessment cycles since 2014, the report finds that 40% of World Heritage sites face conservation concerns , with climate change emerging as the most pervasive threat and a decline in the number of sites showing positive conservation outlooks for the first time. India\u2019s Conservation Outlook: Mixed Picture for World Heritage Sites The IUCN World Heritage Outlook 4 (2025) shows a decline in global conservation health \u2014 only 57% of 228 sites assessed now have a positive outlook, down from 63% in 2014, 2017, and 2020. In Asia, climate change has replaced hunting as the most serious threat , followed by tourism, invasive species, and, for the first time, roads and railways, which are now among the top five dangers to natural heritage. Other growing threats include forest fires, encroachment, illegal logging, waste disposal, and road construction. In India, four sites are rated \u201cgood with some concerns \u201d \u2014 The Great Himalayan National Park, Kaziranga, Keoladeo, and Nanda Devi\u2013Valley of Flowers \u2014 while Khangchendzonga National Park (Sikkim) remains the only site rated \u201c \u201d The Western Ghats, though globally renowned for their ancient ecosystems and 325 threatened species, including the Nilgiri tahr, are now listed under \u201csignificant concern\u201d. This highlights urgent conservation needs for one of the world\u2019s richest biodiversity hotspots. Why the Western Ghats Are Becoming Increasingly Fragile? The Western Ghats, one of the world\u2019s richest biodiversity hotspots, face escalating threats from hydropower projects, tourism, plantations, and climate change . Projects like the Sillahalla Pumped Storage Hydroelectric Project in the Nilgiris involve dam construction across the Sillahalla and Kundah rivers, endangering forest ecosystems and river habitats. Unregulated tourism has led to garbage accumulation, often eaten by wildlife such as elephants, aggravating human-animal conflict. Commercial plantations are replacing natural forests, while invasive species like eucalyptus and acacia\u2014introduced during colonial times\u2014are spreading rapidly. Climate change is driving species like the Nilgiri flycatcher and black-and-orange flycatcher to shift to higher altitudes due to rising temperatures. Elsewhere, in the Sundarbans, salinity, pollution, over-extraction of resources, and sea level rise are eroding mangrove biodiversity and threatening iconic species like the swimming tigers. A Glimmer of Hope for Global Biodiversity Conservation Despite alarming trends, the IUCN report highlights positive examples of effective conservation and collaboration worldwide. Global Conservation Successes Seven sites in China , including the Badain Jaran Desert, Chengjiang Fossil Site, and Mount Huangshan, are recognised as \u201c best protected and managed\u201d areas . Such examples show that focused policies and community involvement can reverse ecological decline. A Call to Action Though Natural World Heritage sites cover less than 1% of Earth\u2019s surface , they nurture over 20% of global species richness , hosting 75,000 plant species and 30,000 animal species \u2014 making them vital for ecological stability. The report aligns with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework , urging nations to halt biodiversity loss through better integration of nature and culture in conservation.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s recent visit to India underscored the growing international interest in India\u2019s higher education sector. His 125-member delegation included 14 university vice-chancellors , highlighting education as a key area of cooperation. The initiative stems from India\u2019s National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 , which allows top 100 global universities to set up campuses in India to promote the internationalisation of education . In 2023, the University Grants Commission (UGC) issued detailed regulations for foreign universities to operate in India. Earlier, under the International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA) regulations of 2022, foreign universities were allowed to open campuses in Gujarat\u2019s GIFT City. So far, 17 foreign universities have received approval to establish campuses in India, including three already operational in Mumbai, the NCR (Gurgaon, Noida, Greater Noida), Chennai, and Bengaluru. The move is part of India\u2019s effort to raise global academic standards, retain students who go abroad for higher studies, and position India as an international education hub. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Foreign Universities Setting Up Campuses in India Courses and Offerings by UK Universities in India Why UK Universities Are Expanding to India? What UK Campuses in India Mean for Indian Students? Foreign Universities Setting Up Campuses in India Under the UGC\u2019s 2023 regulations , foreign universities ranked within the top 500 globally can apply to establish campuses in India. A total of 17 foreign universities have announced plans to set up campuses across India, most from the United Kingdom, with QS World University Rankings 2026 positions ranging from 51 to 558. Many of these UK universities already operate international branch campuses in Malaysia, China, Qatar, and Greece, but for some, such as Bristol, the India campus will be their first abroad. Six Australian universities have announced India plans. Among them: Deakin University and University of Wollongong have already begun operations in GIFT City. Italy\u2019s Istituto Europeo di Design, a renowned fashion school, will set up in Mumbai. From the United States, Illinois Tech will be the first to establish a campus in Mumbai, while globally, US universities lead with 84 overseas campuses, followed by UK institutions with 46. Courses and Offerings by UK Universities in India Most UK universities setting up campuses in India will offer: Three-year undergraduate (UG) courses and one-year master\u2019s (PG) programmes. Popular disciplines include Business Management, Computer Science, Accounting and Finance, Economics, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence (AI). As per UGC regulations, these universities must ensure identical curriculum, academic quality, and assessment standards as their home campuses . They can hire faculty from both India and abroad. Campus Capacity and Expansion Plans University of Bristol (Mumbai): To start with 250 students in the first year, growing to 2,500. Faculty will be a mix of Indian and Bristol-based staff. University of Liverpool (Bengaluru): Capacity for 2,500 students by 2030. University of Southampton (Gurgaon): Began in 2025 with 140 students, aiming to grow to 5,500 in the coming years. Tuition fees are significantly lower than studying in the UK \u2014 roughly half the cost . The new UK campuses in India aim to offer world-class, globally recognised degrees at more affordable costs , making international-quality education accessible to Indian students without the burden of overseas expenses. Why UK Universities Are Expanding to India? During UK PM Keir Starmer\u2019s visit, a joint statement highlighted the \u201c explosion in demand for higher education in India \u201d, creating a major opportunity for UK universities seeking new funding streams. India\u2019s growing youth population and the government\u2019s push to internationalise education under the NEP 2020 have made it a prime destination for global universities. Financial Pressures in the UK UK universities are facing a deep financial crisis: Tuition fee freeze for domestic students (for several years) and rising inflation have squeezed budgets. Institutions became dependent on international students, who pay higher fees. But with falling international enrolments, revenue has declined sharply. Search for New Revenue Sources The UK higher education sector is in a volatile environment and must \u201cfind new sources of revenue\u201d while maintaining quality. Establishing Indian campuses provides a sustainable model for income generation, job protection, and research expansion.

At the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea, US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met for the first time since Trump\u2019s return to office. Trump announced that China agreed to maintain global exports of rare earth minerals under a one-year deal , calling it a \u201cworldwide solution.\u201d He said this would remove supply worries for industries dependent on these materials. Additionally, the US will reduce tariffs on China \u2014cutting the penalty on fentanyl-related trade from 20% to 10%, bringing the overall tariff rate down from 57% to 47%. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Key Highlights of the Xi-Trump Meeting Implication for India in the G-2 world Key Highlights of the Xi-Trump Meeting The meeting was its carefully managed optics. Unlike his usual confrontational style, President Trump adopted a polite and diplomatic tone, showing awareness of China\u2019s global influence. Interestingly, China did not immediately release an official account of the meeting, highlighting its cautious approach. Trump\u2019s Recognition of China\u2019s Power Trump referred to the meeting as \u201c G-2\u201d, equating the US\u2013China relationship to elite global groupings like the G-7 and G-20 . This was seen as a symbolic recognition of China\u2019s global power, something no previous US president had done publicly \u2014 a clear diplomatic win for Beijing. Controlled Diplomacy Over Confrontation Both leaders showed mutual deference and restraint, a departure from Trump\u2019s usual brashness. Their conduct reflected a shared understanding of the delicate balance between the world\u2019s two largest economies and the global impact of their relationship. Deal on Rare Earth Exports The key takeaway from the Trump\u2013Xi meeting was about rare earth exports . President Trump announced that China had agreed to continue exporting rare earth minerals for one year \u2014 a relief for global industries that depend on them. In return for China\u2019s cooperation, Trump cut tariffs on Chinese goods by 10%, lowering total US tariffs from 57% to 47%. This move was meant to ease pressure on Chinese businesses and encourage Beijing to compromise. While the agreement eased tensions, it only postponed the core issue \u2014 China still dominates the rare earth supply chain. The deal gives the US and its allies more time to diversify sources and reduce dependency on China. Implication for India in the G-2 world In his first term (2017), Trump took a hard stance on China, calling it a strategic rival, strengthening alliances, and supporting frameworks like the Quad and Indo-Pacific strategy, where India played a central role. Now, in his second term, Trump\u2019s approach is commercial, focusing on trade deals and domestic investments, even pressuring allies like Japan and South Korea to invest heavily in the US. After the meeting, US President left behind a sense of uncertainty about America\u2019s future with China \u2014 the world\u2019s two largest powers. Calling his meeting with Xi Jinping a \u201cG-2\u201d summit , Trump sparked concern among allies that the US is leaning toward a China-first, business-focused policy. Implications for India and the Region For India, the message was clear: the US focus remains on managing China . The question now is whether Trump prefers working with allies like India, Japan, and Australia (under the Quad) or handling China alone . For India and other Asian nations, this marks a new phase in US\u2013China relations \u2014 a mix of competition and cooperation. Trade Disadvantage for India After Trump reduced tariffs on China to 47%, India now has the highest tariff rate at 50%, putting it at a trade disadvantage . This makes a US\u2013India trade deal more urgent. Until then, a US rival (China) enjoys better trade terms than a US partner (India). India\u2019s Strategic Path Forward As Trump\u2019s trade-driven strategy reshapes the region, India must rethink its assumptions about both American intent and Chinese ambition, while identifying space for its own strategic autonomy. For India, the challenge is to navigate this shifting US\u2013China balance with agility. Delhi must: Engage the US where interests align, Explore economic opportunities with China where possible, and Deepen partnerships with Asia and Europe to strengthen its independent position.

Math is Not a Tool for Cultural Nationalism Oct. 29, 2025 Context The controversy surrounding the University Grants Commission\u2019s (UGC) draft undergraduate mathematics curriculum under the National Education Policy (NEP) has ignited a crucial debate about the intersection of education, nationalism, and scientific inquiry . While the proposal aims to integrate traditional Indian mathematical knowledge into the modern curriculum, it has faced strong opposition from over 900 Indian mathematicians , who argue that it is pedagogically flawed and ideologically driven . At the heart of the issue lies a vital question: can a discipline grounded in universal truths, like mathematics, be reshaped through cultural or nationalist lenses without distorting its essence? The Core of the Controversy The draft curriculum has been criticised for its limited coverage of core subjects , neglect of applied mathematics , and poorly designed electives . More significantly, the inclusion of subjects such as Kala Ganpana (traditional Indian time calculation), Bharatiya Bijganit (Indian algebra), and Shulba Sutra (ancient altar geometry) has raised fears that the curriculum prioritises symbolic cultural revival over academic rigour . Opponents believe such content undermines the universal and scientific nature of mathematics , transforming it into a tool of ideological assertion rather than intellectual development . The Debate on Cultural Pride vs. Intellectual Integrity Supporters of the NEP, notably Manjul Bhargava , the 2014 Fields Medal winner , argue that India\u2019s mathematical heritage deserves rightful recognition . Bhargava maintains that acknowledging ancient contributions does not equate to glorifying one civilisation over another , but rather to restoring balance to a Eurocentric narrative . This effort to reclaim cultural pride is understandable and historically justified. Yet, an overemphasis on nationalism in mathematics risks replicating the very colonial mindset it seeks to resist . To portray mathematics as an exclusively Indic creation is to commit the same error of cultural monopolisation once made by colonial scholars. Mathematical truths transcend geography and culture , the proposition that 2 + 2 = 4 is neither Western nor Indian; it is simply true . When nationalism infiltrates a discipline built on logic and universality , it dilutes both its objectivity and global relevance . The Universal Character of Mathematics Mathematics draws strength from its universality and cumulative evolution . From Babylonian number systems to Greek geometry , from Indian algebra to Arabic numerals , its history is a story of cross-cultural collaboration rather than isolated civilisational achievements. To confine its teaching within a Vedic or Indic framework is both historically inaccurate and pedagogically unsound . Moreover, most mathematics instructors lack formal training in Indology and may struggle to interpret ancient texts by Aryabhata, Brahmagupta, or Bhaskara with academic neutrality. Without such preparation, there is a risk of ideological bias , where students absorb mythologised history instead of scientific reasoning . A modern curriculum must therefore balance cultural appreciation with analytical depth , ensuring that historical context complements, not replaces, technical competence. The Broader Implications for Education and Democracy The debate extends beyond curriculum design into the philosophical purpose of education and the defence of rational inquiry in a democracy . When knowledge becomes a vehicle for nationalism , education ceases to serve truth and begins to serve ideology. The danger lies in replacing scientific evidence with cultural rhetoric , as seen in the increasing frequency of pseudoscientific claims made by public figures, such as assertions that mythological deities were the first space travellers. In a world defined by artificial intelligence, data science, and global collaboration , India\u2019s academic strength depends on rigorous, evidence-based education , not revivalist sentiment. Scientific reasoning must remain the cornerstone of democratic progress , ensuring that national pride complements, rather than compromises, intellectual honesty. Conclusion The debate over the UGC\u2019s mathematics curriculum reveals a fundamental tension between cultural recognition and intellectual integrity . Acknowledging India\u2019s mathematical heritage is essential, but embedding it within a nationalist framework threatens to undermine the universal, collaborative nature of knowledge . Mathematics belongs to humanity , not to any single civilisation. Education should empower students to think critically and globally , nurturing pride in heritage without sacrificing scientific objectivity . Only through such balance can India\u2019s educational reforms truly strengthen both national identity and intellectual freedom .

Recently, the Supreme Court ruled that a person can reject a property sale made by their guardian after turning 18 if it was done without court approval. The court said this can be done either by filing a case or through actions\u2014for example, reselling the property\u2014within the legal time limit. The bench of Justices Pankaj Mithal and Prasanna B. Varale clarified that a formal lawsuit is not always necessary, reaffirming that a minor\u2019s property rights can be protected by their clear conduct showing refusal of the sale. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Laws Governing Property of Minors Background of the Case Supreme Court on How Minors Can Reject Property Sales Laws Governing Property Rights of Minors Property transactions involving minors are regulated by three key laws: The Indian Contract Act, 1872 The Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 The Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 Minors Cannot Enter into Contracts Under Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act , only adults of sound mind can enter into valid contracts. Any contract made by a minor is void from the beginning (void ab initio). This means it cannot be enforced by or against the minor. Exceptions: If the contract benefits the minor or provides necessities like food or education, the cost may be recovered from the minor\u2019s property. A guardian can enter into a contract only if it benefits the minor. A minor cannot be a business partner but may receive profit shares under a valid agreement. Restrictions on Guardian\u2019s Power to Sell Property Under Section 8 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act , 1956, a natural guardian can manage a minor\u2019s property only for their benefit. The guardian cannot sell, mortgage, gift, or lease immovable property without court approval. If such a sale happens, Section 8(3) makes it \u201cvoidable at the instance of the minor\u201d, meaning the minor can cancel it after turning 18. Similarly, Section 29 of the Guardians and Wards Act , 1890 also says a guardian needs court permission to dispose of a ward\u2019s property. How a Minor Can Challenge the Sale After Majority? When a guardian sells property without permission, the law allows the now-adult person to challenge it. Traditionally, courts held that a formal case must be filed to cancel such a sale. However, in Abdul Rahman v. Sukhdayal Singh (1905), the court ruled that filing a suit is not always necessary \u2014 a clear act of repudiation, like reselling the property, is enough to show rejection. Time Limit for Challenging Such Sales According to the Limitation Act, 1963 , the person has three years after turning 18 to challenge or reject a property sale made by their guardian without court approval. Background of the Case The dispute involved two small plots (No. 56 and 57) in Davanagere, Karnataka, bought in 1971 by a father in the names of his three minor sons. Acting as their natural guardian, he later sold both plots without obtaining mandatory court approval. After turning 18, the sons resold both plots to another person, leading to two separate ownership disputes. What Happened in the Lower Courts? In the Plot 56 case, the High Court (2003) ruled that the sons\u2019 resale amounted to a valid rejection of their father\u2019s earlier sale. The ruling became final as it was not challenged. In the Plot 57 case, the buyer filed a case in 1997 claiming ownership. The trial court dismissed the suit, holding that the father\u2019s sale was voidable and had been repudiated when the sons sold it after reaching adulthood. Appeals and High Court Ruling The first appellate court and the High Court later reversed the trial court\u2019s decision, saying the sons\u2019 later sale was invalid because they had not filed a formal case to cancel their father\u2019s sale . The High Court declared the buyer as the rightful owner of Plot 57. Supreme Court Appeal This decision was challenged before the Supreme Court, which was asked to decide whether a person who was a minor at the time of sale must file a formal case to cancel the sale or can reject it by conduct after attaining majority. Supreme Court on How Minors Can Reject Property Sales The Supreme Court clarified how a person can repudiate (reject) a property sale made by their guardian without court approval once they become an adult. The Court ruled that a minor, after turning 18 , can reject such a sale in two ways : By filing a formal case (suit) to cancel the sale deed, or By clear conduct that shows they do not accept the earlier sale \u2014 for example, reselling the property or taking actions inconsistent with the guardian\u2019s sale. The Court said that once the person rejects the sale, it becomes void from the beginning , and the buyer gains no rights over the property. Application in This Case The Court observed that the sons, after becoming adults, sold the same property within three years \u2014 the period allowed under law.

Amid worsening air quality, the Delhi government, in collaboration with IIT-Kanpur, conducted two cloud-seeding trials to induce artificial rain, though only negligible rainfall was recorded \u2014 0.1 mm in Noida and 0.2 mm in Greater Noida. According to experts, the weak results were due to low cloud moisture (15\u201320% humidity), but more sorties are planned as better moisture conditions are expected in coming days. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Cloud Seeding Why Cloud-Seeding Trials in Delhi Failed to Induce Rain? How Cloud Seeding Helped Reduce Pollution? Conclusion Cloud Seeding It is a weather modification technique used to enhance rainfall by introducing \u201cseed\u201d particles into suitable clouds. The method was first tested globally in the 1940s. The process involves dispersing cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) \u2014 particles that attract water vapour \u2014 or ice nuclei particles, which promote ice crystal formation. In natural conditions, water vapour condenses around airborne particles to form droplets that grow, collide, and eventually fall as rain. In cloud seeding, artificial nuclei such as silver iodide or salt particles are added to accelerate this process. Ice crystals grow faster, combine, and become heavy enough to precipitate, increasing the likelihood of rainfall. Process of Cloud Seeding To artificially induce rain, salts such as silver iodide, potassium iodide, or sodium chloride are used as \u201cseeds\u201d to create additional nuclei for cloud droplet formation. These particles are dispersed into clouds using aircraft, ground-based generators, rockets, drones, or flares. The method chosen depends on cloud type and conditions. Conditions Needed for Successful Cloud Seeding Cloud seeding can only be done when suitable clouds with adequate depth and moisture are present. As per the experts, cloud seeding needs humidity above 50% , cool temperatures , and existing cloud formation . The process requires a sufficient number of droplets inside clouds to enlarge through condensation and eventually fall as rain. It cannot be done under clear skies. In Delhi\u2019s winters, cloud formation depends on western disturbances \u2014 weather systems originating from the Caspian or Mediterranean Sea that bring non-monsoonal rain to northwest India. However, these clouds often lack the required depth and liquid water content for effective seeding. Experts emphasize that before any attempt, it\u2019s essential to assess cloud height, moisture levels, and liquid water content using specialized monitoring tools to determine if conditions are right for seeding. Environmental concerns Silver iodide (AgI), used in seeding, is insoluble but toxic in large quantities. Even small amounts (0.2 micrograms) can harm fish and microorganisms, though iodine in AgI is not considered toxic. Why Cloud-Seeding Trials in Delhi Failed to Induce Rain? A Delhi government report cited low atmospheric moisture (10\u201315%), as predicted by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), as the main reason the cloud-seeding trials did not produce significant rainfall. Experts explained that although there was good cloud cover, moisture levels were too low to trigger rain. They added that the team gained technical experience from the trials and would conduct a third round once weather conditions improve. Limited Rainfall and Technical Challenges Experts noted that while Delhi plans more trials, cloud seeding in convective, low-level clouds remains highly uncertain . Success depends on timing, cloud type, altitude, and adequate moisture, conditions that are rarely met over the plains. Cloud bases were around 10,000 feet, which meteorologists said was too high for effective seeding. If clouds descend below 5,000 feet, chances of rainfall improve. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) notes that the biggest challenge is quantifying seeding\u2019s actual impact on precipitation . How Cloud Seeding Helped Reduce Pollution? Despite limited rainfall \u2014 0.1 mm in Noida and 0.2 mm in Greater Noida \u2014 the trials had a measurable impact on air quality. According to the Delhi government\u2019s report, levels of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) dropped after cloud seeding: PM2.5 fell from 221\u2013230 to 203\u2013207 across Mayur Vihar, Karol Bagh, and Burari. PM10 reduced from 206\u2013209 to 163\u2013177 in the same areas. The report concluded that while rainfall was minimal, pollution reduction was evident, offering valuable insights for future cloud-seeding efforts. Air Quality and Broader Solutions Air quality analysts cautioned that cloud seeding does not address emissions at their source. Experts point out that such measures \u2014 like smog towers or anti-smog guns \u2014 offer only short-term benefits. Sustainable improvement requires coordinated action across states, targeting emissions from transport, power plants, and construction, under an airshed-based approach.

A Decade After Paris Accord, An Unstoppable Transition Oct. 30, 2025 Context Ten years after the adoption of the Paris Agreement at COP21 , the world faces a defining moment in its struggle against climate change. Despite the global pledge to keep warming well below 2\u00b0C and strive for 1.5\u00b0C , emissions and temperatures continue to rise at alarming rates. Floods, droughts, and heatwaves strike with increasing intensity, from Uttarakhand to Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir , reminding humanity that the climate crisis is no longer a distant threat but a lived reality. Yet, amid these challenges, the Paris framework has changed the world\u2019s trajectory , demonstrating that collective determination and multilateral cooperation can alter the course of history. From a 5\u00b0C Future to a 2\u00b0C Pathway Before 2015, the planet was heading toward a catastrophic 4\u00b0C\u20135\u00b0C of warming by the century\u2019s end. Through global commitment and cooperation, that curve has been bent downward toward 2\u00b0C\u20133\u00b0C . This remains far from the safe zone identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) , yet it represents undeniable progress. The shift proves that collective action works , and that multilateralism, though imperfect, remains essential. The Paris Agreement\u2019s success lies in its fairness, flexibility, and solidarity , enabling countries with different capabilities to contribute according to their national circumstances while sharing responsibility for the global good. A Decade After Paris Accord: Transforming the Global Economy The past decade has witnessed a turning point in global energy and economic systems . Ten years ago, fossil fuels were the cheapest and most competitive energy source. Today, renewables such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power are leading new waves of growth and employment. This transformation marks a breakthrough for energy security, economic sovereignty, and environmental resilience . Equally remarkable is the rise of electric mobility . What once seemed an elusive dream has become a worldwide phenomenon. With electric vehicles accounting for nearly 20% of global new car sales , the transportation sector stands at the brink of a historic shift away from fossil fuels. The Power of Partnership: The International Solar Alliance (ISA) Among the most inspiring achievements of the Paris decade stands the ISA , conceived at COP21 through the collaboration of India and France . What began as a visionary idea has evolved into a global coalition of over 120 countries , dedicated to making solar energy accessible to all. The ISA demonstrates how multilateralism can translate vision into action , fostering capacity building, financing mechanisms, and technological exchange. India\u2019s leadership within this alliance reflects its growing stature in the global green transition. By securing 50% of its installed electricity capacity from non-fossil sources five years ahead of schedule , India shows that development and decarbonisation can advance together . Priorities for the Next Decade First , global ambition must rise sharply. Despite improvements, current pledges remain insufficient. Nations must act decisively to reduce carbon emissions and preserve a liveable planet. Second , the global transition must be just and inclusive , protecting the most vulnerable communities. Investments in adaptation and resilience, through mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund , the Loss and Damage Fund , and initiatives like CREWS \u2014are vital to ensure that no nation or community is left behind. Third , the protection of natural carbon sinks , forests, mangroves, and oceans, must become a universal priority. These ecosystems, from the Amazon to the Sundarbans , are the planet\u2019s best allies in absorbing carbon and safeguarding biodiversity. Fourth , non-state actors must be empowered. Local governments, scientists, businesses, and citizens play decisive roles in translating ambition into tangible outcomes. Their engagement transforms global commitments into visible, community-level results. Fifth , science must guide the transition . In an era clouded by misinformation, defending the integrity of the IPCC and promoting climate education are essential to ensure that facts, not fear, shape global decisions. Conclusion A decade after Paris, the world\u2019s climate journey stands at a crossroads between progress and peril. The achievements of the past ten years reveal a powerful truth: when nations unite under shared purpose, transformation follows . The Paris Agreement has redefined the global climate order, proving that multilateralism can deliver measurable change , that renewable energy can drive prosperity, and that adaptation and equity can coexist with ambition. The future remains uncertain, but the direction is clear. The world has chosen a path toward sustainability, and that path, however demanding, is unstoppable .

AI\u2019s Rewriting of the Rules of Education Oct. 31, 2025 Context India stands on the threshold of a paradigm shift in education , poised to introduce Artificial Intelligence (AI) into classrooms as early as Class 3 starting in 2026\u201327. This transformative move, aligned with the National Education Policy 2020, reflects a bold ambition: to prepare future generations for an AI-powered global economy. Also, it is important to ensure the nation remains competitive in an era defined by automation and digital innovation. AI as a Catalyst for Educational Reform The integration of AI into the K-12 system is not merely a technological upgrade, it represents a reimagining of how learning occurs. AI-driven platforms offer personalised learning pathways , adjusting instruction based on a student\u2019s pace, strengths, and struggles. Such adaptive systems can democratise education by supporting learners with diverse needs , addressing regional language barriers, and creating more inclusive environments, a particularly critical objective in India\u2019s vast socio-educational landscape. Teachers at the Core of Transformation However, technology alone cannot revolutionise education. With over one crore teachers nationwide, the success of this initiative hinges on capacity-building and continuous professional development. Pilot programmes have already trained thousands of educators , equipping them with AI tools for lesson planning and resource design. Yet, the magnitude of upskilling required raises crucial questions : Are teachers adequately prepared to transition from traditional instructors to AI-guided mentors? The answer will determine the pace and depth of this reform. Balancing Technology with Human Insight Despite the power of AI, human educators remain irreplaceable. AI can automate administrative tasks like grading and attendance, offering teachers more time for creative instruction, emotional support, and personalised interaction, areas where machines cannot replicate human empathy and intuition. In this hybrid model, teachers evolve into facilitators of higher-order thinking , supported rather than overshadowed by technology. The Future Workforce: Promise and Challenge The integration of AI into education also reflects broader shifts in labour markets. While projections suggest millions of jobs may be disrupted, AI could generate even more employment opportunities by 2030. Equipping students with AI literacy from early grades ensures they are prepared not only to navigate but to thrive in a rapidly evolving digital economy. Yet, this requires not only technical skills but resilience, creativity, and ethical awareness . Bridging the Inequality Gap One of the most compelling promises of AI in education is its potential to expand access and equity. From generative AI tutors to multilingual learning tools, technology could help close achievement gaps and extend quality education beyond urban hubs. However, this promise is contingent upon addressing digital infrastructure disparities and ensuring affordability, without which the AI revolution risks widening existing inequalities instead of reducing them. Conclusion India\u2019s initiative to embed AI into school education marks a watershed moment for its learning ecosystem. It embodies aspiration, innovation, and foresight , yet also raises critical questions about readiness, inclusivity, and ethical implementation. The future of India\u2019s education system will depend on thoughtful policy, teacher empowerment, and equitable access. As the nation navigates this transformation, one truth stands clear: AI is not merely a tool but a catalyst, reshaping the very contours of learning and unlocking possibilities for a generation preparing to shape the AI-driven world.

The Contours of Constitutional Morality Oct. 27, 2025 Context The relationship between law and morality has long occupied jurists, philosophers, and lawmakers alike. It is an enduring question: should the law enforce moral standards, or should it remain neutra l, detached from ethical imperatives? From the ancient notion of dharma to the modern constitutional framework, India\u2019s legal evolution reflects this tension between moral values and legal obligations. The dialogue between morality and law, far from being a relic of philosophical discourse, remains crucial to the vitality of modern constitutional democracy. Law and Morality: A Historical Context The debate over the intersection of law and morality reached its zenith during the Hart\u2013Devlin debate (1960s). Lord Devlin argued that law must enforce moral standards to preserve societal cohesion , while H.L.A. Hart warned against conflating moral disapproval with legal prohibition. This theoretical divide found reflection in Shaw v. DPP (1962 AC 220), where the House of Lords affirmed a residual power to conserve not only the safety and order but also the moral welfare of the State. The Indian judiciary has also recognised this relationship. In Rathinam v. Union of India (1994), the Supreme Court quoted Justice Frankfurter\u2019s observation in Solesbee v. Balkcom (1949) that the law embodies a system of rights based on moral principles \u2026 which comports with the deepest notions of what is fair and right and just. This understanding resonates with India\u2019s civilisational ethos , the ancient concept of dharma, which unified legal duty and moral virtue. The Tirukkural, for instance, emphasised Aram (virtue) as the foundation of righteous living, demonstrating that law and morality were once inseparable in Indian thought. Dynamic Interaction Between Law and Morality The interplay between law and morality is neither static nor one-dimensional. Sometimes, law leads morality, as seen in the abolition of untouchability, which preceded full social acceptance. At other times, law follows morality, as in the gradual recognition of gender equality shaped by evolving public consciousness. This dynamic underscores the law\u2019s dual function : to reflect society\u2019s ethical standards and to guide them toward higher ideals. Yet, this also presents a challenge : laws must embody fundamental ethical imperatives, not merely majoritarian opinions or transient sentiments. For a diverse and pluralistic democracy like India, such balance is essential to ensure justice, inclusivity, and legitimacy. Constitutional Morality: The Indian Perspective The Supreme Court of India has deepened this moral discourse through the doctrine of constitutional morality. In State (NCT of Delhi) v. Union of India, the Court held that constitutional morality is more than mere allegiance to constitutional text. It includes liberal values , participatory governance, and ethical conduct by constitutional functionaries. Similarly, in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) v. Union of India, the Court affirmed that constitutional morality requires the state to act within the bounds of the rule of law and to respect judicial orders. These judgments collectively affirm that constitutional morality serves as a normative compass , ensuring that power is exercised with fairness, accountability, and restraint. Thus, morality in governance is not optional, it is a constitutional obligation. Beyond the Courts: Accountability and Democratic Ethics Breaches of constitutional morality may not always be legally punishable. They can manifest as violations of constitutional conventions or democratic principles , which are best remedied through political and civic accountability, in Parliament, the media, or by the electorate. This broader understanding reminds us that courts are not the sole guardians of constitutional ethics. The preservation of constitutional morality is a shared responsibility , among citizens, lawmakers, and public institutions. The Road Ahead: Nurturing Constitutional Morality The future of India\u2019s democracy depends on the cultivation of constitutional morality among lawmakers, judges, and citizens alike. As Dr. B.R. Ambedkar wisely cautioned, constitutional morality is not a natural sentiment, it has to be cultivated. When nurtured, it transforms the Constitution from a legal document into a living moral charter , one that guarantees justice, equality, and inclusion. In an era of rapid change, constitutional morality provides the ethical foundation necessary to uphold human dignity and democratic stability. Conclusion The relationship between law and morality is both timeless and evolving. From the ancient principle of dharma to modern constitutional jurisprudence , morality has remained the soul of justice. To ensure that democracy is not a mere top dressing on Indian soil but its vital ingredient, India must continue to nurture constitutional morality.

Eight States with International Borders, 0.13% of Exports Sept. 26, 2025 Context When the United States imposed a 25% tariff hike on Indian imports in August 2025, New Delhi\u2019s response was predictable: muted rhetoric, quiet diplomacy, and no open retaliation. This familiar choreography, Washington striking, India absorbing , was framed as another episode in turbulent bilateral ties. Yet beneath the surface, these tariffs revealed not merely a dispute between two capitals, but deeper structural weaknesses within India\u2019s own economic geography. The Geography of Export Concentration India\u2019s export economy is far from evenly distributed. Four states, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka, dominate, accounting for over 70% of merchandise exports , with Gujarat alone contributing more than 33%. This dominance is no accident ; it reflects decades of infrastructure development, policy incentives, and political continuity concentrated in these zones. In contrast, the populous heartland states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh together muster barely 5% of outbound trade, underscoring the stark disparities in India\u2019s export geography. The Marginalisation of the Northeast Nowhere is this imbalance more evident than in the northeast, a region of eight states sharing 5,400 kilometres of international borders but contributing just 0.13% to national exports. The exclusion is not accidental; it is structural . There are no operational trade corridors linking the northeast to global markets, no logistical infrastructure capable of supporting volume, and no institutional presence in national trade policymaking bodies. Flagship export schemes, such as the Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products ( RoDTEP ) and the Production-Linked Incentive ( PLI ), are implemented in industrial belts of western and southern India. While the northeast remains symbolically embraced but economically orphaned. Even the Directorate General of Foreign Trade\u2019s 2024 strategic export plan omitted the region entirely, a silence that elicited no protest, as if its exclusion were natural. The consequences are tangible . Assam\u2019s tea industry, responsible for more than half of India\u2019s tea output, remains vulnerable due to low value-addition and dependence on bulk CTC-grade auctions. Borders as Bottlenecks The northeast\u2019s trade potential has also been crippled by its borders. India\u2019s once-promising gateways to Myanmar , Zokhawthar in Mizoram and Moreh in Manipur, have withered into securitised outposts. Since Myanmar\u2019s 2021 coup, cross-border trade has thinned, infrastructure has stagnated, and the 2024 scrapping of the Free Movement Regime severed not only commerce but also kinship economies. Instead of functioning as bridges to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), these frontiers have become grids of containment . Goods do not flow; troops do . Roads exist largely on paper, customs offices are understaffed, and logistical facilities are absent. China, meanwhile, consolidates its foothold in northern Myanmar through investments and alliances, outpacing India\u2019s rhetoric of Act East with hard infrastructure. Broader Implication and the Way Forward Broader Implication: Asia Moves, India Hesitates This paralysis contrasts starkly with the dynamism elsewhere in Asia. China and Southeast Asia are actively repositioning capital , building corridors, and restructuring supply chains to adapt to global shifts. India, by contrast, negotiates trade agreements with Western powers while leaving its eastern frontier disconnected from the substance of global commerce. The assumption that trade can remain tethered to colonial-era ports and post-independence clusters ignores geography and undercuts resilience. Without integrating the northeast into national and regional trade frameworks, India undermines its claim to Indo-Pacific centrality. The Way Forward: Toward a Cohesive Economy Trump\u2019s tariffs will not, on their own, derail India\u2019s economy . But they expose the fragility of an export model concentrated in a few enclaves while neglecting entire regions. A cohesive national economy requires dispersion of capacity, not dependence; infrastructure that connects peripheries, not just coasts; and governance that recognises geography, not just electoral arithmetic. The northeast does not demand slogans. It needs the minimum grammar of statecraft: roads that connect to markets, policies that incorporate its geographies, and representation in institutions that shape trade strategy . For decades, it has been asked to wait, through insurgencies, ceasefires , and empty acronyms, while the world reconfigures its trade flows. Delay now resembles design. Conclusion India cannot claim regional heft while its eastern flank remains economically brittle . Tariffs may be episodic, but the structural omission of the northeast corrodes the promise of a cohesive economy.

An Engels\u2019 Pause in an AI-Shaped World Sept. 29, 2025 Context The rapid rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has sparked debates about its potential to transform industries, economies, and societies at large. Geoffrey Hinton, Nobel Laureate and pioneer of AI, recently warned that this revolution may enrich a select few while leaving the majority poorer. His cautionary note echoes a historical parallel known as the Engels\u2019 pause , a period during the early Industrial Revolution when economic output soared but living standards for ordinary workers stagnated. The question that looms today is whether the world is entering a modern Engels\u2019 pause in the AI era , one where productivity accelerates but shared prosperity lags behind. The Engels\u2019 Pause in Historical Context Coined by economist Robert Allen , the term Engels\u2019 pause refers to early 19th-century Britain , where despite immense industrial expansion, real wages stagnated and inequality deepened. While Britain became the workshop of the world, ordinary households saw little improvement in welfare, as food absorbed most of their income and social inequalities widened. It was only decades later, through reforms , institutional changes, and new social contracts, that broad-based prosperity emerged. This historical paradox frames a crucial debate in the present: whether AI, as a general-purpose technology (GPT) akin to steam power or electricity, will generate similar delays between technological progress and widespread welfare gains. AI as a General-Purpose Technology AI fits the profile of a GPT , capable of reshaping multiple industries simultaneously. As Agrawal, Gans, and Goldfarb (2018) argued, its unique economic contribution lies in drastically lowering the cost of prediction. Yet, as history shows, GPTs bring both growth and dislocation. They demand complementary innovations, institutional adaptation, and new skills before benefits trickle down. Without such adjustments, the gains are often captured by a few entrepreneurs or dominant firms, leaving the broader workforce vulnerable to job displacement and wage stagnation. Signs of a Modern Engels\u2019 Pause Productivity without wage growth In Philippine call centres, AI copilots have boosted productivity by 30\u201350%, improving efficiency and cutting costs for firms. Yet, workers\u2019 wages have remained stagnant , and workloads have intensified. Rising living costs only compound the sense of declining welfare. Rising costs of complements To remain relevant in the AI economy, workers must constantly reskill through coding boot camps, certifications, and training programs. These costs parallel the 19th-century phenomenon where higher nominal wages were offset by surging food prices, leaving workers no better off. Concentration of gains and inequality PwC projects that AI could add $15.7 trillion to global GDP by 2030 . However, most gains are likely to accrue to the U.S., China, and a handful of firms controlling foundational models. For much of the global workforce, particularly in developing economies, welfare improvements may be delayed or even denied. Job displacement and task transformation From AI-powered hospitals in China to AI adoption in airports and public administration, tasks are rapidly being transformed. While some roles are complemented, others are displaced, raising concerns about structural unemployment and growing inequality. Lessons from History and Policy Responses The Industrial Revolution eventually delivered prosperity , but only after decades of inequality and social unrest, which prompted reforms such as trade unions, public education, and welfare institutions. The same logic applies today: governance, not technology alone, determines whether AI delivers broad human welfare. Key policy responses include: Skills transition programs: Initiatives like Singapore\u2019s SkillsFuture or Abu Dhabi\u2019s AI-focused university (MBZUAI) exemplify efforts to build human capital for an AI-driven future. Redistribution of AI rents: Mechanisms such as robot taxes, Universal Basic Income (UBI), and philanthropic contributions could help spread the benefits of AI more equitably. AI infrastructure as a public good: Compute power and data access, the lifeblood of AI, must not remain prohibitively expensive or monopolised. Publicly funded open AI models, such as those launched in the UAE and Switzerland, mark steps in this direction. Counterarguments and Optimism Critics of the Engels\u2019 pause analogy argue that contemporary societies are better equipped than 19th-century Britain. Stronger welfare systems, faster technological diffusion, and the potential for AI to lower costs in healthcare, education, and energy could shorten or even prevent an extended pause. For instance, smartphones reached billions in under a decade , and AI assistants could follow a similar trajectory if deployed equitably. However, optimism must be tempered by caution .

Shaping the Next Chapter of the Indian Story Sept. 27, 2025 Context The leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has often been praised for its charisma and organizational skill. Yet, beneath the spectacle lies a deeper, less acknowledged trait, an ethic of discipline, preparation, and systemic thinking. This professionalism, developed through decades of public service as Chief Minister of Gujarat and later as Prime Minister of India, forms the foundation of his governance style. Modi\u2019s approach, as seen through policy choices and personal habits, highlights a distinctive emphasis on action , inclusion, and institution-building, rather than mere rhetoric. PM Modi\u2019s Approach Towards Governance Vision Anchored in Duty What sets Modi apart is not simply his ability to capture public imagination but his consistent transformation of vision into functioning systems. His work ethic is evident in his rigorous preparation , as illustrated by personal anecdotes of meetings where hours of study precede discussions. This discipline reflects a larger philosophy: governance should not rest on symbolic gestures but on outcomes that make a tangible difference to citizens. This ethic framed his Independence Day address , which went beyond celebration to outline a charter for shared work. Citizens, scientists, states, and start-ups were invited to participate in the project of Viksit Bharat (a developed India). The speech emphasised practical ambitions, in deep technology, clean energy, and resilient supply chains, with Jan Bhagidari (people\u2019s participation) as the method. Policy as a Living Instrument A central feature of Modi\u2019s governance has been treating policy as adaptive and responsive rather than static. The simplification of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) illustrates this method. By reducing tax slabs and minimizing friction points, the reform lowered compliance burdens on small businesses and ensured quicker benefits to consumers. The focus was not on abstract fiscal calculations but on the experience of everyday citizens and traders. This adaptability also reflects cooperative federalism , the ongoing dialogue between the Centre and states within the GST Council. Rather than preserving rigid uniformity, policy here becomes a living instrument, tuned to the rhythm of the economy. It is governance designed for responsiveness rather than permanence on paper. Citizen-Centric Systems Perhaps the most transformative legacy of recent years lies in the creation of systems that empower citizens at scale. The triad of digital identity (Aadhaar), universal bank accounts, and real-time payments has redefined inclusion by embedding it into infrastructure. Benefits now reach verified citizens directly, reducing leakages and ensuring predictability for small businesses. Data, not anecdotes, shapes policy design. The principle of Antyodaya, uplifting the last citizen, is not just a rhetorical flourish but a litmus test for every programme reaching the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. A striking example of this citizen focus was seen during the launch of India\u2019s first bamboo-based 2G ethanol plant in Assam. Some Other PM Modi\u2019s Commendable Governance Approach Clarity in Economic and Strategic Statecraft This clarity extends beyond domestic policy to India\u2019s external engagements. In energy , India has pursued a diversified supplier basket , ensuring affordability and stability during global volatility. Negotiations abroad were guided by a simple but powerful brief: secure supplies, protect consumers, and prioritise national interest. National security has been approached in the same manner , without unnecessary drama but with resolve and restraint. Operations are defined by clear objectives , operational freedom for security forces, and protection of civilians. Once again, the ethic is evident: outcomes matter more than posturing. A Distinctive Work Culture Behind these decisions lies a distinctive working style . Modi cultivates an environment where discussions are rigorous but respectful, where the best argument, not the loudest, prevails. Preparation is rewarded, responsibility is clearly assigned, and follow-up is relentless . In this culture, drift is not tolerated, and performance is measured against defined metrics. This ethos points to a broader philosophy of institution-building. Modi\u2019s birthday coincides with Vishwakarma Jayanti, a symbolic reminder that lasting monuments in public life are not statues or spectacles but institutions, platforms, and standards that endure. For citizens, this translates into services delivered efficiently and affordably. For businesses, it means clarity of policy and predictability. For the state, it means systems that withstand stress and evolve over time. Conclusion PM Modi\u2019s leadership is defined by an ethic of hard work, attention to detail , and a citizen-first orientation.

On September 26, the Indian Air Force formally retired its iconic MiG-21 fighter jets, with the last two squadrons \u2014 No. 23 (Panthers) and No. 3 (Cobras), operating 36 jets \u2014 decommissioned in Chandigarh. The move marks the end of a Soviet-era legacy but also highlights the IAF\u2019s shrinking squadron strength, underscoring the challenges it faces in modernising its fleet. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? MiG-21: India\u2019s Trusted but Controversial Fighter IAF\u2019s Fighter Shortfall and Growing Reliance on Air Defence Rebuilding IAF\u2019s Fighter Fleet: Indigenous and Global Plans Persistent Delays in Aircraft Induction MiG-21: India\u2019s Trusted but Controversial Fighter Inducted in 1963 as cutting-edge interceptors, MiG-21s became the backbone of the Indian Air Force, fighting in the 1965, 1971, and Kargil wars. Over 700 jets of various variants were procured, with the latest Bison upgrades adding advanced avionics, radar, and missiles. However, engine flaws plagued the single-engine aircraft, contributing to over 500 crashes and 170 pilot deaths in six decades, including more than 20 since 2010. Despite this record, many IAF veterans argue the MiG-21\u2019s performance and longevity make its safety record better than often perceived. IAF\u2019s Fighter Shortfall and Growing Reliance on Air Defence The retirement of the MiG-21s has reduced the Indian Air Force\u2019s strength to 29 fighter squadrons , well below the sanctioned 42 \u2014 a target that has never been met. This decline poses serious concerns, especially in the event of a simultaneous conflict with Pakistan and China. While Pakistan maintains an estimated 20\u201325 squadrons, China\u2019s strength exceeds 60, giving both adversaries a numerical edge. Each squadron comprises 16\u201318 jets, making the shortfall significant. The challenge will deepen in the coming decade, as several older aircraft \u2014 including the MiG-29s, Jaguars, and Mirage 2000s \u2014 are slated for phase-out by 2035. Unless new fighters are inducted soon, India risks falling further behind its regional rivals in air power. Focus on Air Defence Given this reality, military planners are currently focused on bolstering India\u2019s air defence capabilities to offset the shortage of fighters. Advanced systems like the Russian S-400 mobile surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, despite U.S. opposition, have been inducted into service. Additionally, India\u2019s indigenous Akashteer air-defence system has been deployed. Both systems demonstrated their effectiveness during Operation Sindoor, underscoring their role as critical stopgaps in safeguarding India\u2019s skies until new fighter jets can fill the squadron gap. Rebuilding IAF\u2019s Fighter Fleet: Indigenous and Global Plans To address its shrinking fighter fleet, the IAF is banking heavily on indigenous aircraft . Currently operating two squadrons of Tejas Mk1 , the IAF is set to induct 180 upgraded Tejas Mk1A jets from HAL. The Mk1A brings advanced features such as AESA radar, an electronic warfare suite with jammers, and enhanced beyond-visual-range (BVR) capabilities through Derby and ASTRA missile integration. In addition, HAL is working on Tejas Mk2 and the fifth-generation stealth Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA ), expected to join the IAF in the next decade. Global Fighter Procurement Plans Alongside indigenous projects, the IAF is also pursuing the acquisition of 114 fighters from global manufacturers. The Dassault Rafale is reportedly the frontrunner, with plans to procure some jets in flyaway condition for immediate reinforcement. The majority, however, will likely be manufactured in India under a partnership between Dassault and Indian firms, strengthening the domestic defence ecosystem. Su-30MKI Upgrades India also intends to modernise its existing fleet of 84 Su-30MKI aircraft under the \u201cSuper-30\u201d program. This upgrade aims to extend their service life and enhance combat effectiveness, ensuring they remain a backbone of the IAF until newer platforms are fully inducted. Persistent Delays in Aircraft Induction The Indian Air Force continues to grapple with delays in aircraft development and delivery, forcing the MiG-21 to remain operational well beyond its planned phase-out due to the lack of replacements. The LCA and Tejas Mk1A Delays The LCA program, conceived in the 1980s, has seen repeated setbacks. Out of 40 Tejas Mk1 jets ordered in 2006 and 2010, only 38 have been delivered so far. The Tejas Mk1A, expected earlier, will see its first two deliveries in October after a two-year delay caused by late procurement of F404 engines from GE Aerospace and issues in weapons and radar integration. HAL now plans to manufacture 16 aircraft annually, but even then, deliveries may extend into the mid-2030s, beyond the original 2030 target.

India\u2019s Urban Blind Spot: Why Census Definitions Need Change Sept. 26, 2025 Why in news? The Registrar General of India has proposed retaining the 2011 Census definition of urban areas for Census 2027, ensuring comparability and consistency in analysing urbanisation trends. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Criteria for Urban Classification Global Comparisons Limitations of Current Urban Definition Implications of Outdated Urban Definition Criteria for Urban Classification In 2011, an urban unit was defined as either: Statutory Towns \u2013 formally notified by State governments with urban local bodies such as municipal corporations, municipal councils, or nagar panchayats. Census Towns \u2013 settlements meeting three conditions: Population of at least 5,000 At least 75% of the male main working population engaged in non-agricultural activities Population density of at least 400 persons per sq. km By these criteria, only 31.2% of India is considered urban, though the actual extent is believed to be much higher. Though census towns are administratively rural, they function like urban areas, creating a gap between governance and ground realities. Global Comparisons Unlike India\u2019s strict three-criteria approach, most countries rely on one or two measures such as demographics, density, or infrastructure. The World Bank\u2019s Agglomeration Index estimated that 55.3% of India\u2019s population lived in urban-like areas in 2010, showing \u201chidden urbanisation\u201d outside statutory limits. DEGURBA: A Global Framework To harmonise global urban definitions, six international organisations developed the Degree of Urbanisation (DEGURBA) method, endorsed by the UN in 2020. It uses satellite imagery and population grids of 1 km\u00b2. Settlements are classified into seven sub-categories: urban centres, dense/semi-dense clusters, peri-urban, and various rural categories. This approach captures the real spatial extent of urbanisation beyond administrative boundaries. DEGURBA helps detect settlement patterns, improve service monitoring, and guide financial targeting. However, its low-density thresholds may misclassify croplands or peri-urban fringes as urban. As it relies on algorithms and satellite data, risks of under- or over-detection remain. Limitations of Current Urban Definition India\u2019s binary definition of urban and rural fails to capture the complex realities of evolving settlements. While urban local bodies enjoy autonomy and better governance, Panchayati Raj institutions are limited, leaving many fast-urbanising areas under inadequate rural administration. Villages transforming into towns often remain unrecognised , despite dense populations, non-agricultural livelihoods, and urban lifestyles. As a result, census towns and peri-urban regions are excluded from proper governance and infrastructure, creating gaps in planning and services. For example, Census data show that 251 towns identified as urban in 2001 continued to be governed as rural areas even in 2011. West Bengal, with the highest rise in census towns, illustrates this mismatch, as many newly classified urban settlements were never converted into statutory towns with elected bodies, leaving them underprepared for infrastructure and planning needs. Implications of Outdated Urban Definition As India prepares for Census 2027, retaining the old definition of \u201curban\u201d risks undercounting millions and excluding rapidly growing settlements from governance and services. Studies show India\u2019s true urban population in 2011 may have been 35\u201357%, much higher than the official 31%. The rigid rules \u2014 such as the 75% male workforce engaged in non-agricultural jobs \u2014 are outdated , ignoring women\u2019s informal work and the rise of industries, service jobs, and gig economy employment in semi-urban and rural areas. Many settlements that function as urban clusters remain unrecognised because they fall outside municipal boundaries or are divided administratively. Seasonal workers who straddle agriculture and urban jobs also fall through the cracks. Thus, continuing with the narrow, binary definition will misclassify urbanisation trends, leaving infrastructure, planning, and services ill-suited to India\u2019s evolving settlement India\u2019s Urban Blind Spot - Why Census Definitions Need Change.pdf ( Size: 547.6 KB ) Latest Article See All IndiGo Meltdown Dec. 5, 2025, 2:34 p.m. Economics India to Expand Its Busiest Rail Corridors: What\u2019s Planned Dec. 5, 2025, 2:08 p.m. Economics Census 2027 - Counting India, Renewing the Republic Dec. 5, 2025, 1:54 p.m. Editorial Analysis Health and National Security Cess on Demerit Goods Dec. 5, 2025, 1:48 p.m. Economics A Missing Link in India\u2019s Mineral Mission Dec. 5, 2025, 1:33 p.m. Editorial Analysis A Day to Pause and Come Down to Earth Dec. 5, 2025, 1:27 p.m. Editorial Analysis Rupee Breaches the 90-Mark Dec. 4, 2025, 1:36 p.m. Economics Putin\u2019s Visit: India\u2013Russia Ties and the Road Ahead Dec. 4, 2025, 1:24 p.m. International Relati", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

Climate activist Sonam Wangchuk, leading the movement for Ladakh\u2019s statehood and Sixth Schedule protections, was detained under the National Security Act (NSA) and shifted to Jodhpur jail . The Centre blamed him for allegedly instigating violent protests in Leh, where four people were killed in police firing and 50 injured. The case has drawn attention to the NSA , one of India\u2019s toughest preventive detention laws, used in the past against separatists, gangsters, and radical preachers . The law allows governments to pre-emptively detain individuals deemed a threat to public order or national security. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? About Preventive Detention Preventive Detention and the NSA What the NSA Provides Wangchuk\u2019s Legal Remedies Past Use and Misuse of the NSA About Preventive Detention Preventive detention is the practice of detaining a person not for a crime already committed, but to prevent them from acting in a manner that could threaten public order, security, or essential supplies. It aims to stop potential harm before it occurs. Difference from Punitive Detention Preventive detention : Detains individuals to prevent a future act considered harmful. It is anticipatory in nature. Punitive detention : Imposed as punishment after conviction for an offence already committed, based on due process of law. Constitutional Provision The Indian Constitution permits preventive detention under Article 22 . Article 22 has two parts\u2014the first part deals with cases of ordinary law, which includes situations where an individual is detained as part of a criminal investigation. The second part deals with cases of preventive detention law, which pertains to the detention of individuals without a trial or conviction. A person can be detained up to 3 months without Advisory Board approval; beyond that, detention requires approval by an Advisory Board of judges. Grounds of detention must be communicated, but certain facts may be withheld in public interest. Preventive Detention and the NSA Preventive detention in India traces back to colonial times and was institutionalised post-Independence through the Preventive Detention Act, 1950 . It was followed by the controversial Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA), 1971 , repealed after the Emergency. In 1980, the National Security Act (NSA) was enacted, empowering the Centre, states, District Magistrates, and Police Commissioners (when authorised) to detain individuals pre-emptively. Unlike punitive arrests under criminal law, NSA detention is preventive , aimed at stopping individuals from acting in ways \u201cprejudicial to India\u2019s defence, foreign relations, national security, public order, or essential supplies.\u201d The Act gives governments wide-ranging powers to address threats, while incorporating certain procedural safeguards to check misuse. What the NSA Provides? Under NSA, detention orders function like warrants of arrest, allowing authorities to hold individuals in designated places, transfer them across states, and impose conditions. Grounds of detention must be communicated within 5 to 15 days, and detainees can submit a representation to the government. An Advisory Board of High Court judges must review the case within 3 weeks and order release if there is \u201cno sufficient cause.\u201d Detention can last up to 12 months, though it may be revoked earlier. However, safeguards are limited: detainees cannot have legal representation before the Advisory Board, and the government may withhold facts citing public interest, leaving significant powers in official hands. Wangchuk\u2019s Legal Remedies Sonam Wangchuk can challenge his detention under the NSA by filing a representation to the government or await the Advisory Board\u2019s review within three weeks, which must order release if no sufficient cause is found. He may also approach the High Court or Supreme Court under Articles 226 or 32 to contest the legality of detention. Additionally, the government itself may revoke the order at any stage. Until these processes conclude, the NSA permits detention without formal charges or open-court evidence, giving authorities wide leeway in holding him. Past Use and Misuse of the NSA The NSA has been invoked in several high-profile cases. In 2023, radical Sikh preacher Amritpal Singh was detained under NSA and moved to Dibrugarh jail. Earlier, Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad was booked in 2017, though the order was later revoked by the Supreme Court. During the anti-CAA protests (2020), multiple protesters in Uttar Pradesh were detained under the Act. The law has also targeted individuals such as Dr Kafeel Khan, whose 2020 detention was struck down by the Allahabad High Court. States like Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh have applied NSA in \u201cLove Jihad\u201d cases, communal violence, cow slaughter, and habitual crime, often stretching its definition of nation", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

The Turmoil in Kathmandu, the Road Ahead for Nepal Sept. 27, 2025 Context The political turmoil in Nepal following the Gen Z protests of September 2025 marks a significant turning point in South Asia\u2019s democratic landscape. Unlike previous uprisings in Nepal that were largely steered by political parties, this movement was spearheaded by the younger generation , frustrated with systemic corruption, elite domination, and lack of economic opportunities. The resignation of Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli, the swearing-in of former Chief Justice Sushila Karki as interim Prime Minister , and the dissolution of parliament reflect both the fragility and resilience of Nepal\u2019s democratic framework. Placed against the backdrop of wider regional unrest across South Asia in the 2020s, Nepal\u2019s transition underscores broader themes of generational change , institutional weakness, and the struggle for political legitimacy. Regional Context of Turbulence The upheavals in Nepal cannot be examined in isolation and the wider South Asian region has experienced a wave of political instability throughout the decade. Myanmar reverted to military rule in 2021 ; Afghanistan fell to the Taliban the same year; Sri Lanka\u2019s Aragalaya protests of 2022 toppled President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Also, Pakistan witnessed widespread protests in 2023 following the arrest of Imran Khan; and Bangladesh\u2019s Sheikh Hasina resigned under pressure in 2024. Although these events share common threads , particularly the role of disillusioned youth and high youth unemployment, each country\u2019s crisis stems from its unique political trajectory. Myanmar and Pakistan remain dominated by their militaries , Afghanistan continues its cycle of failed foreign interventions, while Sri Lanka and Bangladesh suffered from entrenched dynastic rule. In all cases, however, young populations have emerged as catalysts of change, challenging authoritarianism, corruption, and political inertia. Nepal\u2019s Distinctive Path Nepal\u2019s political journey diverges from its neighbours in significant ways. Since the 1990 Jan Aandolan , which curtailed monarchical powers and introduced multi-party democracy, Nepal has seen frequent government changes , seven since the adoption of the 2015 constitution alone. This apparent instability masked deeper continuity : the same handful of leaders, from Oli to Prachanda to Sher Bahadur Deuba, repeatedly rotated in office, entrenching corruption and stalling economic growth. The Maoist insurgency (1996\u20132006 ) and subsequent peace process transformed Nepal into a republic in 2008, but the promise of stable, inclusive governance has not been realised. Instead , the 2025 protests reflect a rejection not just of a government , but of an entire political class perceived as self-serving and unaccountable. The Interim Government and its Challenges The intervention of the army in facilitating talks and ensuring security , along with President Ramchandra Paudel\u2019s reliance on military mediation, underscores the fragility of civilian political authority in Nepal. The appointment of Sushila Karki as interim Prime Minister marks a cautious step towards restoring stability. Her three stated priorities, ensuring elections on March 5, 2026; investigating police excesses and protest violence ; and tackling high-level corruption, are ambitious yet fraught with difficulty. Nepal\u2019s judicial system lacks mechanisms for fast-track prosecutions, and political gangs infiltrating the protests complicate accountability. More significantly, calls for constitutional amendments risk destabilising the fragile consensus built since 2006. Proposals to abolish federalism or alter proportional representation would alienate marginalised groups such as the Madhesis, Janjatis, and Tharus, potentially reigniting ethnic tensions. Youth, Democracy, and the Question of Legitimacy At the heart of Nepal\u2019s crisis lies a generational divide . Youth unemployment, exceeding 20%, fuels resentment against a political elite seen as benefiting from cronyism while ignoring structural reforms. The Gen Z protests highlight a hunger for new political platforms , but the challenge remains whether these movements can institutionalise themselves into coherent parties capable of governing. The upcoming elections provide both opportunity and risk . Established parties require time to undergo internal renewal, which veteran leaders may resist. At the same time, new youth-led forces may struggle with organisation , while pro-monarchy factions could attempt to exploit disillusionment. Thus, the March 2026 elections will be a critical test of whether Nepal can transition from protest-driven change to durable democratic renewal. India\u2019s Role and Regional Implications India, often accused of meddling in Nepal\u2019s affairs, has so far responded with restraint. Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s congratulatory call to Sushila Karki signalled goodwill without overt interference.

The Jharkhand archery team has been named \u201cChero Archers\u201d in the inaugural Archery Premier League (APL), paying tribute to the legendary Chero warrior clan known for their defiance against the Mughals and British. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Chero Clan (Introduction, Historical Overview, Archery in Jharkhand, etc.) News Summary About Chero Warrior Clan: A Historical Overview The Cheros were a warrior community that rose to prominence in the medieval period. Predominantly found in Palamu (Jharkhand), Shahabad (Bihar), and parts of eastern Uttar Pradesh , they were known for their courage, skill with bows and arrows, and their ability to defend their territories against external forces. Resistance against the Mughals During the 16th and 17th centuries, the Cheros fiercely resisted Mughal expansion in eastern India. Palamu, under the rule of Chero King Medini Rai , became a symbol of defiance. Medini Rai fortified the Palamu forts and challenged Mughal armies led by generals under Emperor Aurangzeb. Although the forts were eventually captured, the Cheros\u2019 resistance highlighted their martial spirit and determination to remain independent. Defiance against British Colonial Rule The Cheros were equally hostile toward British colonial expansion. In the late 18 th and early 19 th centuries, they joined forces with other tribal communities like the Santhals, Mundas, and Oraons in rebellions against British land revenue policies and forest exploitation. Their familiarity with the rugged terrain of Jharkhand and mastery of archery made them formidable guerrilla fighters. Symbol of Tribal Identity Over time, the Cheros came to represent resistance, valour, and identity for Jharkhand\u2019s tribal population. Their martial traditions have been celebrated in folklore, songs, and oral histories passed down through generations. Archery in Jharkhand: A Natural Legacy Archery has always been more than a sport for Jharkhand\u2019s tribal communities. It has been a way of life, a survival skill, and a cultural practice. Traditional Significance: For centuries, bows and arrows were used for hunting and self-defence in the forests of Jharkhand. Sporting Excellence: Jharkhand has produced some of India\u2019s finest archers, including Deepika Kumari and Komalika Bari , who rose from humble tribal backgrounds to international fame. Grassroots Training: Many villages in Jharkhand continue to train young children in archery using bamboo bows, symbolising both tradition and aspiration. By naming its team the Chero Archers , Jharkhand has merged this ancient martial practice with modern sporting aspirations, ensuring that the legacy of the warrior clan finds renewed relevance in today\u2019s context. News Summary The Archery Premier League (APL) is India\u2019s newest sporting initiative, modelled on the franchise system that has boosted cricket and kabaddi. Jharkhand\u2019s franchise, named Chero Archers , is not only a nod to the State\u2019s dominance in archery but also a deliberate cultural assertion. Tribute to Warrior Heritage: The team\u2019s name commemorates the Chero warrior clan, whose martial legacy continues to inspire pride in the region. Promoting Cultural Identity: By associating the team with the Cheros, Jharkhand is strengthening its tribal narrative in a national sporting arena. Boost to Sports Tourism: The APL is expected to attract attention to Jharkhand\u2019s rich history and its tradition of producing world-class archers. Empowering Youth: The initiative provides an opportunity for tribal youth to connect with their heritage while pursuing sporting excellence at the professional level. This symbolic gesture resonates deeply with Jharkhand\u2019s population, where history and modernity are often woven together in narratives of struggle and achievement. Significance of the Move Cultural Revival: The move ensures that the memory of Chero warriors is not confined to history books but celebrated in a contemporary context. Sports and Identity: It bridges the gap between traditional tribal identity and modern sports culture, making archery both a cultural and professional aspiration.

India Successfully Tests Agni-Prime Missile from Rail-Based Launcher Sept. 26, 2025 Why in news? The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) successfully test-fired the Agni-Prime (Agni-P) missile from a rail-based mobile launcher . This launch has placed India among a select group of nations \u2014 Russia, the US, China, and possibly North Korea \u2014 with the capability to launch long-range ballistic missiles from railway platforms using canisterised launch systems . What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Agni Series of Missiles Agni-P: The Next-Generation Upgrade to Agni-I Mobile Launch Platforms and India\u2019s Second-Strike Capability Advantages of Rail-Based Missile Launchers Countries with Rail-Based Missile Technology Agni Series of Missiles The Agni series is India\u2019s family of nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, developed under the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) by the DRDO. They are a key element of India\u2019s strategic deterrence capability. Agni-I (1989): A medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) with a range of 700\u20131,000 km. It was India\u2019s first in the series and is road- and rail-mobile. Agni-II (1999): A two-stage solid-fuel missile with a range of 2,000\u20133,000 km, capable of carrying nuclear warheads. Agni-III (2006): An intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) with a range of 3,500\u20135,000 km, providing wider regional coverage. Agni-IV (2011): Improved navigation and accuracy, range of 3,500\u20134,000 km, lighter and more advanced than Agni-III. Agni-V (2012): An intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) with a range of 5,000\u20138,000 km, extending India\u2019s deterrence to cover much of Asia and parts of Europe and Africa. Agni-P (Agni-Prime, 2021): A next-generation variant with a range of 1,000\u20132,000 km, combining advanced technologies from Agni-IV and V, lighter, more accurate, and canisterised. Agni-VI (under development): Expected range of 8,000\u201310,000 km, with potential multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle (MIRV) capability. Agni-P: The Next-Generation Upgrade to Agni-I India\u2019s Agni missile series, developed since the late 1980s, began with the Agni-I medium range ballistic missile (700\u20131,000 km range) tested in 1989. While Agni-I remains in service, defence planners sought upgrades, leading to the development of Agni-P (Agni-Prime) . Agni-P combines Agni-I\u2019s range with advanced propulsion and navigation technologies from Agni-IV and Agni-V. It is the sixth missile in the Agni series. Weighing 11,000 kg, it is a two-stage, solid-fuel missile with an operational range of 1,000\u20132,000 km , capable of carrying high explosive, thermobaric, or nuclear warheads . A nuclear-capable version tested in 2021 drew praise from the then Defence Minister, who said it would further bolster India\u2019s Credible Deterrence capabilities . Mobile Launch Platforms and India\u2019s Second-Strike Capability Mobile launch systems are vital to a nation\u2019s second-strike capability , enabling it to retaliate after a nuclear attack. For India, which follows a \u201cno first use\u201d nuclear doctrine , such survivability is critical. Advances in satellite imagery, missile accuracy, and sensing technologies have made stationary silos increasingly vulnerable. As noted by defence experts, silos face heightened risks from both conventional and nuclear strikes. To counter this, militaries rely on mobile launch platforms \u2014 submarines, aircraft, and road or rail-based launchers \u2014 which are harder to detect and more resilient in an all-out conflict. Advantages of Rail-Based Missile Launchers Rail-based missile platforms offer distinct advantages over road or sea systems. While road-based launchers are constrained by road width and quality, India\u2019s 70,000-km railway network enables nationwide mobility without major preparation. The numerous railway tunnels provide natural hiding spots, allowing launchers to evade enemy satellite surveillance and remain concealed until deployment. Compared to submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) , rail-based platforms are also cheaper to build and maintain , making them a more efficient and scalable option for strengthening strategic deterrence. Countries with Rail-Based Missile Technology India\u2019s recent test places it among a select group of nations with rail-based missile launch capability. The idea dates back to the Cold War , when both the US and USSR explored rail-mobile ICBMs. The US studied rail launchers for its Minuteman ICBMs in the 1950s and again planned Peacekeeper deployment in the 1980s, but abandoned both due to cost and the Soviet collapse. The Soviet Union successfully deployed the RT-23 Molodets rail-based ICBM system, later dismantled under the START Treaty . Russia later considered reviving the concept with the Barguzin system but shelved it in favour of hypersonic missile development. In 2016, China reportedly tested a rail-mobile version of its DF-41 ICBM. North Korea has also tested rail-based short-range ballistic ", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

The CAG\u2019s decadal analysis of States\u2019 macro-fiscal health highlights uneven revenue sources, rising debt burdens, and the welfare paradox shaping fiscal sustainability across India. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? CAG Report (Introduction, States\u2019 Macro-Fiscal Landscape, Revenue Sources, Rising Borrowings, Welfare Paradox, Implications, etc.) Introduction India\u2019s States collectively manage some of the largest public budgets in the world, often surpassing those of smaller countries in size. The recently released decadal analysis of States\u2019 macro-fiscal health by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) offers a crucial snapshot of how reforms, growth, and crises such as the pandemic have shaped their fiscal trajectories. While some States reported impressive revenue surpluses, others struggle under heavy debt burdens, revealing stark disparities in fiscal sustainability and policy choices. States\u2019 Macro-Fiscal Landscape in India In the early 2000s, Indian States were burdened with chronic deficits. Reforms in tax collection, GST implementation, and high growth during the 2010s improved finances, with some States recording surpluses. However, the pandemic reversed these gains, as shrinking revenues and soaring emergency expenditure pushed most States back into fiscal distress. States today present a mixed picture : while richer States like Maharashtra fund a large share of their expenditure internally, poorer States such as Arunachal Pradesh remain highly dependent on Union transfers. This vertical imbalance in fiscal capacity underscores the unevenness of India\u2019s federal fiscal architecture. Uneven Revenue Sources The CAG report shows that States rely on highly variable revenue streams. For example: Kerala\u2019s lotteries contributed nearly Rs. 12,000 crore in 2022-23. Odisha\u2019s mining royalties made up 90% of its non-tax income. Telangana raised nearly Rs. 9,800 crore through land sales. Such revenues are volatile and unsustainable: lotteries depend on sales, royalties on global commodity prices, and land cannot be sold repeatedly. Even surplus-earning States like Uttar Pradesh generated only 42% of their receipts internally , leaning heavily on central transfers. Rising Borrowings and Debt Burden The fiscal health of States is also reflected in their borrowing patterns: Andhra Pradesh tripled its borrowings to Rs. 1.86 lakh crore by 2022-23, with debt reaching 35% of GSDP. Bihar doubled its borrowings, pushing debt close to 39% of GSDP. Kerala\u2019s debt burden remained high at 37% of GSDP despite curbing borrowings post-pandemic. Punjab continued its fiscal stress with liabilities touching 45% of GSDP. In contrast, Odisha reduced borrowings , lowering debt to 15% of GSDP, the lowest in India. The pandemic was a turning point: while some States like Karnataka and Maharashtra cut back borrowings after 2021, others like Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Rajasthan kept expanding them, signalling divergent fiscal strategies. The Welfare Paradox A striking theme of the CAG analysis is the welfare paradox . Despite reporting surpluses or stable debt, many States underfund key welfare sectors such as education, health, and rural infrastructure. Instead, reliance on off-budget loans, GST compensation arrears, and central transfers creates a fa\u00e7ade of fiscal stability. Political populism adds another layer. Free power, farm waivers, and cash transfers defer costs into opaque mechanisms like guarantees and special-purpose vehicles. Implications for Fiscal Federalism The CAG findings highlight deeper structural issues in India\u2019s fiscal federalism: Dependence on volatile revenues limits the States\u2019 capacity to plan long-term welfare. Rising borrowings pose risks of debt overhang, especially in poorer and smaller States. Vertical fiscal imbalance perpetuates reliance on the Centre, undermining financial autonomy. Populist welfare policies erode fiscal discipline while failing to deliver sustainable outcomes. The analysis suggests that India\u2019s States must prioritise capital expenditure over routine subsidies , diversify revenue sources, and strengthen fiscal transparency. Without such reforms, India risks sustaining one of the largest welfare States in the world on one of the thinnest fiscal bases among middle-income economies. Conclusion The CAG\u2019s decadal review underscores the complexity of States\u2019 macro-fiscal health. While some States like Odisha demonstrate prudent fiscal management, others, such as Punjab and Kerala, remain vulnerable to debt traps and volatile revenues. The welfare paradox, lavish spending amid weak revenues, reflects the tension between developmental needs and fiscal sustainability. For India\u2019s federal system to remain resilient, States must pursue balanced fiscal strategies that combine growth, welfare, and sustainability . newspaper.pdf ( Size: 563.3 KB ) Latest Article See All IndiGo Me", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

The government has launched guidelines under the Rs. 10,000 crore PM E-Drive scheme, offering 100% subsidy for EV charging infrastructure to accelerate India\u2019s transition to clean mobility. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? PM E-Drive Scheme (Introduction, Key Features, Impact on Ecosystem, Challenges, etc.) Introduction India has set ambitious targets for transitioning towards sustainable transportation, with electric vehicles (EVs) positioned at the centre of its clean mobility vision. To bridge the critical infrastructure gap, the government has rolled out guidelines under the Rs. 10,000 crore PM E-Drive scheme , offering up to 100% subsidy for setting up EV charging stations and battery swapping stations. The move aims to accelerate EV adoption by addressing one of the sector\u2019s biggest challenges, inadequate charging infrastructure. India\u2019s Push for EV Adoption The EV sector in India has gained momentum over the past decade, supported by policies such as the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme and state-level incentives. However, the lack of sufficient charging points continues to deter buyers. India currently has fewer than 20,000 public charging stations, far behind global EV leaders like China and the U.S. The PM E-Drive scheme seeks to address this bottleneck by prioritising subsidies for high-density urban areas, smart cities, and critical transport corridors. By linking subsidies to demand aggregation, the scheme ensures a coordinated approach between ministries, state governments, and public sector enterprises. Key Features of the PM E-Drive Subsidy Scheme The new guidelines allocate Rs. 2,000 crore out of the Rs. 10,000 crore scheme exclusively for charging infrastructure. Some of the notable features include: 100% Subsidy Coverage : Eligible entities will receive full financial support for upstream infrastructure like transformers, cables, circuit breakers, and civil works. In some cases, even the cost of EV supply equipment (EVSE), including charging guns, will be subsidised. Priority Areas : Focus on cities with populations above one million, notified smart cities, satellite towns near metros, and cities under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP). Highways Integration : Selected inter-city and inter-state highways will be made EV-ready through coordinated planning with the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. Eligible Entities : Central ministries, State governments, PSUs, and CPSEs can submit proposals. Companies like IOCL, BPCL, HPCL, NHAI, AAI, and metro rail corporations are also eligible. Operational Flexibility : Entities may directly operate charging stations or appoint Charge Point Operators (CPOs). Expected Impact on EV Ecosystem The subsidy scheme is designed to create a network of charging stations that matches the pace of EV adoption in India. The immediate benefits include: Boost to EV Sales : Assured availability of charging infrastructure is expected to encourage more consumers to switch from internal combustion engine vehicles to EVs. Public Sector Leadership : Involving large PSUs such as IOCL and NHAI ensures that the scheme benefits from established networks and infrastructure expertise. Pollution Reduction : By prioritising NCAP cities and capital cities, the scheme aligns EV infrastructure growth with India\u2019s clean air goals. Economic Opportunities : The expansion of charging networks will create business opportunities for Charge Point Operators, equipment manufacturers, and service providers. Challenges Ahead While the subsidy plan is a breakthrough, its success will depend on implementation. Some key challenges include: Land Acquisition : Identifying and securing suitable sites for charging stations in densely populated urban areas. Grid Readiness : Strengthening India\u2019s power distribution systems to handle increased EV charging load without causing disruptions. Private Sector Participation : Encouraging private players to complement PSU-led efforts for a balanced rollout. Consumer Awareness : Educating users about charging locations, pricing models, and safety standards.

South-South and Triangular Cooperation is More Than a Diplomatic Phrase Sept. 30, 2025 Context With only a third of the time left before the 2030 deadline for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) , the urgency of reimagining global cooperation has never been more pressing. Among the most promising frameworks for collective progress is South-South and Triangular Cooperation (SSTC), an approach rooted in solidarity, mutual respect, and shared learning. First formalised through the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA) in 1978 , SSTC has evolved into a vital mechanism for development, offering cost-effective, replicable, and contextually relevant solutions in a rapidly changing global landscape. The Evolution and Relevance of SSTC Unlike traditional aid models, SSTC operates on principles of equality and mutual benefit , enabling developing nations to learn from one another\u2019s experiences. Its importance has grown in an era defined by geopolitical instability , climate change, and widening inequality. By amplifying the strengths of developing countries and pooling resources, SSTC provides more sustainable and scalable solutions at a time when funding for humanitarian and development efforts is shrinking. Triangular cooperation further expands this framework by connecting developing nations with traditional donors, emerging economies, civil society, and the private sector. This diversified partnership approach enhances accountability, trust, and inclusivity, resulting in development models that are people-centred and resilient. India\u2019s Philosophy and Leadership in SSTC India\u2019s development philosophy is anchored in Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, the idea that the world is one family. This ethos informs its role as a key driver of SSTC , where it combines moral leadership with practical innovation. India has consistently positioned itself as an advocate for sovereignty, inclusion, and multilateral cooperation. Concrete contributions highlight India\u2019s leadership: Global advocacy and diplomacy: Hosting the Voice of the Global South Summits and pushing for permanent African Union membership in the G20. Institutional mechanisms: Establishing the Development Partnership Administration and implementing the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) programme, which has trained professionals in over 160 countries. Financial support: Launching the India-UN Development Partnership Fund, which has financed over 75 projects across 56 countries. Technological innovation: Sharing digital public infrastructure models like Aadhaar and UPI, alongside advancements in climate resilience, healthcare, and sustainable financing. India and the World Food Programme: A Model of Innovation India\u2019s collaboration with the World Food Programme (WFP) provides a striking example of how SSTC can generate scalable solutions. Over six decades, this partnership has produced innovations that improved India\u2019s food security and now serve as models for other nations. Notable initiatives include: Annapurti (Grain ATMs) for efficient food distribution. Optimised national supply chains for the public distribution system. Women-led Take-Home Ration programmes improving nutrition at scale. National rice fortification projects enhancing dietary quality. These interventions exemplify how localised innovation can achieve global relevance , offering replicable models for countries facing similar challenges. Financing and Scaling SSTC Sustained progress requires strong institutions and predictable financing . Encouragingly, contributions to SSTC have steadily grown. In the past three decades, 47 governments have supported the UN Fund for South-South Cooperation, benefitting people in 155 countries. The India-UN Fund has further extended these efforts, particularly in Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS). In 2024 alone, the WFP mobilised over $10.9 million from Global South countries and the private sector for SSTC projects targeting Zero Hunger (SDG 2) . Initiatives like rice fortification in Nepal and development projects in Lao PDR demonstrate the tangible outcomes of these partnerships. The Way Forward: Towards a Renewed Spirit of Partnership The 2025 theme for UN Day for South-South and Triangular Cooperation , New Opportunities and Innovation through SSTC, captures the pressing need to invest in creativity, knowledge-sharing, and institutional strength. The challenges ahead demand not only technical solutions but also a new spirit of partnership grounded in equality, innovation, and mutual accountability. SSTC is not merely a diplomatic instrument ; it is a transformative pathway. By valuing contributions from all nations, nurturing innovation, and prioritising the needs of communities, it can drive progress towards a more equitable and sustainable global future. Conclusion The trajectory of SSTC illustrates how solidarity among developing nations can generate lasting gl", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}
{"id": "f6e8c9dc-bf32-498a-ba21-af27d6581a9b", "text": "Home / Mains Articles / An Anti-Terror Role Th... An Anti-Terror Role That Defies Logic Sept. 30, 2025 Context The global fight against terrorism is often portrayed as a unified front , spearheaded by international bodies such as the United Nations (UN). Yet recent developments have exposed troubling contradictions at the heart of this struggle. Pakistan, a country long accused of sponsoring and sheltering terrorist organisations, has been granted leadership positions within the very UN committees designed to combat terrorism. This paradox not only undermines the credibility of the UN but also poses serious risks to regional and global security. Pakistan\u2019s Terror Infrastructure For decades, Pakistan has been accused of nurturing terrorism as a tool of state policy. From harbouring Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, just a short distance from its military academy, to providing direct support for groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT ) and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), its role is well documented. High-profile incidents such as the 2008 Mumbai attacks , the 2019 Pulwama bombing, and the April 2025 Pahalgam attack highlight a sustained pattern of cross-border terrorism nurtured on Pakistani soil. India\u2019s response to the latest attack , Operation Sindoor, underscored the entrenched nature of this terror infrastructure. Further evidence came from the presence of Pakistani officials at the funerals of slain militants , demonstrating institutional complicity. The continuing prominence of UN-designated terrorists like Hafiz Saeed , who remains politically and socially active despite his supposed imprisonment, reinforces Pakistan\u2019s status as a terror shelter. The UN\u2019s Contradictory Decisions Against this backdrop, Pakistan\u2019s elevation to leadership roles in the UN\u2019s counter-terrorism mechanisms is deeply troubling. In June 2025, Pakistan was appointed to chair the Taliban Sanctions Committee and serve as vice-chair of the Counter-Terrorism Committee. By July, it even assumed the rotating presidency of the UN Security Council . These decisions echo earlier controversies, such as Libya chairing the Human Rights Commission or Saudi Arabia leading the Women\u2019s Rights Commission. Four key issues emerge: Contradiction of Mandates: Pakistan\u2019s sponsorship of terror groups directly violates the objectives of the UN committees it now leads. Weak Vetting Standards: Its removal from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list in 2022 despite ongoing concerns about terror financing reflects systemic leniency. Geopolitical Bias: Major powers often prioritise strategic or economic interests over moral imperatives, enabling Pakistan\u2019s ascent. Dangerous Precedent: Rewarding duplicity legitimises state-sponsored terrorism and sends the message that diplomatic packaging can outweigh security realities. The situation was compounded when the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a $1 billion loan for Pakistan in May 2025 , sparking concerns that the funds might be diverted to sustain terror networks. Implications for India and Global Security The UN\u2019s decisions undermine India\u2019s efforts to highlight Pakistan as a state sponsor of terrorism. With a foothold in UN counter-terrorism bodies , Pakistan can shape global narratives , deflect accusations, and even obstruct sanctions against its proxy groups. It also gains leverage to weaken India\u2019s diplomatic engagement with the Taliban regime and project itself as a responsible international actor. For India, the challenge is twofold: neutralising Pakistan\u2019s diplomatic manoeuvres while simultaneously reinforcing its own security. Countermeasures must include: Leveraging alliances with UNSC members to balance Pakistan\u2019s influence. Highlighting Pakistan\u2019s terror links in global forums and pushing for stringent accountability. Deepening engagement with Afghanistan, including humanitarian aid missions, to reduce Pakistan\u2019s sway over the Taliban. Launching a global information campaign through media, academia, and diaspora networks to expose Pakistan\u2019s duplicity. Strengthening intelligence and cyber-security frameworks to mitigate asymmetric threats. The UN\u2019s Crisis of Integrity The UN\u2019s willingness to overlook Pakistan\u2019s terror links raises profound questions about its moral compass and credibility. By placing Pakistan in charge of counter-terrorism, the UN risks undermining its own authority, alienating victims of terrorism, and emboldening state sponsors of extremism. The appointment also reflects a larger pattern of selective morality in international governance, where political convenience trumps ethical consistency. Conclusion The paradox of Pakistan\u2019s elevation to UN counter-terrorism leadership illustrates the dangerous gap between rhetoric and reality in global governance. For India, the challenge lies not just in managing Pakistan\u2019s duplicity but also in ensuring that the international community recognises the threat such decisions pose to collective security.

Delhi CM Rekha Gupta announced that during cultural events like Ramlila and Durga Puja , loudspeaker use will be allowed till midnight , extending the usual 10 pm limit by two hours . The move aligns with legal provisions that permit state governments to relax loudspeaker restrictions during festivals and cultural occasions, while still operating within the framework of India\u2019s Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000 . What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Legal Framework Governing Loudspeakers in India Court Rulings on Loudspeaker Use in India Concerns Over Delhi\u2019s Loudspeaker Extension Legal Framework Governing Loudspeakers in India The Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000 , under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 , regulate the use of loudspeakers. Rule 5(1) requires written permission from authorities before use, while Rule 5(2) bans their use between 10 pm and 6 am , except in closed premises like auditoriums or conference halls. The rules prescribe maximum permissible noise levels for different areas , categorised as industrial, commercial, residential and silence zones. For residential areas, the daytime limit (6 am to 10 pm) is 55 decibels (dB) while that for nighttime is 45 dB. For context, a whisper is about 30 dB, while normal conversation is about 60 dB. Importantly, Rule 5(3) allows state governments to relax restrictions, permitting loudspeaker use till midnight for up to 15 days a year during cultural or religious festivities. Delhi\u2019s decision to extend the loudspeaker deadline for festivals falls within this legal provision. Court Rulings on Loudspeaker Use in India Over the past two decades, Indian courts have shaped a strong jurisprudence on noise pollution, balancing religious freedom with the fundamental right to a peaceful environment. Supreme Court: Loudspeakers Not a Fundamental Right In 2000, the Supreme Court ruled that no religion mandates prayers by disturbing others, rejecting the use of loudspeakers as a right under Article 25 (freedom of religion). In 2005, it further held that the right to a noise-free environment is implicit under Article 21, and \u201caural aggression\u201d cannot be justified under free speech. This ruling established the 10 pm\u20136 am loudspeaker ban. The Court upheld Rule 5(3) allowing exemptions till midnight for up to 15 days annually, but imposed strict conditions : only state governments can grant it, it must apply statewide, and silence zones remain excluded . High Court Directions High Courts have strictly enforced these principles: Bombay HC (2016): Loudspeakers not essential to religion; pulled up government for lax enforcement. Karnataka HC (2018): Allowed indoor concert use at night, provided boundary noise limits were respected. Punjab & Haryana HC (2019): Made written permission mandatory for all religious use, set up complaint mechanisms. Allahabad HC (2020): Azaan is essential, but loudspeakers are not historically required. Recent Ruling: Bombay HC (2025) The court introduced a graded penalty system : caution for first offence, fines for repeat, and seizure for continued violations. It also mandated considering cumulative noise levels from multiple sources and suggested modern enforcement, such as mobile decibel apps and auto-limiters in speakers . Concerns Over Delhi\u2019s Loudspeaker Extension Environmental experts criticised Delhi\u2019s decision to allow loudspeakers till midnight, calling it a backward step that undermines Noise Pollution Rules designed to protect children, patients, and residents. Activists warned that public health is being sacrificed for short-term convenience, noting that citizens already face excessive noise from construction and commercial establishments. In 2024, Delhi Police received over 40,000 noise complaints, with 82% linked to DJs and loudspeakers. This prompted fresh guidelines in March, requiring written permission for loudspeaker use and booking violators under Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita Sections 270, 292, and 293 . The amended order also tightened limits, mandating that private sound systems cannot exceed ambient noise standards by more than 5 dBA, compared to the earlier 10 dBA allowance.

The government\u2019s proposal to regulate air conditioner efficiency has reignited debate on the Right to Cooling as a public health and climate justice imperative in India and the Global South. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Access to Cooling (Introduction, India & Global South, Health Implications, Policy Interventions, Climate Justice, etc.) Introduction The intensifying heatwaves across the Global South , including India, have turned cooling into an essential public health safeguard rather than a luxury. In June 2025, the Government of India proposed regulations requiring all new air conditioners to function within a temperature range of 20\u00b0C to 28\u00b0C, with 24\u00b0C as the default setting. While the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) projects that such a move could save 20 billion units of electricity annually and cut emissions by 16 million tonnes, the debate extends far beyond efficiency. It raises urgent questions of equity, climate justice, and the universal right to cooling. Access to Cooling in India and the Global South Cooling access in India remains severely inadequate. In 2021, only 13% of urban households and 1% of rural households owned air conditioners, with overall national penetration at around 5%. The disparity is stark : Delhi reports 32% household ownership, while low-income states such as Bihar and Odisha report just 1% , despite recording extreme heat conditions. Globally, the contrast is sharper. Nearly 90% of households in the U.S. and Japan own an air conditioner, compared to 22% in Latin America and just 6% in Sub-Saharan Africa. Per capita electricity consumption for cooling in the U.S. is 28 times higher than in India. Despite these inequities, the discourse on cooling in the South is often framed as a climate burden, while in the North it is justified as a health necessity. Health and Productivity Implications Extreme heat is no longer just a climate phenomenon but a direct public health hazard . According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), heat exposure caused 489,000 global deaths between 2000 and 2019, with India recording over 20,000. The lack of reliable electricity, inadequate thermally secure housing, and under-equipped public health infrastructure amplify vulnerabilities. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) estimates that over 70% of the global workforce was exposed to excessive heat in 2020, causing 23 million occupational injuries and nearly 19,000 deaths. In India, where 80% of workers are in agriculture, construction, or street vending, the absence of heat-resilient workspaces threatens both health and livelihoods. Policy Interventions and Heat Action Plans Several Indian states and cities have initiated heat action plans , including early warning systems, public shelters, and awareness drives. However, weak institutional capacity, limited funding, and poor legal backing have restricted their effectiveness. Millions remain vulnerable to heat-related illnesses, productivity losses, and income insecurity. The government\u2019s regulatory approach to air conditioner efficiency is commendable for energy savings, but risks being symbolic if not paired with stronger investments in affordable cooling access for the vulnerable. Climate Justice and the Right to Cooling Developed countries historically invested heavily in heating systems, often backed by subsidies and unchecked emissions. Today, developing nations like India face a similar need for cooling but with fewer resources and under mounting international pressure to decarbonise. Global emissions from cooling stand at one billion tonnes annually, far lower than heating-related emissions, yet the cooling demand is projected to triple by 2050, with India\u2019s share growing eightfold. For the Global South, the challenge is twofold: achieving efficient cooling while ensuring universal access . Thus, cooling must be recognised not merely as a mitigation liability but as a development right tied to health, equity, and livelihood security. Bridging the gap requires financial and technological support from developed nations, large-scale public investment, and integration of cooling into climate adaptation strategies.

What an Empty Plate of Food Should Symbolise Sept. 29, 2025 Context Every year on September 29, the world observes the International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste (IDAFLW). Far from being symbolic, this occasion underscores a crisis that quietly undermines both global food security and climate stability. Nearly one-third of all food produced worldwide is either lost or wasted , representing not only a missed opportunity to nourish people but also an immense drain on natural resources. As one of the world\u2019s largest food producers, India faces this challenge acutely, with post-harvest losses imposing heavy economic, social, and environmental costs. The Scale of the Problem India\u2019s agricultural sector experiences substantial post-harvest losses across diverse crops and commodities. A 2022 study by NABCONS revealed that losses remain alarmingly high , cutting across fruits, vegetables, cereals, and livestock products. The economic toll is estimated at nearly \u20b91.5 trillion annually , equivalent to 3.7% of India\u2019s agricultural GDP. Fruits and vegetables are most at risk, with 10\u201315% spoilage rates, while even staples like wheat (4.2%) and paddy (4.8%) are far from immune. These figures translate into more than foregone nutrition; each tonne of food wasted reflects squandered water, energy, and labour. When scaled across India\u2019s vast production, millions of tonnes of food are lost annually, with grave implications for farmer incomes, national food availability, and climate stability. Food Loss and Climate Change Recent collaborative research by the FAO and NIFTEM , supported by the Green Climate Fund, quantified greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with post-harvest and retail waste across 30 crops and livestock products in India. Their findings were striking: modest percentage losses in cereals , particularly methane-intensive paddy, generate over 10 million tonnes of CO\u2082-equivalent emissions each year. Losses in livestock products, given their high resource footprint, compound the environmental burden. In total, food loss from these commodities contributes more than 33 million tonnes of CO\u2082-equivalent emissions annually. Unlike high-income countries where waste occurs primarily at the consumer end, India\u2019s food loss happens largely at early stages, handling, processing, and distribution. This points to systemic challenges: inadequate infrastructure, fragmented supply chains, and limited adoption of modern technologies. Pathways to Solutions Strengthening Infrastructure While the scale of India\u2019s food loss problem is daunting, solutions are within reach. Strengthening infrastructure is the cornerstone. Cold chains, encompassing pre-cooling facilities, refrigerated transport , and modern storage, are vital for perishables such as dairy, meat, fruits, and vegetables. Initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Kisan SAMPADA Yojana (PMKSY) are already working to modernise India\u2019s food logistics Affordable and Decentralized Technologies In addition to large-scale infrastructure, affordable and decentralised technologies can empower smallholders. Solar-powered cold storage units, low-cost cooling chambers, durable crates , and moisture-proof silos are practical tools to curb spoilage. Complementing these are digital innovations: IoT sensors, AI-driven forecasting, and mobile platforms such as FAO\u2019s Food Loss App (FLAPP), launched in 2023 and already used in over 30 countries, which help track and mitigate losses along the value chain. Foodbanks and Community Kitchens At the retail and consumer level, surplus food can be redirected to food banks and community kitchens, ensuring nutritional redistribution. Unavoidable waste can still serve productive purposes, being converted into compost, animal feed, or bioenergy. Realising these circular solutions, however, requires robust policy support , from subsidies and credit guarantees to incentives for private sector participation. Shared Responsibility Food loss is not a problem any single actor can solve in isolation . Governments must embed food loss reduction into national climate strategies and invest in resilient infrastructure. Businesses must adopt circular economic models and scale technological innovations. Civil society and academia can advance research and advocacy, while consumers must cultivate mindful practices to minimize waste and support redistribution efforts. Conclusion The observance of IDAFLW is more than a reminder , it is a call to collective action. India stands at a crossroads where tackling food loss is essential not only to secure nutrition for its people but also to meet its climate goals and conserve overstretched resources. Every meal saved represents not just sustenance but also a safeguard for ecosystems and livelihoods. In this light, an empty plate should never signify waste ; it should symbolise nourishment shared and resources preserved.

During renewed trade negotiations in New York, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal highlighted India\u2019s energy security vision, which will involve strong collaboration with the United States , especially in small modular reactor (SMR) technologies and broader nuclear energy cooperation. However, progress faces hurdles due to unresolved legal issues , particularly India\u2019s nuclear liability framework, which has long discouraged US firms from entering the Indian nuclear market. Addressing these liability concerns is essential but remains a complex challenge, making expansion in nuclear cooperation easier said than done. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? US Regulatory Clearance Boosts Indo-US Nuclear Prospects Key Amendments to India\u2019s Nuclear Liability Framework Opening India\u2019s Nuclear Sector to Private Participation Aligning India\u2019s Nuclear Laws with Global Norms Conclusion US Regulatory Clearance Boosts Indo-US Nuclear Prospects In March, the US Department of Energy (DoE) granted Holtec International regulatory clearance under the restrictive 10CFR810 rule , a long-standing hurdle in Indo-US nuclear cooperation. The approval conditionally permits Holtec to transfer unclassified small modular reactor (SMR) technology to its subsidiary Holtec Asia, as well as Indian firms Tata Consulting Engineers and Larsen & Toubro. Previously, 10CFR810 regulations barred US companies from manufacturing nuclear equipment or conducting nuclear design work in India, blocking New Delhi\u2019s aim to co-produce SMRs for domestic needs. The clearance removes this roadblock, paving the way for collaboration. Now, the onus shifts to India, which must pass pending legislative amendments \u2014 particularly to its liability law and the Atomic Energy Act \u2014 to unlock foreign investment. Key Amendments to India\u2019s Nuclear Liability Framework India is working on a set of 11 amendments to its Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act, 2010 (CLNDA) to attract foreign investment and ease vendor concerns. Section 17(b) \u2013 The Main Obstacle Section 17 of CLNDA allows nuclear plant operators to seek compensation from suppliers after paying damages for an accident . Specifically, Section 17(b) gives operators a \u201cright of recourse\u201d if an incident results from defective or substandard equipment supplied. Foreign vendors like Westinghouse Electric (US) and Framatome (France) argue this provision is stricter than global norms, exposing them to unlimited liability. Since its enactment, no foreign company has invested in India\u2019s nuclear projects, fearing financial risks. Even domestic sub-suppliers like L&T and Walchandnagar Industries are wary, as the term \u201csupplier\u201d is too broad and could include small vendors. Proposed Amendments The government is considering: Diluting Section 17(b) to bring it in line with international nuclear liability laws. Clarifying the definition of \u201csupplier \u201d to exclude sub-suppliers from automatic liability. Capping vendor liability , both in monetary terms (limited to contract value) and by time frame, so risks do not extend indefinitely. Regulatory Safeguards Officials note that the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) already vets all projects and can ensure right of recourse is explicitly written into contracts. This safeguard could balance accountability while easing investor fears. Opening India\u2019s Nuclear Sector to Private Participation India is preparing sweeping reforms to allow private and potentially foreign companies to participate in nuclear power generation \u2014 a sector long reserved for state-owned operators. Amendment to the Atomic Energy Act, 1962 The government plans to amend the Atomic Energy Act, 1962, which currently restricts nuclear plant operations to public sector entities like NPCIL and NTPC Ltd. The proposed reform would: Enable private firms to enter nuclear power generation. Allow for minority equity stakes by foreign companies in upcoming nuclear projects at a later stage. Expand the sector\u2019s capacity by leveraging private investment and technology. Link to Indo-US Civil Nuclear Deal Nearly two decades after the Indo-US civil nuclear agreement, these reforms are seen as crucial to unlocking its commercial potential. New Delhi also hopes to present this move as part of its broader trade and investment partnership with Washington, complementing ongoing India\u2013US trade negotiations. Aligning India\u2019s Nuclear Laws with Global Norms India is moving to amend its Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act (CLNDA) to align more closely with the 1997 Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (CSC) . These changes are aimed at easing investor concerns, clarifying ambiguities, and bringing India fully into the global nuclear liability regime. Compliance with the CSC India signed the CSC in 2010 and ratified it in 2016, despite not being a member of the Vienna (1963) or Paris (1960) Conven", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

The Cold Desert Biosphere Reserve in Himachal Pradesh has been included in UNESCO\u2019s World Network of Biosphere Reserves, making it India\u2019s 13th site on the global list . What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Cold Desert Reserve (Introduction, Biodiversity & Cultural Richness, Significance of Declaration, Future Outlook, etc.) Introduction In a significant recognition of India\u2019s conservation efforts, UNESCO has designated the Cold Desert Biosphere Reserve in Himachal Pradesh as part of its prestigious World Network of Biosphere Reserves (WNBR). This inclusion marks a global acknowledgement of the ecological, cultural, and scientific importance of the fragile Trans-Himalayan ecosystem. With this addition, India now has 13 biosphere reserves listed under UNESCO , highlighting the country\u2019s commitment to biodiversity protection and sustainable development. About the Cold Desert Biosphere Reserve The Cold Desert Biosphere Reserve spans 7,770 sq. km. across Himachal Pradesh\u2019s Lahaul-Spiti district . Situated at altitudes ranging from 3,300 to 6,600 meters, the region represents one of the coldest and driest ecosystems in the world. It covers landscapes such as windswept plateaus, glacial valleys, alpine lakes, and high-altitude deserts. The reserve integrates the Pin Valley National Park, Kibber Wildlife Sanctuary, Chandratal Wetland, and the Sarchu plains, making it a hub of biodiversity and cultural heritage. It is divided into three zones: core (2,665 sq. km), buffer (3,977 sq. km), and transition (1,128 sq. km), to balance conservation goals with sustainable community practices. Biodiversity and Cultural Richness The Cold Desert is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna. It harbours 732 vascular plant species, including 30 endemics and 47 medicinal herbs crucial to the traditional Sowa Rigpa (Amchi) healing system. Among its iconic fauna are the snow leopard , Himalayan ibex , blue sheep , Himalayan wolf , and several bird species like the golden eagle and Himalayan snowcock . Around 12,000 residents inhabit scattered villages across the reserve. They continue to practice traditional pastoralism, yak and goat herding, and small-scale farming of barley and peas. The communities also maintain ancient Tibetan herbal medicine traditions, often guided by Buddhist monasteries and local councils that regulate the use of alpine resources. Global and National Significance The UNESCO designation underscores the urgent need to protect fragile Himalayan ecosystems, which face mounting challenges from climate change and unchecked tourism. It also elevates Himachal\u2019s cold desert to global prominence, ensuring international cooperation in conservation, eco-tourism, and climate research. The recognition came during the 37th session of UNESCO\u2019s International Coordinating Council of the Man and the Biosphere (MAB) in Paris. Globally, UNESCO has added 26 new biosphere reserves across 21 countries this year, the highest number in two decades, expanding WNBR to 785 sites in 142 countries. India\u2019s Growing Biosphere Network With the addition of the Cold Desert Biosphere Reserve, India\u2019s tally of UNESCO-recognised biospheres has reached 13. This reflects the country\u2019s broader strategy to align conservation with sustainable community development. India\u2019s biospheres now include diverse ecosystems, from the Nilgiri and Sundarbans to the Great Nicobar and Pachmarhi. Union Environment Ministry noted that this achievement follows the inclusion of two new Ramsar sites in India, bringing the country\u2019s total wetlands of international importance to 93. The move reflects India\u2019s consistent push to integrate ecological preservation with international frameworks. Future Outlook The UNESCO recognition is expected to encourage greater research collaborations, promote responsible tourism, and improve climate resilience strategies in high-altitude ecosystems. It also calls attention to India\u2019s role in safeguarding fragile mountain landscapes that are both biodiversity hotspots and cultural treasures. The designation strengthens the global narrative of balancing conservation with community livelihoods, offering India an opportunity to showcase its traditional knowledge systems, pastoral practices, and eco-cultural heritage.

The Saudi-Pakistan Deal Upends India\u2019s Strategic Thought Sept. 26, 2025 Context The recent announcement of a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia has sent ripples across the subcontinent, particularly in India. At the core of the agreement lies a clause that treats aggression against one party as an attack on both , a formulation that echoes collective defence commitments. While such rhetoric has historical precedent in bilateral pacts , the timing, context, and wider geopolitical realignments have lent this deal far greater significance than a routine defence partnership. For India, which has invested heavily in deepening its engagement with West Asia over the past decade, the development underscores both the fragility of its strategic balancing act and the risks of complacency in an era of shifting alliances. India\u2019s Diplomatic Setback Post-Pahalgam Attack The agreement comes in the wake of the April 2025 terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir , which triggered the most intense military confrontation between India and Pakistan since the 1971 war. New Delhi responded with a concerted diplomatic campaign to isolate Pakistan internationally, alongside the launch of Operation Sindoor , aimed at striking terrorist camps within Pakistani territory. Yet, these efforts have yielded mixed results . While India received sympathy and support from some partners, its attempt to impose a diplomatic quarantine on Islamabad faltered. The Saudi-Pakistan pact, emerging amidst these tensions, represents a symbolic diplomatic victory for Islamabad and a clear rebuke of India\u2019s efforts to delegitimise its neighbour on the world stage. Riyadh\u2019s Balancing Act and Historical Context The move is not unprecedented and Saudi Arabia has long relied on Pakistan\u2019s military as a source of strategic depth , given Islamabad\u2019s extensive combat experience, largely against India, and its possession of nuclear weapons. The relationship, however, has not always been smooth. In 2015, Pakistan refused Riyadh\u2019s request to contribute troops to its Yemen campaign, straining ties significantly. Today, with Washington perceived as a less reliable security partner and with regional tensions heightened by conflicts such as the Israel-Hamas war of 2023 and the 12-day war between Israel and Iran , Riyadh appears to be recalibrating its security partnerships. The renewed embrace of Islamabad can be read as a return to tradition : a pragmatic convergence of Sunni solidarity, shared ideological roots, and hard-nosed military calculus. Geopolitical Reverberations Beyond South Asia While the immediate impact of the pact is felt in South Asia, its deeper resonance lies in West Asia\u2019s evolving strategic order . Since 2023, the region has been marked by volatility , with shifting alliances and new power equations emerging amid ongoing conflicts. Riyadh\u2019s decision to bind itself closer to Islamabad must be seen through its pursuit of strategic autonomy, multipolarity, and multi-alignment , principles that India too espouses in its foreign policy. Yet, as Saudi Arabia\u2019s choices demonstrate, these goals do not always align neatly with Indian interests . Instead, they may place New Delhi and Riyadh on opposing sides of regional fault lines. Implications for India\u2019s Strategic Thought For India, the pact is not an existential threat, but it is a warning sign . It underscores that New Delhi\u2019s engagement with West Asia, despite its visible expansion, cannot erase the deep-rooted ideological and religious bonds that tie Pakistan to Arab states. More crucially, it exposes the limits of India\u2019s risk-averse strategic culture . By clinging to an idealised self-image as a cautious, pacifist power, India risks falling behind in a rapidly transforming global order. The Pakistan-Saudi deal is less about military commitments and more about the symbolism of unity, the leveraging of disruptions in the global system, and the opportunism of weaker powers to punch above their weight. Conclusion It continues Riyadh\u2019s long tradition of engaging Islamabad as a security partner , while simultaneously rupturing India\u2019s narrative of having diplomatically cornered Pakistan. More broadly, it reflects the fragmentation of the post-Cold War order into a multipolar and unstable configuration where alignments are fluid, and symbolism often outweighs substance. For India, the lesson is sobering. If New Delhi fails to shed its strategic hesitation and embrace the risks inherent in great power politics, it risks ceding space to rivals who are more adept at exploiting global disorder.

While the Union government promotes local electronics manufacturing through initiatives like semiconductor fabs and the Electronics Component Manufacturing Scheme, e-waste recycling remains a weak link. Millions of tonnes of discarded consumer electronics and appliances have piled up in recent years. Policymakers see recycling as crucial to extract scarce and valuable metals, especially as electronics consumption is projected to surge in the coming years. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? E-Waste Electronics Consumption and Indigenous Push E-Waste Volumes and Processing Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Framework and Associated Concerns Future Potential E-Waste E-waste refers to discarded electronic devices such as smartphones, laptops, TVs, fridges, and chargers. While these often contain valuable materials, they are usually dumped instead of being reused or recycled. Need for effective e-waste management Health Risks - E-waste contains toxic substances like lead, mercury, and cadmium. Improper handling leads to contamination of soil and water, causing neurological disorders, kidney failure, and long-term chronic diseases. Environmental Damage - Hazardous recycling practices pollute air, soil, and water. They also release greenhouse gases, worsening climate change and harming ecosystems. Economic Loss - Inefficient recycling causes wastage of valuable resources such as gold, silver, and copper, which could otherwise be recovered and reused in production. Link with Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and SDGs E-waste management aligns with global sustainability frameworks: SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. SDG 13: Climate Action. It strengthens India\u2019s ESG commitments by integrating resource efficiency and environmental protection into growth. Electronics Consumption and Indigenous Push India, despite having over 93.9 crore mobile broadband connections, accounts for only 4 % of global electronics consumption . Fragile global supply chains have pushed the government to expand domestic manufacturing and raw material access, including a \u20b91,500 crore mineral recycling scheme announced in September. E-Waste Volumes and Processing According to the Global E-Waste Monitor 2020, India is the world\u2019s third-largest e-waste generator after China and the USA. With India being one of the fastest-growing electronics markets, this trend is expected to rise further. As per one report, India\u2019s electronics industry to grow at a CAGR of 16.6%, from USD 215 billion in FY19 to USD 540 billion by FY25. This rapid expansion will add significantly to e-waste volumes. India generated an estimated 4.17 million metric tonnes of e-waste in 2022 , but only one-third was processed through proper channels . Legal Framework for E-Waste Management Improper disposal of end-of-life EEE products has severe negative externalities, including risks to human health and environmental degradation. Effective management is essential to mitigate these harms. E-waste in India is regulated by the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2022, published by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC). These rules came into force on April 1, 2023. State Pollution Control Boards, responsible for inventorying, use inconsistent methods, causing discrepancies between Indian and international data. The Central Pollution Control Board has begun auditing recyclers, with over 50 firms checked in recent months. Companies are working to aggregate informal operations into formal \u201cmandi\u201d-style streams , recovering metals such as gold, copper, aluminium, and steel. Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Framework and Associated Concerns The government has introduced EPR rules requiring manufacturers to collect end-of-life appliances for recycling metals like copper, aluminium, nickel, cobalt, and lithium. This move is partly driven by geopolitical risks, such as China\u2019s export restrictions on rare earth elements. Dominance of Informal Sector A 2023 Indian Cellular and Electronics Association report flagged the dominance of the informal sector in India\u2019s recycling ecosystem. These operators focus on repairing and harvesting components, but remain outside formal frameworks, hindering the creation of a circular economy. Even within EPR, issues like \u201cpaper trading\u201d persist, with recyclers overstating volumes for financial incentives. Concerns on Traceability and Best Practices Experts stress that malpractices plague the sector, with many players lacking true metal extraction capacity . They highlighted the need for t hird-party audits, better environmental safeguards, and life-cycle visibility of products .

India Secures Second Deep-Sea Mineral Exploration Contract in Indian Ocean Sept. 30, 2025 Why in news? India has signed a new contract with the International Seabed Authority (ISA) granting exclusive rights to explore Polymetallic Sulphides (PMS) in the Carlsberg Ridge of the Indian Ocean. With this, India has become the first country in the world to hold two such ISA contracts , commanding the largest seabed area allocated internationally for PMS exploration. The National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR), Goa , will begin exploration in 2026 through geophysical and hydrographic surveys. India\u2019s application, submitted in 2024, was approved last week, allotting a 10,000 sq km area in the Carlsberg Ridge . This builds on its earlier 2016 contract for exploration in the Central and Southwest Indian Ridges, marking both a scientific breakthrough and a strategic advantage. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Polymetallic Sulphides and Their Importance for India India\u2019s Experience in PMS Exploration Significance of the Carlsberg Ridge How PMS Exploration Differs from Other Underwater Mineral Searches? How ISA Allocates Mineral Exploration Sites? India\u2019s Plans for Additional Mineral Exploration in the Indian Ocean Polymetallic Sulphides and Their Importance for India PMS are rich seabed deposits containing copper, zinc, lead, gold, silver , and trace amounts of rare and precious elements. Found near hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor, these deposits form when seawater seeps into cracks, interacts with magma beneath the Earth\u2019s crust, and resurfaces as mineral-rich hot water that solidifies on the seabed. For India, PMS exploration is vital as land-based reserves of such minerals are limited. Securing these resources is crucial for strategic industries, renewable energy systems, high-technology applications, and green technologies , thereby enhancing the country\u2019s resource security and self-reliance . India\u2019s Experience in PMS Exploration Since signing its first PMS exploration contract with the International Seabed Authority (ISA) in 2016, India\u2019s National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR) has carried out extensive surveys in the central and southwest Indian Ocean ridges, building significant expertise and infrastructure. The government\u2019s Deep Ocean Mission has strengthened these efforts by adding deep-sea vessels, advanced tools like Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) . The upcoming Matsya submersible under the Samudrayaan mission , which will further expand exploration capacity. NCPOR follows a three-phase plan : Reconnaissance surveys with ship-based tools to locate potential PMS sites. Near-seabed surveys using AUVs and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) to confirm deposits. Resource evaluation of identified PMS areas for assessing their economic potential. Significance of the Carlsberg Ridge The Carlsberg Ridge, part of the mid-ocean ridge system in the Indian Ocean, was formed by seafloor spreading between the Indian Plate and Somali Plate about 40 million years ago. With a slow spreading rate of 2.4\u20133.3 cm per year, it features rugged flanking topography and a median valley typical of slow-spreading ridges . The ridge hosts hydrothermal vent systems, making it a potential hotspot for Polymetallic Sulphide (PMS) deposits. India has been studying these systems for over three decades. Strategically, its proximity \u2014 located near 2\u00b0N latitude, much closer to India than the Central and Southwest Indian Ridges at 26\u00b0S \u2014 makes it highly significant for resource security and scientific exploration. How PMS Exploration Differs from Other Underwater Mineral Searches? PMS exploration is far more complex than other seabed mineral investigations. PMS deposits occur near hydrothermal vents along mid-ocean ridges, at depths of 2,000\u20135,000 metres , where the terrain is rocky, uneven, and remote. Survey operations require deep-sea vessels with dynamic positioning, precise navigation, and advanced communication systems. Unlike other explorations, PMS demands a multidisciplinary team of marine geologists, geophysicists, oceanographers, biologists, and deep-sea technologists. Exploration methods involve ship-mounted geophysical surveys for reconnaissance, and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) for detailed near-seabed mapping and sample collection. Advanced tools are essential to accurately analyse mineral composition , making PMS exploration one of the most technically demanding deep-sea missions. How ISA Allocates Mineral Exploration Sites? The International Seabed Authority (ISA) , established under the UNCLOS framework , manages mineral exploration in international waters. Countries, through their governments, public sector bodies, or sponsored entities, apply to the ISA for exploration rights.

China\u2019s WTO Concession and Implications for India Sept. 27, 2025 Context: China\u2019s announcement at the UN General Assembly that it will no longer seek Special and Differential Treatment (SDT) in future WTO negotiations marks a significant shift in global trade dynamics. This decision comes amid US tariff pressures and criticisms of SDT exploitation. The development has direct implications for India , which continues to rely heavily on SDT flexibilities to safeguard its agricultural and social welfare priorities. SDT and China\u2019s Tactical Retreat: What is SDT? SDT refers to provisions within World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreements that grant developing countries and Least-Developed Countries (LDCs) special rights and more favorable treatment. These include longer implementation periods, preferential access to markets , and support for capacity building to help them participate in global trade and economic development. The aim is to recognise the differing economic capacities between developed and developing nations and create a more equitable trading system. China\u2019s retreat: China\u2019s decision, while preserving its self-declared developing country status and all existing perks (such as lenient subsidy caps), is a tactical retreat amid long-standing US objections to the practice. While the WTO lauded it as a breakthrough for reform, sceptics see it as symbolic window-dressing , allowing China to deflect criticism without dismantling its agricultural and industrial advantages. Implications for India: Rising external pressure: President Donald Trump has announced a fresh salvo of 100% tariffs on branded and patented pharmaceutical products and also announced broader tariffs on furniture, kitchen cabinets, and trucks. Growing calls for India to shed its developing country status as its economy expands. India\u2019s dependence on SDT: SDT, which is rooted in the GATT legacy, offers flexibilities such as higher tariffs and longer compliance periods. These concessions are crucial for protecting vulnerable populations in a country where per capita income ranks 136th globally. Agriculture at the Core of the Debate: Agriculture employs around half of India\u2019s workforce and underpins the food security of 1.4 billion people . Under the WTO\u2019s Agreement on Agriculture (AoA), the trade-distorting Amber Box caps subsidies at 10% of production value for developing countries (versus 5% for developed ones). India leverages Article 6.2 exemptions for input subsidies to low-income farmers, channeling over $40 billion annually through mechanisms like Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for staples such as rice and wheat. These support the Public Distribution System (PDS) , distributing subsidised grains to 800 million beneficiaries. Hypocrisy of Developed Nations: The 1986-88 reference prices: Inflate India\u2019s reported Aggregate Measurement of Support (AMS), often exceeding the 10% threshold \u2014 drawing fire from the US and the Cairns Group for alleged market distortion. Double standards of developed nations: They provided $850 billion in global farm subsidies in 2023 (as per OECD estimates), protecting their own programmes through Green Box loopholes for research and environmental aid. Risks of Forced Graduation from SDT: Phased AMS reductions could slash subsidies by 20-30% over a decade , leading to a 10-15% drop in rural incomes and heightened food price volatility. Malnutrition , affecting 35% of children under five, might worsen, undermining the National Food Security Act. Recent WTO disputes, like the 2023 sugar subsidy panel, underscore these vulnerabilities. Strategic Options for India: Agriculture: India should strive to lead the G33 coalition to extend the 2013 Bali Ministerial\u2019s interim \u201cpeace clause\u201d on public stockholding beyond 2023, shielding MSP and PDS from WTO disputes until 2030. Transition input subsidies to Green Box measures (research, climate-resilient crops). It can also advocate for updating AoA reference prices to reflect current market realities. E-Commerce: India should join plurilateral e-commerce talks , offering commitments on consumer protection and cross-border data flows in exchange for tariff-free access to developed markets. Expand the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) to empower MSMEs in global e-commerce, and reduce reliance on SDT tariff protections. India should propose tiered data regulations in WTO talks , allowing developing nations longer transition periods to comply with global standards, preserving India\u2019s Personal Data Protection Act. Selective SDT phase-out: Reduce protections in non-core sectors for better market access. Retain exemptions for agriculture and vulnerable sectors. Use Green Box funds for cold storage and processing to boost exports.

Regulation of Social Media - Karnataka High Court on Sahyog Portal Sept. 26, 2025 Why in News? The Karnataka High Court rejected social media platform X\u2019s plea against the Central Government\u2019s Sahyog Portal - a digital mechanism to issue content takedown notices. The Court upheld the State\u2019s right to regulate social media , calling Sahyog an \u201c instrument of public good \u201d and a \u201c beacon of cooperation \u201d between citizens, state, and platforms. The Court stressed that social media platforms cannot operate in a state of \u201c anarchic freedom .\u201d What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Sahyog Portal - A Public Good X Corporation\u2019s Challenge Government\u2019s Defence High Court\u2019s Ruling Key Legal Issues Touched upon by the HC Implication of the HC Ruling Conclusion Sahyog Portal - A Public Good: Launched : October 2024 by the Union Home Ministry , and maintained by the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre ( I4C ). Purpose : A centralised channel (which connects central agencies, state police, and online intermediaries to combat cybercrime) for issuing takedown notices to intermediaries. Legal basis: Section 79(3)(b), IT Act, 2000 \u2013 intermediaries lose \u201csafe harbour protection\u201d if they fail to act upon government notices of unlawful content. Operational data: 65 intermediaries and nodal officers onboarded by April 2025. 130 takedown notices issued (Oct 2024 \u2013 Apr 2025) to platforms including Google, YouTube, Amazon, Microsoft. X Corporation\u2019s Challenge: Claim : Sahyog is a \u201c censorship portal \u201d creating a parallel, extra-legal content blocking regime. Arguments: Section 79(3)(b) notices bypass stricter procedural safeguards under Section 69A IT Act. Unlike Section 69A, notices under Section 79(3)(b) lack transparency, hearing, and written reasoning. Violates Shreya Singhal (2015) judgment, in which the apex court had specified that a takedown order under Section 79(3)(b) - Could only be issued pursuant to a court order or a government notification and Must relate to grounds similar to those in Section 69A. State governments and police issuing notices via Sahyog expands censorship Support : Supporting X\u2019s challenge, Digipub (collective of 92 digital publishers) argued that blocking orders through Sahyog threatens media freedom. Government\u2019s Defence: Necessity : Social media requires stricter regulation due to algorithmic amplification and rapid spread of harmful content. \u2018Safe harbour\u2019 is not absolute : It is a statutory privilege conditional upon due diligence. Separation of powers : Section 79(3)(b) and Section 69A operate independently. Section 79(3)(b): Failure to comply results in loss of safe harbour. Section 69A : Blocking power on grounds of sovereignty, security, public order. Efficiency : Sahyog is an efficient, transparent mechanism to expedite unlawful content removal. X Corp - a foreign entity : Hence, it cannot invoke Article 19 rights (available only to Indian citizens). High Court\u2019s Ruling: The judgment outlined three red lines for social media companies - Social media cannot remain unregulated. Companies must comply with the laws of the land. Past precedents like Shreya Singhal (2015) cannot be used to interpret new regulatory frameworks under IT Rules 2021. Key Legal Issues Touched upon by the HC: Need for regulation: The spread of information has always been regulated across civilizations . Social media as a \u201cmodern amphitheater of ideas\u201d cannot exist in anarchic freedom . Regulation is essential, especially for offences against women to safeguard the constitutional right to dignity. Regulation of social media is not unique to India , it is a global practice. Law of the Land - India is not a playground: Platforms cannot operate in India while ignoring its statutory framework. Liberty is tied to responsibility and accountability. X complies with the Take It Down Act in the US but refuses to follow similar takedown orders in India. American legal principles cannot be transplanted into the Indian constitutional framework. Shreya Singhal not applicable - New law, new interpretation: X argued that the 2015 Shreya Singhal judgment allowed censorship only via courts or under Section 69A, IT Act. Court held - Shreya Singhal judgment applied to the 2011 IT Rules (now obsolete). The 2021 IT Rules are distinct, requiring a new interpretative lens. Precedents cannot bind evolving regulatory regimes. Extent of Article 19 of the Indian Constitution : It applies only to Indian citizens; X, as a foreign corporation, cannot claim these protections. Implications of the HC Ruling: For intermediaries: Non-compliance with Sahyog notices may result in the loss of safe harbour protection - establishing legal liability . Digital governance : Shows India\u2019s move towards platform accountability. Cybersecurity : Strengthens mechanisms against cybercrime, misinformation, and online harms. Law and constitution: Reasserts sovereign right to regulate speech, balancing Article 19(1)(a) \u2013 freedom of ", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

Crime in India 2023 - NCRB Report Highlights Surge in Cybercrime in India Sept. 30, 2025 Why in News? The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) has released its Crime in India 2023 report (after a two-year gap), highlighting a significant increase in cybercrime cases. The data reflects growing vulnerabilities in India\u2019s digital ecosystem, with fraud, extortion, and sexual exploitation emerging as dominant motives behind such crimes. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Key Findings of the Report Cybercrime Trends State-Wise Data on Cribercrime Economic Offences (Broader Category) Analysis and Implications Conclusion Key Findings of the Report: Overall crime statistics: The data reflects a 7.2% overall increase in recorded crimes , reaching 6.24 million cases (crimes every five seconds on average in 2023). Traditional violent crimes such as murder (\u21932.8%) and rape (\u21935.9%) have declined . But cybercrime, economic offences, and miscellaneous crimes like obstruction on public way (Sec.283 IPC - \u219162%) and Motor Vehicle Act violations (\u2191103%) have surged . Offences against vulnerable sections: Crime against women : Marginal rise of 0.7% (448,211 cases). Crimes against SCs : \u21910.4% (57,789 cases). Crimes against children : \u21919.2%.

Analysis and Implications: Crime patterns shifting: From traditional violent crimes to economic and technology-driven crimes. Shift in crime categorisation and tracking : It is the last annual report under the IPC , as the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) came into force in July 2024. Digital fraud: It is the biggest challenge in India\u2019s cybercrime landscape . The concentration of cases in Karnataka, Telangana, and UP suggests urbanisation, IT penetration, and digital adoption are key drivers. Economic offences\u2019 steady rise: Highlights the need for robust financial cybersecurity mechanisms. Way Ahead: Strengthening cybersecurity infrastructure and digital literacy programs are crucial. Equipping law enforcement agencies: With advanced cyber forensic tools and training. Enhanced public-private collaboration : In monitoring, prevention, and quick response mechanisms.

Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE) - Norms to Revamp Vehicle Emissions Framework Sept. 29, 2025 Why in News? India has released draft Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE) 3 norms through the Bureau of Energy Efficiency ( BEE ). These norms aim to tighten fuel efficiency and emission standards while addressing industry demands for flexibility, especially for small cars and electric vehicles (EVs). What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Current CAFE Framework in India Key Features of Proposed CAFE 3 Norms Conclusion Current CAFE Framework in India: CAFE: Introduced in 2017 by BEE, Ministry of Power, to regulate fuel consumption and carbon emissions from passenger vehicles. These norms apply to vehicles running on petrol, diesel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), compressed natural gas (CNG), hybrids, and electric vehicles (EVs) weighing less than 3,500 kg . Designed to reduce oil dependency and curb air pollution , pushing automakers to lower carbon dioxide emissions while incentivising the production of EVs , hybrids, and CNG vehicles. CAFE 2: In 2022-23, the norms were tightened (fuel consumption capped at 4.78 litres/100 km, and CO\u2082 emissions capped at 113 g/km) with increased penalties for non-compliance. Need for CAFE 3: In the USA, EU, China, Japan, smaller lightweight cars receive relaxed CO\u2082 norms. However, India\u2019s current framework is inverted , giving SUVs more relaxed limits and burdening small cars. So, CAFE 3 seeks to align with global best practices. Key Features of Proposed CAFE 3 Norms: Applicability: Covers M1 category passenger vehicles with a seating capacity of 9 people (including the driver) and a maximum weight of 3,500 kilogram. Non-compliance will attract penalties under the Energy Conservation Act, 2001 . Efficiency targets: Under CAFE 3, the efficiency formula is: [0.002 x (W \u2013 1170) + c] . It is measured in petrol-equivalent litres per 100 kilometre. Here, W is the average fleet weight, 1,170kg is the fixed constant for weight, 0.002 is a fixed constant multiplier, and \u2018 c \u2019 is a constant that changes every year. Since \u2018c\u2019 continues to decrease from FY28 to FY32, the rules will become stricter over time . This constant starts at 3.7264 in FY28 , then subsequently drops to 3.0139 in FY32. Lighter vehicles have easier compliance compared to heavier SUVs or premium cars. Incentives for small cars: Additional relaxation of 3.0 g CO\u2082/km (capped at 9.0 g/km) for compact petrol cars (unladen mass up to 909 kg, engine capacity not exceeding 1200 cc and length not exceeding 4000 mm). This is designed to revive the small car segment , which saw a 71% sales decline in six years. Complementary policy: GST 2.0 reforms lowered GST on small cars from 28% to 18%. Boost for EVs and alternate fuels: Super credits multipliers: Companies could potentially obtain relaxation in their overall efficiency target as the norms propose to offer companies \u201c super credits \u201d based on the type of vehicle they sell. Each EV sold will be counted three times while calculating a company\u2019s average. Plug-in hybrids will be counted 2.5 times, and strong hybrids twice. Flex-fuel ethanol cars are given a smaller multiplier of 1.5. Carbon Neutrality Factor (CNF) introduced: CNF offers further relaxation on the targets based on the type of fuel used in a car. For example , for petrol vehicles (E20 to E30) 8% CNF on tailpipe CO2; for flex fuel ethanol vehicles and strong hybrid electric vehicles 22.3% CNF on tailpipe CO2; etc. Emissions pooling: Up to three carmakers can form a pool (to meet the targets jointly) and be treated as a single manufacturer. Pool manager legally responsible for compliance and penalties. Reduces compliance costs and encourages strategic alliances. Conclusion: The proposed CAFE 3 norms mark a critical shift in India\u2019s emission strategy \u2014reviving small cars, incentivising EVs, and tightening long-term efficiency goals. If implemented effectively, they could reduce India\u2019s oil import dependency, accelerate green mobility adoption , and align India\u2019s policies with global climate commitments under the Paris Agreement . However, challenges remain in industry adaptation , consumer acceptance, and infrastructure readiness for alternative fuel vehicles. newspaper.pdf ( Size: 684.9 KB ) Latest Article See All IndiGo Meltdown Dec. 5, 2025, 2:34 p.m. Economics India to Expand Its Busiest Rail Corridors: What\u2019s Planned Dec. 5, 2025, 2:08 p.m. Economics Census 2027 - Counting India, Renewing the Republic Dec. 5, 2025, 1:54 p.m. Editorial Analysis Health and National Security Cess on Demerit Goods Dec. 5, 2025, 1:48 p.m. Economics A Missing Link in India\u2019s Mineral Mission Dec. 5, 2025, 1:33 p.m. Editorial Analysis A Day to Pause and Come Down to Earth Dec. 5, 2025, 1:27 p.m. Editorial Analysis Rupee Breaches the 90-Mark Dec. 4, 2025, 1:36 p.m. Economics Putin\u2019s Visit: India\u2013Russia Ties and the Road Ahead Dec. 4, 2025, 1:24 p.m. International Relations Judiciary Flags Ma", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) - SC Clears JSW Steel\u2019s Acquisition of BPSL Sept. 28, 2025 Why in News? The Supreme Court of India has approved JSW Steel\u2019s $2.3 billion (\u20b919,350 crore) acquisition of Bhushan Power and Steel (BPSL), reversing its earlier decision of liquidation . This judgment strengthens the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016 , by prioritising revival of distressed firms over liquidation. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Understanding Insolvency and Bankruptcy and the IBC Process Followed under the IBC Supreme Court\u2019s Ruling Background Importance of BPSL to JSW Steel Liquidation Trends and Broader Implications of Judgment Conclusion Understanding Insolvency and Bankruptcy and the IBC: Insolvency vs Bankruptcy: While insolvency results from an inability to pay debts due to a lack of assets, bankruptcy occurs when an application is presented to an authority declaring insolvency and requesting to be declared bankrupt, which will last until discharge. About the IBC 2016: It is the bankruptcy law of India which seeks to consolidate the existing framework by creating a single law for insolvency and bankruptcy. It is a one stop solution for resolving insolvencies which previously was a long process that did not offer an economically viable arrangement. It aims to protect the interests of small investors and make the process of doing business less cumbersome. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI): It is the regulator for overseeing insolvency proceedings and entities like Insolvency Professional Agencies (IPA), Insolvency Professionals (IP) and Information Utilities (IU) in India. It was established on 1 October 2016 and given statutory powers through the IBC 2016. It functions under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and covers Individuals, Companies, Limited Liability Partnerships and Partnership firms. Process Followed under the IBC: Initiation of CIRP: Corporate Debtor (CD) : A company that has taken loans and defaults on repayment. Who can Apply: Either the creditor or the debtor can initiate proceedings. Relevant Section : Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process ( CIRP ) is governed by Section 6 of the IBC. Threshold for default: Earlier limit : \u20b91 lakh default. Revised limit : Raised to \u20b91 crore during the pandemic to reduce undue stress on companies. Adjudicating Authority (AA): Designated authority : National Company Law Tribunal ( NCLT ) benches across India. Role : Receives insolvency applications from creditors or debtors. Timeline : Must admit or reject application within 14 days, with reasons for delay if not disposed within this period. Commencement of CIRP: Trigger point : CIRP begins once NCLT admits the application. Resolution timeline : As per amendment, the process must be completed within 330 days (including litigation period). Outcome of CIRP: Resolution : Revival of the corporate debtor through restructuring or takeover by a Successful Resolution Applicant (SRA). Liquidation : If no resolution plan is approved within the stipulated period. Supreme Court\u2019s Ruling: Revival of BPSL : JSW Steel has invested in modernisation, safeguarded thousands of jobs, and ensured that the company will continue to operate. IBC objective fulfilled : The court emphasised that the essence of IBC is to convert loss-making firms into profitable entities. On claims : Creditors\u2019 demand for an additional \u20b96,100 crore was dismissed. The Court stated that once the Committee of Creditors (CoC) approves a plan, reopening claims undermines the law. CCDs as equity : Compulsorily Convertible Debentures (CCDs) issued by the Successful Resolution Applicant (SRA) must be treated as equity. Background: The SC had earlier ordered liquidation , citing JSW Steel\u2019s delay in implementing the plan and failure of CoC to exercise its commercial wisdom. The court criticised the Resolution Professional (RP) and CoC for failing to protect creditors\u2019 interests and supporting JSW despite violations. The (May 2024) order unsettled investors and cast doubts on the effectiveness of IBC reforms. Importance of BPSL to JSW Steel: BPSL contributes significantly to JSW\u2019s revenue and profitability. FY25 performance - Profit of \u20b9300 crore (Q1), loss of \u20b993 crore (Q2), profit of \u20b911 crore (Q3). BPSL increased capacity from 3.5 MTPA to 5 MTPA, operating advanced facilities across India. Analysts estimate an 8\u201310% revenue and EBITDA decline in FY26 if BPSL is liquidated. Liquidation Trends and Broader Implications of Judgment: Rising liquidations : FY24 witnessed 2,476 cases ending in liquidation with total claims of \u20b911 lakh crore. Recovery rate remained only 6.33% of admitted claims (\u20b969,634 crore). Example of Jet Airways : Earlier, Jet Airways faced liquidation due to a failed resolution plan (\u20b915,723 crore admitted claims). Liquidation of BPSL : This would have been the largest in corporate history. The judgment: This is expected to restore investor confidence in IBC a", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

The ECI\u2019s Ring Fence is the Constitution and the Law Aug. 27, 2025 Context Elections form the cornerstone of any democracy . Their credibility depends not only on the fairness of voting but also on the integrity of the electoral rolls that determine who has the right to vote. In recent weeks, two high-profile press conferences have brought India\u2019s electoral process under the scanner. Together, these events have triggered a national debate on whether India\u2019s democratic foundations are being eroded by systemic flaws in electoral management and by the Election Commission of India\u2019s (ECI) questionable responses. Opposition\u2019s Allegations: A Threat to Electoral Credibility On August 7, 2025, Rahul Gandhi\u2019s revelations concerning the Mahadevapura Assembly segment in Bangalore highlighted what appear to be blatant manipulations in voter registration. Instances of multiple voters listed under the same address, fictitious entries with placeholders such as \u201cxyz\u201d as a father\u2019s name , and even zero house numbers point to gross irregularities. Opposition claimed these findings were the result of six months of meticulous scrutiny of official ECI documents. If these charges are accurate , the implications are grave. The legitimacy of India\u2019s electoral process, and by extension its democratic system, is at stake. Free and fair elections are a constitutional guarantee , forming part of the \u201c basic structure \u201d of the Constitution. The ECI\u2019s Response: From Neutral Arbiter to Political Actor The second press conference, held on August 17, 2025, was expected to provide clarity and reassurance from the Election Commission. Instead, the CEC\u2019s ultimatum, demanding either a sworn affidavit from Gandhi or a public apology, deepened public unease. Rather than addressing the substance of the allegations, the ECI appeared to position itself as a political adversary. This is problematic for two reasons. First, the ECI is a high constitutional body whose independence and neutrality are essential to democracy. By entering into an adversarial posture with the opposition, it risks losing credibility as a fair umpire. Second, Article 324 of the Constitution vests the ECI with extensive powers to ensure the integrity of elections. But these powers must be exercised responsibly, not weaponized against political criticism. As the Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasised, Article 324 empowers but also obligates the Commission to safeguard democracy. Issuing ultimatums to political leaders is outside its constitutional remit. The Legal and Procedural Context The Representation of the People Act, 1950 , provides multiple safeguards for preparing and revising electoral rolls. These include annual revisions, public inspections, and mechanisms to address disputes. Yet, Gandhi\u2019s allegations reveal how these procedures may be circumvented or manipulated in practice. The challenge lies in reconciling two principles: one, the finality of elections, and the need to rectify systemic errors. While the law assumes that electoral rolls acquire finality before elections, large-scale irregularities cannot simply be brushed aside. A rigid reliance on technicalities such as demanding affidavits is counterproductive when the integrity of democracy itself is in question. The ECI\u2019s responsibility is not merely procedural compliance but substantive fairness. The Bihar \u2018Special Intensive Revision\u2019 Controversy The ongoing electoral revision exercise in Bihar further illustrates the fragility of the ECI\u2019s credibility. The Commission has undertaken what it calls a \u2018Special Intensive Revision\u2019 (SIR), despite the fact that neither the Act nor the Rules recognise such a category. By setting July 1 as the qualifying date, contrary to the statutory mandate of January 1, the ECI has acted beyond the law. Reports of chaotic enumeration, coupled with the deletion of 65 lakh voters, have sparked political turmoil in the State. Intensive revision, by definition, requires house-to-house verification, a task practically impossible to complete within a month. Unsurprisingly, the Supreme Court intervened, ordering publication of deleted names and reasons, a move widely welcomed as restoring transparency. The Broader Constitutional Concerns The controversy brings to mind Justice S. Murtaza Fazal Ali\u2019s prescient warning in A.C. Jose vs. Sivan Pillai (1984). He cautioned that unchecked powers in the hands of a politically compromised Election Commission could cause \u2018political havoc\u2019 and a constitutional crisis. The ECI, though constitutionally empowered, is not above the law and its mandate is to act as a neutral arbiter ensuring free and fair elections. Any deviation, whether through politicised responses to criticism, legal overreach, or procedural shortcuts, risks destabilizing India\u2019s democratic system.

From Japan, the Prime Minister will travel to China for the Heads of State Council meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in Tianjin. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? India\u2013Japan Ties: Old Partnership, Shared Vision Different Aspects of India\u2013Japan Cooperation Conclusion India\u2013Japan Ties: Old Partnership, Shared Vision India and Japan share one of India\u2019s oldest Annual Summit-level mechanisms , alongside Russia. Their ties were elevated progressively \u2014 Global Partnership (2000) , Strategic and Global Partnership (2006) , and Special Strategic and Global Partnership (2014) . Summits between former PM Shinzo Abe and PM Narendra Modi provided a strong strategic edge to the relationship. Alignment in the Indo-Pacific India\u2019s Act East Policy and Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI) align with Japan\u2019s Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) vision. Japan leads the connectivity pillar of IPOI and remains India\u2019s largest Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) donor. Multilateral Cooperation Beyond bilateral ties, both countries collaborate in Quad, International Solar Alliance (ISA), Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), and the Supply Chain Resilience Initiative (SCRI). Different Aspects of India\u2013Japan Cooperation As two leading Asian democracies and among the world\u2019s top five economies, their cooperation is underpinned by civilisational ties and converging global perspectives. Defence and Security India and Japan have strengthened defence ties through key agreements such as: the Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation (2008), MoU on Defence Cooperation and Exchanges (2014), Information Protection Agreement (2015), and the Reciprocal Provision of Supplies and Services Agreement (2020). They also co-developed the UNICORN naval mast (2024). Regular joint exercises include Malabar, Milan, JIMEX, Dharma Guardian, and Coast Guard cooperation , with 2024-25 witnessing the participation of service chiefs from both countries. Dialogue mechanisms such as Defence Ministers\u2019 meetings and Joint Service Staff Talks have consolidated trust. Both sides are considering an upgrade to the 2008 framework in light of the evolving security environment. Trade and Investment Bilateral trade reached $22.8 billion in 2023-24 and $21 billion in Apr\u2013Jan 2024-25. India mainly exports chemicals, vehicles, aluminium, seafood, while imports from Japan include machinery, steel, copper, and reactors. Japan is India\u2019s 5th-largest FDI source with cumulative investment of $43.2 billion up to Dec 2024. Around 1,400 Japanese companies with 5,000 establishments operate in India, while over 100 Indian firms are present in Japan. Emerging areas of focus include semiconductors, AI, clean energy, startups, and supply chain resilience. Leaders are expected to launch a new economic security initiative , revise the investment target from 5 trillion yen to 7\u201310 trillion yen, and expand digital and energy partnerships. Development and Infrastructure Cooperation Japan has been India\u2019s largest ODA donor since 1958 , disbursing JPY 580 billion ($4.5 billion) in 2023-24. The flagship Mumbai\u2013Ahmedabad High Speed Rail project exemplifies Japan\u2019s technology transfer and skill-building support. Both countries are considering a wider mobility partnership in railways, roads, and bridges. Multilateral and Regional Cooperation India and Japan coordinate closely through the Quad with the US and Australia to ensure a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific. They are also working on diversifying supply chains under the Supply Chain Resilience Initiative (SCRI) . Discussions will also cover the future of Quad in the context of US policy shifts under the Trump administration. People-to-People, Culture and Education The 2023-24 Year of Tourism Exchange, themed \u201c Connecting Himalayas with Mount Fuji\u201d , highlighted cultural bonds. Education ties are strong, with 665 academic partnerships and initiatives such as Edu-Connect, Universities Forum, and Skill Connect (2023) linking Indian talent with Japanese employers.

India\u2019s Aquanauts to Lead Deep-Sea Exploration under Samudrayaan Aug. 29, 2025 Why in news? Two Indian aquanauts, Cdr (Retd) Jatinder Pal Singh and R Ramesh, undertook training dives aboard the French vessel Nautile, reaching depths of 5,002 and 4,025 metres in the Atlantic Ocean earlier this month. These preparatory missions are crucial for India\u2019s ambitious Samudrayaan project , which aims to send three humans 6,000 metres deep into the ocean by 2027. The experience, much like how Axiom-4 supports Gaganyaan, will provide vital insights for advancing India\u2019s deep-sea exploration capabilities. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Samudrayaan Mission: India\u2019s Deep Ocean Exploration Plan Matsya-6000: India\u2019s Crewed Deep-Sea Submersible Challenges of India\u2019s Crewed Deep-Sea Mission under Samudrayaan India\u2019s Push for Deep Sea Exploration under the Blue Economy Vision Samudrayaan Mission: India\u2019s Deep Ocean Exploration Plan The Samudrayaan Mission , part of India\u2019s Deep Ocean Mission approved in 2021 with an outlay of \u20b94,077 crore over five years, aims to explore and sustainably utilise deep ocean resources. Its objectives include developing technologies for deep-sea mining, underwater vehicles, robotics, and a crewed submersible to carry three humans up to 6,000 metres below sea level. Other components involve creating: An ocean climate change advisory service, exploring and conserving deep-sea biodiversity, conducting surveys for mineral deposits, and innovating technologies for deriving energy and freshwater from the ocean. Additionally, the mission will establish an advanced marine station to boost research-to-industry applications in ocean biology and engineering, thereby supporting India\u2019s blue economy . The National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) is the coordinating agency leading the development of the human-carrying submersible. Matsya-6000: India\u2019s Crewed Deep-Sea Submersible Matsya-6000 is the specialised vehicle being developed under India\u2019s Samudrayaan Mission to carry three aquanauts to a depth of 6,000 metres in the ocean. Shaped like a large fish, it houses a 2.1-metre diameter personal sphere designed to safely accommodate the crew. The submersible will support human life for 12-hour missions , with backup systems ensuring survival for up to 96 hours in emergencies . For the initial human trials at 500 metres depth , a steel sphere will be used, though this material cannot withstand the extreme pressures at 6,000 metres (around 600 times atmospheric pressure at sea level ). For the full-scale mission planned for 2027 , the personal sphere will be constructed from a titanium alloy with 80 mm thickness , offering the required strength and durability for deep-sea exploration. Challenges of India\u2019s Crewed Deep-Sea Mission under Samudrayaan India\u2019s Samudrayaan Mission , which aims to send three aquanauts to a depth of 6,000 metres , faces multiple scientific, engineering, and human challenges. Developing a Pressure-Resistant Vessel The foremost challenge is building a submersible strong enough to withstand extreme ocean pressure \u2014 nearly 600 times atmospheric pressure at 6,000 metres. A titanium alloy personal sphere (2.1 m diameter, 80 mm thick) is being developed by ISRO. The challenge lies in sourcing titanium (a rare and strategically controlled material) and achieving precise electron beam welding, as even a 0.2 mm deviation in thickness could cause catastrophic collapse . Maintaining a Livable Environment Inside the confined personal sphere, aquanauts will require a controlled atmosphere with 20% oxygen levels and regulated carbon dioxide scrubbing. Emergency backup systems include packed re-breather oxygen units that recycle exhaled air, similar to diving systems. Ensuring Aquanaut Health and Safety Aquanauts must be in peak physical condition to endure long hours under extreme pressure and respond effectively to emergencies. With no access to washrooms, food and water intake is minimised before and during the mission. For instance, during a nine-hour test dive to 5,002 metres, Cdr (Retd) Jatinder Pal Singh consumed only a few dry fruits. Overcoming Communication Barriers Radio waves cannot penetrate deep waters , making conventional communication impossible. Instead, India has developed its own acoustic telephone, which transmits sound waves to receivers near the surface. Early harbour tests failed due to factors like temperature and salinity, but the system later worked successfully in open sea trials. India\u2019s Push for Deep Sea Exploration under the Blue Economy Vision India, with its 7,517 km-long coastline, is investing in deep-sea missions as part of its Blue Economy strategy to drive future growth and sustainable resource use.

US Tariffs on Indian Exports: Challenges and Opportunities for Diversification Aug. 28, 2025 Why in the News? The US has imposed steep 50% tariffs on Indian exports since August 27, hitting key sectors like textiles, gems, and jewellery, and prompting calls for trade diversification. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? US Tariffs on Indian Exports (Introduction, Impact, India\u2019s Dependence on the US Market, Policy Reforms & Diversification, Outcomes & Opportunities, etc.) Introduction India is facing a significant external trade challenge as the United States has imposed steep 50% tariffs on Indian goods exports . This development comes at a time when India\u2019s export sector has grown increasingly reliant on the American market, which has remained the country\u2019s largest trading partner for four consecutive years. The tariffs have not only raised questions about India\u2019s dependence on the US but have also triggered renewed debates on trade diversification, reforms, and the possibility of joining multilateral trade blocs. Impact of US Tariffs on Indian Exports The 50% tariff makes India\u2019s labour-intensive and low-margin exports , such as textiles, gems, jewellery, shrimps, furniture, and carpets, uncompetitive in the American market. Many small and medium exporters, particularly in hubs like Tirupur, Surat, and Noida , have already halted production due to falling demand and shrinking cost competitiveness. Although exports to the US account for less than 2% of India\u2019s GDP, the employment impact is disproportionately large, given that the affected sectors are among the most labour-intensive. Competitors such as Vietnam, Bangladesh, and Cambodia are poised to benefit from India\u2019s losses, as they currently face lower US tariffs. India\u2019s Overdependence on the US Market The latest tariff action has exposed the risks of India\u2019s growing reliance on a single export destination. As of 2024, the US accounted for 18% of India\u2019s exports , up from 11% in 2010. By contrast, China consciously reduced its dependence on the US by diversifying its export basket, with its share of exports to the US falling from 20% to 14% in the same period. This concentration has given the US significant leverage over India\u2019s trade policy. Until now, Indian exporters enjoyed relatively smooth access to the US market, with average tariffs of just 4% and minimal non-tariff barriers. That comfort discouraged India from aggressively pursuing alternative export destinations or multilateral trade agreements . Policy Space for Reform and Diversification The crisis has forced policymakers to reconsider three long-pending issues: Reducing dependence on the US market by aggressively pursuing trade with other regions, including Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia . Exploring multilateral trade deals , such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) , where key members like Japan, Australia, and ASEAN nations are supportive of India\u2019s entry. Reframing India-US trade negotiations by highlighting the broader economic relationship. While the US claims a goods trade deficit, it actually enjoys a $40 billion overall surplus with India when revenues from digital services, education, financial activities, royalties, and defence are considered. Domestic Measures to Cushion the Impact In the short term, exporters have demanded that the government facilitate domestic procurement by large buyers such as the Indian Railways and public sector undertakings. The Centre is also considering a relief package with cheaper credit , though the effectiveness of such measures remains uncertain without clarity on how long the tariffs will persist. Positive Outcomes and Opportunities Trade Reform Momentum : The tariffs could accelerate much-needed reforms in India\u2019s trade structure, such as lowering tariffs on intermediate goods to make domestic industries more competitive. Multilateral Leverage : India is better placed today to negotiate multilateral deals than during the RCEP talks, thanks to its greater willingness to adopt a \u201cstructured and balanced\u201d approach to market access. Diversification Push : With the US market becoming riskier, India is likely to expand its trade footprint in Europe, Africa, and Latin America , while also strengthening its presence in digital services and high-value manufacturing. newspaper.pdf ( Size: 780.3 KB ) Latest Article See All IndiGo Meltdown Dec. 5, 2025, 2:34 p.m. Economics India to Expand Its Busiest Rail Corridors: What\u2019s Planned Dec. 5, 2025, 2:08 p.m. Economics Census 2027 - Counting India, Renewing the Republic Dec. 5, 2025, 1:54 p.m. Editorial Analysis Health and National Security Cess on Demerit Goods Dec. 5, 2025, 1:48 p.m. Economics A Missing Link in India\u2019s Mineral Mission Dec. 5, 2025, 1:33 p.m. Editorial Analysis A Day to Pause and Come Down to Earth Dec. 5, 2025, 1:27 p.m. Editorial Analysis Rupee Breaches the 90-Mark Dec. 4, 2025, 1:36 p.m. Eco", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

Building Health for 1.4 billion Indians Aug. 29, 2025 Context India\u2019s health-care system faces a dual imperative: to expand access for millions of underserved citizens while ensuring affordability in the face of rising costs. Meeting this challenge demands not piecemeal solutions, but a systemic and interconnected approach, strengthening insurance, embedding prevention in primary care, leveraging digital tools, ensuring regulatory clarity, and attracting sustained investment. If executed with coherence, India has the opportunity to build a health-care model that is inclusive , financially viable, and globally aspirational. Insurance as the Foundation of Affordability Risk pooling through insurance is the most effective way to make costly medical care accessible. Even modest premiums can unlock significant financial protection, shielding households from catastrophic health shocks. Yet, insurance penetration in India remains limited , only 15\u201318% of Indians are covered, with a premium-to-GDP ratio of 3.7% compared to the global average of 7%. Despite this gap, the sector presents immense opportunity , with gross written premiums already reaching $15 billion in 2024 and projected to grow at over 20% annually until 2030. However, affordability cannot rest solely on insurance coverage. The true impact will emerge when payers, providers, and patients partner to expand coverage, integrate preventive care , and reposition insurance as a tool for everyday health security rather than merely a crisis response. Efficiency, Scale and The Role of Government Schemes Efficiency and Scale: India\u2019s Distinct Strength One of India\u2019s unique advantages lies in its capacity to deliver quality care at scale. Where medical imaging in Western countries may serve a handful of patients daily, Indian hospitals routinely maximise utilisation without diluting quality. This efficiency reflects decades of innovation in workflow design , doctor-patient ratios, and infrastructure management. The next frontier is extending this efficiency to underserved regions . Tier-2 and tier-3 cities, which remain at the margins of India\u2019s health-care system, represent the true test of inclusive growth. If India can replicate its urban efficiency in these geographies, it could close the access gap and set a global benchmark for how scale, innovation, and equity can converge. The Role of Government Schemes Schemes like Ayushman Bharat (PM-JAY) have already redefined access by covering nearly 500 million people with benefits of up to \u20b95 lakh per family for advanced care. The program has enabled millions of cashless treatments , with measurable outcomes such as a 90% increase in timely cancer treatments. Yet the success of such schemes hinges on greater participation by private hospitals , anchored in fair reimbursements and transparent processes. This would ensure both the financial viability of providers and genuine value for patients . The Way Forward Prevention as the Most Effective Cost-Saver Despite progress, studies reveal that even insured families often face catastrophic out-of-pocket expenses for chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension. The solution lies in two complementary strategies : redesigning insurance to include outpatient and diagnostic care, and launching a nationwide preventive health push. Prevention, however, requires public participation. Every rupee spent on healthier lifestyles saves multiples in future treatment costs. Schools, employers, communities, and citizens must collectively embrace a preventive mindset , controlling risks, raising awareness, and fostering long-term health security. Without this shift, India risks being overwhelmed by the growing burden of non-communicable diseases. Digital Transformation and Technological Innovation India was an early adopter of telemedicine and continues to advance digital health solutions . Artificial Intelligence tools that detect early signs of illness, triage diagnostic reports, and enable remote consultations are already in use. These innovations optimise medical resources and extend care to remote regions. Moreover, digital health is democratising access . A cardiologist in a metropolitan city can now guide treatment for a rural patient hundreds of kilometers away. Supported by the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission, universal health records and continuity of care are increasingly within reach. Regulation and Trust: The Missing Link Innovation alone is insufficient without trust. Rising health-care costs, such as insurers considering premium hikes due to pollution-driven illnesses, highlight the urgent need for regulatory safeguards. Robust oversight by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) is essential for fair pricing, transparent claims settlement, and grievance redressal. Without confidence in the system, households will remain reluctant to prioritise insurance.

The ASI is Facing a Credibility Crisis Aug. 28, 2025 Context Archaeology, as a scientific discipline, aims to reconstruct the past through material evidence and objective analysis. Yet in India, it has often become a contested field , where historical narratives are shaped as much by politics as by empirical findings. The recent controversy surrounding the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and the Keeladi excavations highlights not only the struggle between scientific inquiry and political agendas, but also the institutional limitations of the ASI in sustaining credibility and scholarly integrity. The Keeladi Excavations: A Challenge to Established Narratives The Objective of Keeladi Excavations The Keeladi excavations in Tamil Nadu, initiated in 2014, quickly emerged as one of the most significant archaeological projects in India. With over 7,500 artefacts unearthed in its early phases, the findings pointed to the existence of a literate, urban, and secular society in South India during the Early Historic Period. By potentially bridging the historical gap between the Iron Age (12th\u20136th century BCE) and the Early Historic period (6th\u20134th century BCE), Keeladi questioned the prevailing narrative of India\u2019s second urbanisation being centred solely around the Gangetic plains. The Politicisation of Keeladi The project\u2019s trajectory, however, was disrupted when its lead archaeologist, K . Amarnath Ramakrishna, was abruptly transferred in 2017. The ASI simultaneously dismissed the site\u2019s significance and halted further excavation, fuelling suspicion that institutional decisions were motivated by political sensitivities rather than scientific considerations. This intervention provoked both scholarly criticism and political confrontation between the Tamil Nadu and Union governments. Intervention of Madras High Court The Madras High Court eventually transferred the project to the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology , which expanded the scope of discovery by unearthing over 18,000 artefacts. The handling of Keeladi underscores a central issue : archaeology in India is not merely about uncovering the past, but about negotiating which versions of the past are permitted recognition. By downplaying Keeladi\u2019s implications for Dravidian antiquity, the ASI demonstrated how state institutions can constrain alternative historical narratives , even in the face of rigorous scientific evidence such as stratigraphic sequencing and Accelerator Mass Spectrometry dating. Challenges Faced by the ASI Methodological Inconsistency and Selective Rigor The Union government has argued that isolated findings cannot substantiate sweeping historical revisions without broader validation. While such caution ostensibly reflects methodological rigour, the ASI\u2019s track record reveals glaring inconsistency. At Adichanallur, one of the earliest archaeological sites in Tamil Nadu , the rediscovery of Iron Age artefacts in 2004 was met with prolonged neglect. Despite evidence suggesting a 3,000-year-old civilisation, the ASI delayed publication of results for over 15 years, requiring court intervention. Selective Caution This selective embrace of caution or speculation suggests that the ASI\u2019s commitment to rigour is often subordinate to ideological or political considerations. On one hand, findings that complicate dominant narratives (such as Keeladi\u2019s evidence of Dravidian urbanism) are dismissed as inconclusive; on the other hand, sites that reinforce mytho-historical or nationalist narratives are promoted with little hesitation. Such double standards weaken the ASI\u2019s credibility and reveal what scholars describe as methodological nationalism, an approach that privileges a singular, state-sanctioned vision of India\u2019s past. Institutional and Structural Weaknesses Scholars have long criticised the agency for arbitrary personnel decisions , reliance on outdated methods like the Wheeler system, and absence of comprehensive research frameworks. These factors contribute to the production of fragmented, poorly contextualised data , rather than coherent historical interpretations. Equally troubling is the ASI\u2019s insularity. Unlike global counterparts such as the Deutsches Arch\u00e4ologisches Institut in Germany or the Institut National de Recherches Arch\u00e9ologiques Pr\u00e9ventives in France , the ASI rarely publishes findings in peer-reviewed academic journals. Instead, it circulates knowledge internally through monographs and bulletins , limiting scholarly scrutiny and international engagement. This lack of transparency fuels suspicion, stifles debate, and prevents Indian archaeology from contributing fully to global scholarship. The Way Forward: Toward Reform and Renewal To restore its credibility, the ASI must undergo comprehensive reform. First, structural changes are needed to reduce bureaucratic interference and ensure financial and intellectual autonomy.

India\u2019s School Enrolment Declines Amid Falling Birth Rates & Demographic Shifts Aug. 29, 2025 Why in the News? India\u2019s school enrolment fell by 25 lakh in 2024-25, with UDISE+ data linking the decline to falling birth rates and rising preference for private schools. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? School Enrolment (Introduction, Trends, Causes Behind Decline, Positive Indicators & Decline, Long Term Implications, etc.) Introduction India\u2019s school enrolment figures have witnessed a concerning decline for the third consecutive year. According to the latest Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) data released by the Ministry of Education, total enrolment of students aged 3 to 11 dropped by nearly 25 lakh in 2024-25 compared to the previous year . Overall, total enrolment across Classes 1-12 fell by 11 lakh students, marking the lowest level since 2018-19. While falling birth rates are a primary reason, migration patterns, demographic transitions, and the expansion of private schools are shaping India\u2019s changing education landscape. Trends in School Enrolment The UDISE+ 2023-24 report recorded 12.09 crore students in foundational and preparatory stages. This number declined to 11.84 crore in 2024-25, registering a dip of 24.93 lakh students. Similarly, total enrolment across schools (Classes 1-12) dropped from 24.80 crore in 2023-24 to 24.69 crore in 2024-25. This continuing decline marks a structural shift in India\u2019s school-age population. While government schools have seen steady reductions in enrolment, private schools have registered growth. Government school enrolment declined from 13.62 crore in 2022-23 to 12.16 crore in 2024-25, while private schools saw a rise from 8.42 crore to 9.59 crore over the same period. This reflects parents\u2019 increasing preference for private institutions despite higher costs. Causes Behind the Decline Falling Birth Rates A major driver of this enrolment dip is India\u2019s declining fertility rate. The National Family Health Survey 2021 reported India\u2019s Total Fertility Rate (TFR) at 1.91, below the replacement level of 2.1. Except for states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Meghalaya, most have fertility rates below replacement levels. With fewer children being born, the natural pipeline of primary school-age students has shrunk. Data Accuracy and Methodology Changes The enrolment decline since 2022-23 also coincides with a new methodology adopted by UDISE+, which now records individual student data rather than aggregated school-level numbers. This change weeded out duplicate entries, contributing to a more accurate, though lower, enrolment figure. Migration and Private Sector Expansion Migration to urban centres and the increasing prevalence of standalone private pre-primary institutions have influenced enrolment statistics. Many children are now being enrolled in private nurseries and preschools outside the government data system, further explaining the decline in official numbers. Positive Indicators Amid Decline Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER): GER at the middle school level improved from 89.5% in 2023-24 to 90.3% in 2024-25, and at the secondary level from 66.5% to 68.5%. This suggests that a higher proportion of eligible children are staying within the school system. Reduced Dropout Rates: Dropout rates have consistently fallen. In preparatory stages, dropouts reduced from 3.7% in 2023-24 to 2.3% in 2024-25. Similarly, in secondary schools, dropout rates dropped from 10.9% to 8.2%. Improved Gender Balance: While enrolment among boys slightly decreased, enrolment among girls remained stable and even saw marginal improvement. Teacher-Student Ratios: Teacher availability has improved significantly. At the foundational level, the teacher-student ratio improved from 1:15 in 2014-15 to 1:10 in 2024-25, indicating better learning conditions. Long-Term Implications The consistent decline in enrolment reflects broader demographic transitions in India. As the country edges towards an ageing society, education policies will need to adapt to shrinking cohorts of young learners. This could allow for more investment per student, higher-quality learning environments, and a focus on improving learning outcomes rather than expanding enrolment. At the same time, the rising preference for private schools underscores the need for policy reforms in government schooling. Strengthening infrastructure, ensuring accountability, and raising teaching standards will be crucial to retaining enrolment in public schools. Additionally, once Census 2026 data becomes available, the true extent of demographic changes and their implications for India\u2019s education system will be clearer. newspaper.pdf ( Size: 552.6 KB ) Latest Article See All IndiGo Meltdown Dec. 5, 2025, 2:34 p.m. Economics India to Expand Its Busiest Rail Corridors: What\u2019s Planned Dec. 5, 2025, 2:08 p.m. Economics Census 2027 - Counting India, Renewing the Republic Dec. 5, 2025, 1:5", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

Chief Economic Advisor V. Anantha Nageswaran said that Indian households\u2019 disposable income will be significantly higher this year compared to last year. This increase is mainly driven by easing inflation and the tax cuts already announced, along with potential further reductions expected soon. The rise in disposable income is seen as a positive factor for household spending and economic growth. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Understanding Disposable Income Higher Disposable Income in 2025 Urban vs Rural Demand Trends Countering US Tariffs Understanding Disposable Income Disposable income is the money that households have left after paying taxes. It is the net income available for spending and saving. In simple words, it\u2019s the money in one\u2019s hand after the payment of one\u2019s taxes. People can use it for daily expenses like food, rent, healthcare, education, or save and invest it for the future. Formula: Disposable Income = Total Income \u2013 Taxes Role of Inflation in Disposable Income Even if disposable income (after-tax income) remains the same in numbers, high inflation reduces its real value . E.g., If disposable income is \u20b950,000, and inflation rises, the same \u20b950,000 buys fewer goods and services. High Inflation \u2192 Lower real disposable income \u2192 People cut down on non-essential spending, which slows down demand and growth. Also, when inflation is high, households may struggle to save because a larger share of disposable income goes toward basic expenses (food, fuel, rent). This reduces long-term investments and weakens financial security. Importance of Higher Disposable Income Boosts Consumption : When people have more money left after taxes and inflation, they can spend more on goods and services, which drives economic growth. Improves Standard of Living : Higher disposable income allows households to afford better food, healthcare, education, and housing, improving overall quality of life. Supports Savings & Investments : Families with more money left after expenses can save and invest, which builds financial security and contributes to capital formation. Encourages Business Growth: Increased consumer spending raises demand, helping businesses grow, expand production, and create more jobs. Enhances Economic Resilience: Higher disposable income cushions families against inflation or economic shocks, reducing poverty and vulnerability. Economic Growth: Higher disposable income boosts consumer spending on goods and services, which drives demand, stimulates economic activity, and creates more jobs\u2014making it a key driver of growth. Higher Disposable Income in 2025 Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) V. Anantha Nageswaran announced that Indian households\u2019 disposable income will be significantly higher this year compared to 2024. This improvement is attributed to lower inflation , the direct tax cuts announced in the 2025 Union Budget , and the expected GST rate rationalisation . These measures are expected to boost household spending and support economic growth. India\u2019s GDP growth for April\u2013June 2025 reached 7.8%, the highest in five quarters, surpassing expectations. Urban vs Rural Demand Trends Despite concerns raised in the RBI\u2019s August MPC meeting about weak urban demand , CEA argued that urban consumption was underestimated due to reliance on traditional surveys. He cited UPI merchant payment data , which showed strong growth in digital transactions across categories . Rural demand has remained resilient, supported by a good monsoon, while urban consumption displayed mixed trends\u2014robust in services like hospitality and trade but muted in housing and consumer durable loans. Countering US Tariffs From August 27, 2025 , tariffs on Indian goods entering the US market doubled to 50% (25% duty + 25% penalty linked to India\u2019s Russian oil imports). This raises risks for labour-intensive export sectors such as textiles, potentially impacting jobs, wages, and consumption, and dampening private investment. Economists caution of a possible negative domino effect on growth. Government\u2019s Policy Response The government is pursuing a two-pronged strategy : Boosting domestic consumption through income tax cuts (\u20b91 lakh crore revenue loss estimated) and GST rationalisation to lower inflation.

Supreme Court\u2019s Social Media Regulation Order: Free Speech and Accountability Aug. 31, 2025 Why in the News? The Supreme Court has directed the Centre to frame guidelines for regulating social media, stressing that free speech cannot be misused for commercial gain at the cost of public dignity. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Court\u2019s Order (Introduction, Court\u2019s Directives, Constitutional Framework, Debate on Free Speech, Broader Implications, etc.) Introduction Recently, the Supreme Court of India directed the Union government to draft comprehensive guidelines for regulating social media content. The order comes amid growing concerns over the misuse of free speech by influencers and digital creators for commercial gain, often at the cost of public sentiment and individual dignity. The directive marks a significant step in balancing constitutional freedoms with accountability in the digital age. The Supreme Court\u2019s Directive A two-judge bench stressed that while free speech is a constitutional right under Article 19(1)(a) , it cannot be used purely for commercial purposes in a manner that offends vulnerable groups. The case originated from a petition filed by a non-profit supporting individuals with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), who alleged derogatory remarks made by comedians had violated their dignity. The court ordered the Centre to frame regulations in consultation with the National Broadcasters and Digital Association (NBDA) and also directed the comedians involved to issue public apologies on their social media platforms. Constitutional Framework on Free Speech The Constitution permits restrictions on free speech under Article 19(2) on limited grounds, including: Sovereignty and integrity of India Security of the State Friendly relations with foreign states Public order Decency and morality Contempt of court Defamation Incitement to offences The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that restrictions cannot extend beyond these grounds. In Shreya Singhal v. Union of India (2015), the Court struck down Section 66A of the IT Act for criminalising vague expressions like \u201cannoyance\u201d or \u201chatred,\u201d affirming that even speech that \u201coffends, shocks, or disturbs\u201d remains constitutionally protected. The Debate on Commercial Speech The regulation of commercial speech has had an evolving jurisprudence in India: In Hamdard Dawakhana v. Union of India (1959), the Court held that advertisements tied to trade and commerce do not qualify as free speech. However, in Tata Press v. MTNL (1995), the Court recognised commercial speech as constitutionally protected, since advertisements serve public interest by disseminating information. Later judgments, such as A. Suresh v. State of Tamil Nadu (1997), reiterated the need to balance commercial expression with societal interests. This evolution demonstrates the Court\u2019s nuanced approach to distinguishing between public-interest commercial expression and purely profit-driven content. Existing Legal Framework for Digital Media Social media companies in India are already governed by the IT (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 under the IT Act, 2000. These rules require platforms to restrict obscene, pornographic, or harmful content. Influencers and online creators are also subject to criminal law if their speech amounts to defamation, incitement, or other recognised offences. Experts caution that any additional guidelines must be carefully drafted to avoid infringing upon free speech, given the Supreme Court\u2019s strong history of protecting this right. Broader Implications The Court\u2019s intervention raises critical questions about the future of free speech in the digital age. With nearly 491 million Indians active on social media , the regulation of online platforms is no longer just a legal issue but also a societal necessity. While the move is aimed at curbing abusive or derogatory content disguised as entertainment or marketing, it also places the responsibility on the government to ensure that regulation does not become a tool of censorship. Legal scholars argue that the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cpolyvocality\u201d in free speech jurisprudence, arising from differing judicial interpretations, has resulted in inconsistencies. This ruling, therefore, may provide an opportunity to consolidate principles of accountability without diluting constitutional protections.

Cotton, the key raw material for India\u2019s textile industry and grown by nearly six million farmers , has seen a decline in domestic production. To address this, the Centre has withdrawn the 11% import duty \u2014first imposed in February 2021\u2014until September 30 , when the current cotton season ends. The move follows a steep rise in cotton imports last year, despite the duty being in place. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Introduction and Withdrawal of Cotton Import Duty Implications of Cotton Import Duty Withdrawal Current Status of Cotton Production and Imports in India Long-Term Solutions for Cotton Sector Introduction and Withdrawal of Cotton Import Duty The import duty was announced in the 2021 Budget, when the country was producing 350 lakh bales of cotton annually against the requirement of 335 lakh bales. While the country was exporting cotton, there were imports too and the duty was aimed at protecting the interest of cotton growers. However, as the textile industry later faced a raw material shortage, the government exempted all varieties of cotton from the duty between April\u2013September 2022, later extending it to October 2022. According to the Global Trade Research Initiative, cotton imports surged 107.4%, rising from $579.2 million in FY2023-2024 to $1.20 billion in FY2024-2025. Implications of Cotton Import Duty Withdrawal With this, the government has scrapped both the 5% basic customs duty and the 5% agriculture cess on cotton, enabling mills to source raw material at lower costs . This move is expected to cool domestic cotton prices , benefitting everything from T-shirts to handloom sarees , and provide relief to SMEs in the textile sector . The decision comes as Indian apparel exporters face steep global competition , burdened by nearly 60% tariffs in the US (compared to Bangladesh and Vietnam at 20%). Rising cotton prices at home had further strained the industry, making the exemption a step taken in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d . Implications The withdrawal of cotton import duty will mainly benefit garment exporters, as around two lakh bales in transit will now enter duty-free. This will give them a level-playing field internationally where high raw material costs earlier hampered competitiveness. Several global brands also expect Indian suppliers to use this imported cotton. However, farmers have voiced concerns, arguing that the move discourages cotton cultivation. Without adequate government support, they feel the decision undermines their interests, even as exporters and manufacturers stand to gain. Current Status of Cotton Production and Imports in India India\u2019s domestic cotton production has fallen to 294 lakh bales in 2024-25, the lowest in 15 years, against a requirement of 318 lakh bales (including non-mill use). Output this season is projected to be 20 lakh bales lower than last year. To bridge the gap, imports may touch 40 lakh bales, mainly from Australia ($258.2 million), the U.S. ($234.1 million), Brazil ($180.8 million), and Egypt ($116.3 million). Meanwhile, the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) procured around 100 lakh bales at MSP, spending \u20b937,500 crore, and has already sold 73 lakh bales in the market. For the 2025-26 season starting October 1, the government has announced an 8% hike in MSP, with fresh supplies expected from northern States in October and central and western States after Deepavali. Long-Term Solutions for Cotton Sector The textile industry seeks policy stability in cotton procurement. It suggests the government suspend import duty during the non-peak season (April\u2013September) , after farmers sell most of their produce, ensuring mills access affordable raw material without affecting growers. Additionally, the industry has asked for a 5% interest subvention on working capital to help mills, especially MSMEs , purchase cotton during the peak season. With sufficient funds, mills could cover their cotton needs, reducing dependence on costly MSP operations by the government.

Trump\u2019s 50% Tariffs on Indian Exports: Impact on the Economy Aug. 27, 2025 Why in the News? The US has imposed 50% tariffs on Indian exports effective August 27, 2025 , hitting key sectors like textiles, gems, jewellery, and shrimps, raising concerns over a trade and investment slowdown. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? US Tariffs (Introduction, Details, Impact, Implications, Geopolitical Dimensions, Way Forward, etc.) Introduction On August 27, 2025 , the United States, under President Donald Trump, implemented steep 50% tariffs on Indian merchandise exports , significantly escalating trade tensions. These tariffs, applied across a wide range of labour-intensive and low-margin products, mark one of the sharpest trade restrictions India has faced in recent years. The move is expected to severely disrupt India\u2019s export performance, particularly in sectors like textiles, gems and jewellery, shrimp, carpets, and furniture. The rationale behind the additional tariffs lies in the US\u2019s objections to India\u2019s purchases of Russian oil and defence equipment , which the Trump administration cited as the basis for penalising India. However, the implications of this decision stretch far beyond geopolitical concerns, threatening millions of jobs, export revenues, and investment momentum under India\u2019s ambitious Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes . Details of the US Tariffs The new tariff regime effectively doubles existing duties, taking tariffs to over 60% in some categories . Nearly 66% of Indian exports to the US , valued at around $59 billion in FY25, are now subject to the 50% tariff. According to the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) , exports could plummet by as much as 40-45% in FY26 , reducing shipments to the US from $87 billion in FY25 to $49.6 billion. Duty-free Exports (30%) : Pharmaceuticals ($12.7 billion), electronics ($10.6 billion), and petroleum products remain exempt. Moderate Tariffs (4%) : Auto parts will face 25% tariffs. Heavy Tariffs (66%) : Apparel, textiles, gems and jewellery, shrimps, handicrafts, carpets, and furniture will face the brunt. Sectoral Impact on India The US is India\u2019s largest export market , accounting for nearly 20% of total merchandise exports and about 2% of GDP . Labour-intensive sectors with high US dependence are at maximum risk: Textiles & Apparel : Units in Tirupur, Noida, and Surat have already reported halts in production. With the US accounting for nearly 60% of home textiles exports and 50% of carpet exports , the fallout could be devastating. Gems & Jewellery : Exports worth over $10 billion to the US (30% of the industry\u2019s total) face erosion, raising fears of widespread job losses. Shrimps : The US contributes nearly 48% of revenue for Indian shrimp exporters, making the marine sector highly vulnerable. Handicrafts & Furniture : Both industries, dependent on American demand, risk sharp revenue contractions. According to industry estimates, export volumes from these affected sectors could plunge by up to 70% , leading to widespread unemployment, particularly for low-skilled workers. Implications for India\u2019s PLI Push and Capex Momentum The timing of the US tariffs is particularly sensitive, as India is banking on the PLI scheme to boost manufacturing and exports in high-value sectors. However, the tariffs could derail capital-intensive industries by deepening the private capex slowdown: Weak PLI Uptake in Key Sectors : Applications for advanced chemistry cells, solar PV modules, and drones have lagged due to high investment needs. Investor Caution : Tariff-related uncertainty has made firms wary of long-term commitments in export-dependent sectors. Crisil Analysis : Nearly 50% of planned industrial capex is exposed to global trade risks, including US tariffs and EU climate policies. While lower capex-intensive sectors like food processing and pharmaceuticals under PLI have seen strong uptake, sectors like electronics, solar, and batteries face setbacks that could delay India\u2019s manufacturing growth trajectory. Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Dimensions The US tariffs could cut India\u2019s GDP growth down from 6.5% to 5.6% , according to trade experts. With competitors like Vietnam , Bangladesh , and Cambodia benefiting from lower tariffs, India risks losing its competitive edge in critical export markets. Geopolitically, the tariffs underline the fragile nature of India-US trade ties , where strategic convergence on security is increasingly clashing with protectionist economics. Moreover, with Trump threatening 200% tariffs on pharmaceuticals unless companies localise production in the US, further disruptions cannot be ruled out. Way Forward Despite the grim outlook, India retains some advantages: Domestic Economy : With exports forming only 20% of GDP , India is less vulnerable compared to Vietnam (90%). Diversification Opportunities : Strengthening trade with the EU, ASEAN, Africa, and the Middle East can partiall", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

India\u2019s Demographic Dividend as a Time Bomb Aug. 29, 2025 Context Rabindranath Tagore once wrote, \u201c Don\u2019t limit a child to your own learning, for she was born in another time.\u201d These words, spoken over a century ago, hold striking relevance for India today. At a time when technology is transforming the very fabric of work and society, the nation\u2019s education system remains tethered to outdated structures. The consequence is a growing misalignment between what young Indians are taught and what the future economy demands. The Future of Work, the Education Lag and The Demographic Dividend Paradox The Future of Work, the Education Lag The world of work is being reshaped by emerging technologies , with Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the forefront. Research suggests that nearly 70% of jobs worldwide will be impacted by AI , with up to a third of tasks in many occupations automated entirely. While this disruption is displacing traditional roles , it is also creating new opportunities in AI development, data analysis, cybersecurity, and other knowledge-intensive sectors. Yet, India\u2019s curriculum cycles remain locked in three-year updates that barely scratch the surface of this transformation. Students continue to be prepared for roles that are either disappearing or radically evolving. The Demographic Dividend Paradox With over 800 million people under the age of 35, India possesses the largest youth population in the world. In theory, this is a powerful growth engine; in practice, it has become a double-edged sword. Despite producing millions of graduates each year, employability remains alarmingly low. Nearly half of engineering graduates struggle to secure jobs , underscoring the widening chasm between degrees and real-world skills. The numbers are stark: according to higher education leaders, 61% of curricula are not aligned with industry needs. The Graduate Skills Index 2025 reveals that only 43% of Indian graduates are considered job-ready. This paradox, of abundant graduates but scarce employable talent , threatens to turn the demographic dividend into a demographic time bomb. The Crisis Begins in High School A 2022 survey found that 93% of students between grades 8 and 12 were aware of only seven career options, mostly traditional professions such as doctor, engineer, or lawyer. In reality, today\u2019s economy offers over 20,000 possible career paths . Shockingly, just 7% of students reported receiving any formal career guidance. This lack of awareness funnels students into degrees misaligned with both their aptitudes and market demands . The India Skills Report 2024 found that more than 65% of high school graduates pursue degrees incompatible with their interests or abilities. By the time they graduate, they are neither equipped with job-ready skills nor prepared for the careers of tomorrow. Policy Attempts and Their Shortcomings Recognising the crisis, the Indian government has launched numerous initiatives, from the Skill India Mission to Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana and SANKALP . Yet, despite heavy funding, most of these programs have fallen short of their ambitious targets . Fragmentation and lack of coordination among initiatives have diluted their impact. What India urgently requires is not more acronyms, but a cohesive, unified national strategy that aligns education with industry needs. Collaboration between government, educational institutions, and the private sector will be key to building a robust skill-development ecosystem. The Decisive Decade India\u2019s aspirations to be a global digital powerhouse hinge on its ability to equip youth with future-ready skills. The next decade will be decisive. Failure to act risks creating a generation of literate yet unemployable citizens , a crisis that could destabilize the nation\u2019s social fabric. Historical precedents, such as the youth-led unrest during the Mandal Commission protests , remind us that disillusioned youth movements can spiral into volatility. Yet, this is not an inevitable trajectory. The AI revolution, though disruptive, presents immense opportunities. The World Economic Forum estimates that while automation may displace 92 million jobs in India by 2030 , it will also create 170 million new ones. The challenge, therefore, is not one of scarcity but of transition: preparing youth to seize emerging roles while cushioning the losses from automation. Conclusion India\u2019s education crisis is not merely an academic or employment issue; it is a national imperative that touches upon economic growth, social stability, and the future of democracy itself. To heed Tagore\u2019s wisdom, India must stop limiting children to outdated learning. Instead, it must prepare them for the realities of their own time, a time defined by AI, global competition, and rapidly evolving career landscapes. The choice is stark: convert the demographic dividend into a transformative asset, or allow it to decay into a liability.

With the end of the Modi-Trump camaraderie and the US imposing steep tariffs on Indian goods, New Delhi is redirecting diplomatic focus. Prime Minister Modi will visit Tianjin for the 2025 SCO Summit and meet Chinese President Xi Jinping to strengthen bilateral ties. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? India-China Relations: From Conflict to Cautious Recalibration Trump\u2019s Tariffs Push India and China Closer Challenges of Deepening India-China Trade Ties India\u2019s Trade Dilemma Between the US and China India-China Relations: From Conflict to Cautious Recalibration India\u2013China relations deteriorated sharply after the June 2020 Galwan Valley clashes , which fueled strong public sentiment in India to cut trade ties with China. In response, the Indian government banned several Chinese apps and imposed restrictions on Chinese FDI. Trade and Economic Concerns India has resisted deeper economic integration with China, most notably by pulling out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in late 2019. Policymakers feared Chinese imports would flood Indian markets, undermining domestic industries. India as a \u201cChina +1\u201d Alternative Post-Covid, India has sought to position itself as a viable \u201cChina +1\u201d investment destination for Western businesses. However, competition from countries like Vietnam, Mexico, and Poland has limited India\u2019s success. Security and Strategic Tensions Beyond trade, Indians increasingly view China as their primary strategic adversary. Even during conflicts with Pakistan, such as after the April 2025 Pahalgam terror attack, India perceived Chinese weaponry in Pakistani hands, deepening security concerns. Trump\u2019s Tariffs Push India and China Closer The sharp rise in US tariffs has forced both India and China to explore closer cooperation. India now faces 50% tariffs \u2014 the second-highest after Brazil \u2014 while China, which earlier endured 145% tariffs before seeing them reduced to 30%, has already begun outreach to multiple nations. The US\u2019s \u201creciprocal tariff\u201d approach, aimed at balancing trade deficits, made such measures predictable. Reports reveal that China approached India in March 2025, but New Delhi responded only in June. Recently, China criticised US tariff hikes on India, echoing PM Modi\u2019s own past remarks by calling India and China \u201cdouble engines\u201d of Asia\u2019s economic growth. Challenges of Deepening India-China Trade Ties Amid rising US tariffs on Indian goods, China\u2019s offers of closer trade ties may appear attractive. However, experts warn that relying more on China could pose long-term risks for India. Trade Deficit Concerns - India enjoys a $40+ billion trade surplus with the US , but faces a $100 billion trade deficit with China , highlighting structural imbalances in bilateral trade. China\u2019s Manufacturing Dominance - China has emerged as the world\u2019s sole manufacturing superpower , capturing a massive share of global exports, making it difficult for India to compete directly. India\u2019s Manufacturing Weakness - Since 2019-20, manufacturing GVA has grown only 4% CAGR , slower than agriculture (4.7%), underscoring India\u2019s struggle to build competitive manufacturing strength. Impact on India\u2019s \u201cChina +1\u201d Position - If India aligns too closely with China, it may lose credibility as a viable alternative to China for Western businesses seeking to diversify supply chains. China\u2019s Overcapacity Challenge - China\u2019s deflation and industrial overcapacity may push it to dump cheap goods in other markets, including India, intensifying pressure on Indian producers. Geopolitical Mismatch - While both nations are economic powerhouses, India\u2019s democratic, transparent, private sector-led model contrasts with China\u2019s state-driven system . Moreover, China\u2019s support for Pakistan complicates trust-building. India\u2019s Trade Dilemma Between the US and China India\u2019s reluctance to embrace free global trade stems from its deep-rooted structural weaknesses . For years, coalition politics was seen as a hurdle to reforms, but even a decade of single-party majority governments since 2014 has not delivered significant structural reforms. Instead, India has drifted towards greater protectionism , while its growth momentum has slowed. China\u2019s Rise and Risks During this time, China has expanded its manufacturing dominance, becoming so large that it poses a challenge to the United States. However, China now faces industrial overcapacity and deflation , pushing it to dump cheap goods in foreign markets \u2014 a risk that could further hurt Indian industries if India opens up excessively to Chinese imports. US Challenges Meanwhile, the United States appears as a superpower seeking to reassert its global dominance, using tariffs and \u201creciprocal\u201d trade measures under President Trump.

In An Unstable World, Energy Sovereignty is the New Oil Aug. 30, 2025 Context India\u2019s dependence on imported hydrocarbons represents not merely an economic challenge but a national security vulnerability. With over 85% of crude oil and more than 50% of natural gas imported, the country\u2019s energy lifelines are at the mercy of geopolitical volatility, fragile supply chains , and sudden market shocks. The reliance on discounted Russian barrels since 2022 has provided temporary fiscal relief , yet it underscores the perils of overdependence on a single source. The pursuit of energy sovereignty, therefore, is not a policy preference but a survival strategy for India in a turbulent global order. Lessons from Global Energy Flashpoints The fragility of global energy security is not hypothetical; it is a historical fact. Five pivotal events highlight how crises have repeatedly forced nations to rethink energy strategy: The 1973 Oil Embargo exposed Western vulnerability to OPEC\u2019s leverage but also triggered innovations in strategic reserves and diversification. The Fukushima Disaster (2011) undermined nuclear confidence, forcing Japan and others toward coal and gas, only to rediscover the necessity of zero-carbon baseloads. The Texas Freeze (2021) demonstrated the inadequacy of infrastructure built for cost efficiency rather than resilience. The Russia-Ukraine War (2022) showed the dangers of single-sourced energy, as Europe scrambled to replace Russian gas at exorbitant costs. The Iberian Peninsula Blackout (2025) revealed the risks of excessive reliance on intermittent renewables without sufficient dispatchable backup. Each shock has redefined global energy thinking, proving that resilience must precede ambition. Energy transitions are not instant switches but pathways requiring foresight, balance, and redundancy. India\u2019s Current Vulnerability In 2023-24, crude oil and natural gas imports accounted for $170 billion , or more than a quarter of India\u2019s merchandise import bill. Such outflows depress the rupee, inflate the trade deficit , and constrain macroeconomic stability. The June 2025 Israel-Iran confrontation, narrowly avoiding disruption of 20 million barrels per day of global oil flows , served as a stark reminder of how external crises can instantly destabilise energy-dependent economies like India. Towards an Energy Sovereignty Doctrine Coal Gasification and Indigenous Energy With 150 billion tonnes of coal reserves, India can no longer dismiss domestic coal due to high ash content. Modern gasification and carbon capture can unlock syngas , hydrogen, methanol, and fertilizers, converting a liability into an asset. Biofuels and Rural Empowerment Ethanol blending has already reduced crude dependence and transferred over \u20b992,000 crore to farmers. Scaling bio-CNG through the SATAT scheme not only diversifies energy sources but restores soil health in North India, integrating sustainability with rural economic revival. Nuclear Power as a Dispatchable Backbone India\u2019s stagnant 8.8 GW nuclear capacity must be expanded through thorium research , uranium partnerships, and Small Modular Reactors. Nuclear power provides the reliable baseload nece ssar y in a renewable-dominated grid. Green Hydrogen and Technology Sovereignty The ambition of producing 5 million metric tonnes by 2030 requires indigenous electrolyser and catalyst industries. True sovereignty will come not from imports of green hydrogen but from mastering the technology chain itself. Pumped Hydro for Grid Inertia As renewable penetration deepens, pumped hydro offers proven large-scale storage and grid stability. India\u2019s diverse topography can be harnessed to ensure resilience against intermittency. The Age of Sovereignty India has already reduced its dependence on West Asian oil from 60% to below 45%, a deliberate strategy of diversification. Yet the future cannot rest solely on shifting suppliers. The defining competition of the 21st century will not be over oil reserves but over which nations can secure uninterrupted, affordable, and indigenous energy. The Israel-Iran ceasefire represents a narrow escape , a chance to act before the next shock. India must seize this window not with short-term fixes but with structural reforms that blend ambition with realism. Sovereignty lies not in slogans but in the patient construction of capacity across coal, biofuels, nuclear, hydrogen, and pumped hydro. Conclusion India stands at an inflection point; Every past global energy pivot has been forged in crisis. Today, India has the rare opportunity to pivot by foresight rather than force. The five foundational pillars of energy sovereignty are not peripheral to the global energy transition; they are its sovereign spine. In an uncertain century, the most precious resource will not be crude oil but uninterrupted, indigenous, and resilient energy. Building that future is no longer optional.

Integrated Air Defence Weapon System (IADWS) - India\u2019s Maiden Test of Indigenous Air Defence System Aug. 28, 2025 Context: The Defence Research and Development Organisation ( DRDO ) conducted the maiden flight test of the Integrated Air Defence Weapon System (IADWS) off the coast of Odisha. This marks a significant step in India\u2019s quest for self-reliance (Atmanirbhar Bharat) in advanced defence technology. Key Features of IADWS: Three-layered defence structure: Quick Reaction Surface-to-Air Missile ( QR-SAM ): Range 30 km. Very Short Range Air Defence System ( VSHORADS ): Range up to 6 km. Directed Energy Weapon ( DEW ): High-power laser with range 2\u20134 km. Operational mechanism: Controlled by a Centralised Command and Control Centre, developed by DRDL (Defence Research and Development Laboratory). Maiden flight test: Successfully neutralised three different aerial targets (UAVs and drones) in flight tests. DRDO\u2019s Technological Evolution: The IADWS missile defence system incorporates multiple technologies that the DRDO has developed over time, in different labs. For example , India began this technological synergising with the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) that was set up in 1983 by A P J Abdul Kalam . The IGMDP\u2019s \u201c missile cluster \u201d, which is mainly located in Hyderabad, includes 5 specialised labs: ASL (Advanced Systems Laboratory) : Developed Agni and Prithvi ballistic missiles, which were developed into a highly advanced - Anti-ballistic missile (ABM) shield, Anti-satellite (ASAT) missile system, and Multi independently targetable re-entry vehicle (MIRV) DRDL (Defence Research and Development Laboratory) : Developed tactical missiles like Trishul, Akash, Nag. Research Centre Imarat (RCI) : Specialises in navigation, guidance, homing, command and control, high-temperature materials. Terminal Ballistic Research Laboratory : Specialises in warhead design. Young Scientists Laboratory : Works in the field of emerging tech (AI, quantum computing). Public-private synergy: Transfer of DRDO technology to the private sector , for example, Carborundum Universal Limited (CUMI) licensed for manufacturing ceramic radomes (critical for missiles and aircraft under extreme heat). Global Collaborations and Strategic Partnerships: Lessons from Israel: Israel\u2019s multi-layered air defence: Iron Dome (up to 160 km); David\u2019s Sling (300 km); Arrow-3 (2,400 km); US-supplied THAAD (200 km). The technology challenge involves integrating the individual elements of the missile shield. Israel demonstrates integration of radar, interceptor missiles, and command systems. Cost-effectiveness: The Tamir (missile, that is the primary component of Iron Dome) initially cost about $1,00,000 each to produce, but the Israeli industry brought down the price to $40-$50,000. India\u2019s approach to joint development: Collaboration principle: Share strengths, complement weaknesses. For examples, BrahMos with Russia : India developed navigation and mission control. Long Range Surface-to-Air Missile (LR-SAM) like Barak 8 with Israel : India built the rear section and integration, Israel provided the seeker and front section. Rule : India avoids collaborations for systems that already exist; prefers joint development of new technology . Strategic Significance of IADWS for India: Self-reliance : Advances Atmanirbhar Bharat in defence. Synergised R&D: Integrates multiple labs\u2019 expertise into battlefield-ready systems. Geopolitical leverage : Enhances India\u2019s ability to deter combined threats from Pakistan and China. Industrial growth : Public-private partnerships (PPP) foster indigenous defence manufacturing. Future scope : Scope for international collaboration in advanced air defence systems. Conclusion: The successful test of the IADWS signals India\u2019s steady progress towards building a multi-layered, indigenously developed air defence architecture that reduces external dependence. Going forward, synergising public-private capacities with selective global collaborations can enable India to evolve into a major hub for advanced defence technologies and strengthen its strategic autonomy.

GDP Growth Rate for Q1 FY26 Hits 7.8% - Fastest in Five Quarters Aug. 30, 2025 Why in the News? India\u2019s GDP grew 7.8% in Q1 FY26 , the fastest in five quarters, driven by strong manufacturing, services, and construction despite US tariff headwinds. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? GDP Growth (Introduction, GDP Growth, Sectoral Growth, Global & Domestic Headwinds, Consumption & Investment Trends, Outlook, etc.) Introduction India\u2019s economy registered an impressive 7.8% GDP growth in the first quarter of FY26 (April-June 2025) , its fastest pace in five quarters. This surge was fuelled by strong performances in manufacturing, services, and construction sectors , consolidating India\u2019s position as the world\u2019s fastest-growing large economy . The growth comes at a critical juncture when global trade is under pressure due to the US imposing steep tariffs on Indian goods, testing the resilience of the Indian economy. Sectoral Performance Driving Growth Manufacturing Momentum The manufacturing sector expanded 7.7% , a significant improvement over the 4.8% recorded in January-March 2025 and slightly above the 7.6% in the same quarter last year. This indicates robust industrial demand despite external trade uncertainties. Construction and Infrastructure Construction activity maintained a 7.6% growth rate , though slower than the 10.1% posted in Q1 FY25. Despite moderation, the sector\u2019s resilience reflects steady infrastructure investments and housing demand. Services Sector as the Growth Engine The services sector grew 9.3% , its highest in two years. Within this: Public Administration, Defence & Other Services surged 9.8%, indicating higher government expenditure. Financial, Real Estate & Professional Services grew 9.5%, aided by financial sector expansion. Trade, Hotels, Transport, and Communication posted 8.6% growth, reflecting recovery in travel and consumer demand. Agriculture and Utilities Agriculture grew by 3.7% , more than double last year\u2019s growth of 1.5%, highlighting rural sector strength. However, the electricity, gas, water supply, and utilities sector slowed sharply to just 0.5% , partly due to heavy rains reducing power demand. Global and Domestic Headwinds US Tariff Impact On August 27, 2025 , the US imposed a 50% tariff on Indian exports , including textiles, gems, and engineering goods. While the move raised concerns about export-linked jobs and consumption, India\u2019s Chief Economic Advisor emphasised that the impact would be \u201cmodest\u201d and demand growth would hold up. GST and Tax Reforms The government has sought to bolster demand by lowering indirect tax rates and pushing for GST rationalisation , expected to further stimulate consumption in the festival season. Additionally, direct tax cuts announced in the Union Budget 2025-26 continue to support disposable incomes. Consumption and Investment Trends Private consumption expenditure grew 7% , slower than the 8.3% in the previous year but an improvement over the previous quarter\u2019s 6%. Investment demand, measured through Gross Fixed Capital Formation , expanded 7.8% , showing continued corporate and infrastructure investments. Government expenditure also rebounded strongly, rising 7.4% , after contracting in the prior quarter. Outlook for FY26 Despite tariff headwinds, policymakers and economists remain confident of India maintaining its growth trajectory: The government expects FY26 GDP growth in the 6.3-6.8% range , retaining India\u2019s global growth leadership. Nominal GDP growth stood at 8.8% , the lowest in three quarters, but still supportive of corporate earnings growth. Economists caution that low inflation boosted real GDP growth figures; sustained reforms and export diversification will be critical. newspaper.pdf ( Size: 561.4 KB ) Latest Article See All IndiGo Meltdown Dec. 5, 2025, 2:34 p.m. Economics India to Expand Its Busiest Rail Corridors: What\u2019s Planned Dec. 5, 2025, 2:08 p.m. Economics Census 2027 - Counting India, Renewing the Republic Dec. 5, 2025, 1:54 p.m. Editorial Analysis Health and National Security Cess on Demerit Goods Dec. 5, 2025, 1:48 p.m. Economics A Missing Link in India\u2019s Mineral Mission Dec. 5, 2025, 1:33 p.m. Editorial Analysis A Day to Pause and Come Down to Earth Dec. 5, 2025, 1:27 p.m. Editorial Analysis Rupee Breaches the 90-Mark Dec. 4, 2025, 1:36 p.m. Economics Putin\u2019s Visit: India\u2013Russia Ties and the Road Ahead Dec. 4, 2025, 1:24 p.m. International Relations Judiciary Flags Major Lapses in Critical Care for Acid Attack Survivors Dec. 4, 2025, 1:13 p.m. Polity & Governance India\u2019s Seven-Point Energy Transition Agenda for 2035 Dec. 4, 2025, 1:05 p.m. Editorial Analysis", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

Detoxifying India\u2019s Entrance Examination System Aug. 30, 2025 Context Every year, nearly 70 lakh students in India vie for a limited number of undergraduate seats through highly competitive entrance examinations such as JEE, NEET, CUET, and CLAT. The scarcity of seats in premier institutions has not only fuelled a multibillion-rupee coaching industry but also entrenched a culture of relentless pressure. Recent controversies , from financial misconduct at coaching centres to tragic student suicides, highlight the cracks in this system. It is time to reimagine undergraduate admissions in India, shifting from a model of hyper-competition to one that prioritises fairness, equity , and student well-being. The Coaching Crisis and Its Toll The rise of the coaching industry is perhaps the most visible symptom of the problem. With 15 lakh aspirants for the JEE alone, centres charge exorbitant fees , often \u20b96\u20137 lakh for two years, pushing families into financial strain. Students as young as 14 are enrolled in rigorous programmes where they spend their adolescence solving advanced problems from Irodov and Krotov, far beyond the needs of an undergraduate curriculum. This comes at a steep cost: stress, depression, social isolation, and in tragic cases, loss of life. Governments have attempted to regulate coaching centres, but regulation misses the root issue: the entrance examination system itself. By treating minuscule percentile differences as decisive , the system sidelines capable students while favouring those with financial means. What should matter a solid grasp of school-level physics, chemistry, and mathematics, is overshadowed by the artificial hierarchy created by rankings. The Illusion of Meritocracy At its core, the system perpetuates an illusion of meritocracy. Harvard philosopher Michael Sandel has argued that societies become toxic when success is seen purely as a reflection of individual superiority, ignoring the roles of privilege and chance. In India, this illusion is intensified: a student from an affluent urban family with access to elite coaching is far more likely to secure a top rank than a rural student with equal potential but fewer resources. What results is not true merit, but stratified access disguised as fairness. Learning from Global Models India need not reinvent the wheel. International experiences provide valuable lessons. The Netherlands, for instance, has implemented a weighted lottery for medical school admissions, ensuring that all students above a minimum threshold have a fair chance, while higher grades only marginally improve odds. This system reduces bias, promotes diversity, and eases pressure , recognising that fine-grained distinctions in scores are both irrelevant and unjust. Similarly, China\u2019s 2021 \u201cdouble reduction\u201d policy radically curtailed for-profit tutoring , nationalising education support to reduce financial burdens and protect student well-being. Both cases demonstrate that systemic reform is not only possible but also effective in balancing excellence with equity. The Path Forward: A Vision for India For India, the way forward lies in simplifying admissions and trusting the school system. Class 12 board examinations already provide a rigorous curriculum sufficient to gauge readiness for higher education. A threshold, say, 80% in physics, chemistry, and mathematics, could serve as the eligibility bar. Within this pool, seats could be allotted through a weighted lottery, with higher scores modestly improving chances but not monopolising opportunity. Reservation policies could be integrated, with special emphasis on rural and government school student s to ensure mobility and social justice. If entrance examinations are retained, they should be delinked from private profit . Coaching could be banned or nationalised, with free online materials made universally available. To further dismantle the hierarchy among IITs, an annual student exchange programme and inter-campus faculty transfers could create diversity, integration , and uniform academic standards. Conclusion Ultimately, the question is whether India will continue a toxic rat race that scars its youth or embrace a system rooted in fairness , sanity, and egalitarianism. Moving to a lottery-based admissions process would free students from the treadmill of coaching, restore adolescence as a time for learning and growth, and make elite education accessible to all qualified students, not just the privileged few. India\u2019s education system stands at a crossroads and the choice is between perpetuating a narrow definition of merit that privileges wealth and burns out its brightest, or adopting a model that balances excellence with compassion and equality. The path forward is clear, one that allows young people to thrive as learners, citizens, and human beings, not mere machines chasing percentiles.

A team of international scientists has identified an extremely rare quadruple star system in the Milky Way, named UPM J1040\u22123551 AabBab . The system features a pair of cold brown dwarfs orbiting two young red dwarf stars \u2014 a configuration never observed before. The study was published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (September issue). Scientists say this discovery is significant as it provides fresh insights into brown dwarfs , celestial objects that are notoriously hard to detect and study, helping improve understanding of their properties and role in stellar evolution. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Young Red Dwarf Stars Brown Dwarfs: The \u201cFailed Stars\u201d Why Brown Dwarfs Are Hard to Detect Importance of Studying Brown Dwarfs Young Red Dwarf Stars Young red dwarf stars are small, relatively cool stars in the early stages of their long lifetimes. They are the most common type of stars in the Milky Way. High radiation : They are characterized by strong magnetic activity, leading to intense ultraviolet (UV) radiation and violent superflares, which can pose significant challenges to planetary atmospheres and life. Size & Temperature : They are smaller and cooler than our Sun, with surface temperatures ranging from about 2,500\u00b0C to 4,000\u00b0C. Longevity : Red dwarfs burn hydrogen fuel very slowly, allowing them to live for tens to hundreds of billions of years, far longer than stars like the Sun. Youth factor : When they are young, red dwarfs are more active, often emitting intense stellar flares and strong radiation. Importance in astronomy : Studying young red dwarfs helps scientists understand stellar evolution, the habitability of surrounding exoplanets, and how such stars influence planetary atmospheres. Proximity to Earth: The nearest star to our Sun, Proxima Centauri, is a red dwarf, highlighting the abundance and significance of these stars in our galactic neighbourhood. Brown Dwarfs: The \u201cFailed Stars\u201d Brown dwarfs are unique celestial objects that form like stars from collapsing gas and dust but lack the mass to sustain hydrogen fusion , which powers normal stars. This limitation makes them faint and cooler, earning them the nickname \u201cfailed stars.\u201d Despite this, they share characteristics with gas giants such as Jupiter and Saturn, having similar atmospheres filled with molecules like water vapor. Brown dwarfs can be massive\u2014reaching up to 70 times the mass of Jupiter \u2014yet remain distinct from true stars, occupying the gap between planets and stars in the cosmic family. Why Brown Dwarfs Are Hard to Detect? Brown dwarfs are extremely cold and faint , making them difficult to observe directly. To study them, astronomers often track brown dwarfs that orbit brighter companion stars, since both objects are usually born together from the same material. By analysing the brighter stars, scientists can estimate the age, temperature, and composition of the dimmer brown dwarfs. The recent discovery of the quadruple star system UPM J1040\u22123551 AabBab is remarkable because it contains two T-type brown dwarfs, each about the size of Jupiter, orbiting two young red dwarf stars . Such a configuration is exceptionally rare \u2014 the probability of a low-mass brown dwarf having a companion is less than 5%, making this finding a valuable opportunity to deepen our understanding of these elusive \u201cfailed stars.\u201d Importance of Studying Brown Dwarfs Brown dwarfs help astronomers understand the processes behind star and planet formation , since they occupy the middle ground between the two. Mapping their abundance and distribution also provides crucial insights into how mass is spread across the universe . This is particularly significant because much of the universe\u2019s mass remains unseen, existing as dark matter , and studying brown dwarfs offers valuable clues to this cosmic mystery.

Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, recently addressed the National Conference of Chairpersons of Parliamentary and Legislature Committees on Welfare of SCs and STs. He highlighted the increasing importance of parliamentary committees in India in ensuring accountability. He also highlighted the declining quality of dialogue, decorum, and discussion in legislatures. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Historical Evolution and Structure of Parliamentary Committees in India Need for Parliamentary Committees Role of Parliamentary and Legislature Committees Significant Contributions of Parliamentary Committees in India Concerns Raised About Parliamentary and Legislature Committees The Road Ahead Conclusion Historical Evolution and Structure of Parliamentary Committees in India: Historical evolution : Even though a structured committee system was only established in 1993 , individual committees were being formed for various reasons as far back as independence. For instance , the Ad Hoc Committee on the Citizenship Clause. Structure : Standing committees : Permanent, subject-specific (finance, defence, etc.). Ad Hoc committees : Temporary, for specific purposes. Joint committees : Drawn from both Houses for common issues. For example , the JPC to evaluate the feasibility of implementing the \u2018 One Nation, One Election \u2019 initiative. Specialised committees : e.g., Business Advisory Committee, Committee on Papers Laid on the Table. Need for Parliamentary Committees: Volume of work : The Parliament cannot deliberate on all issues on the floor due to time and procedural constraints. Beyond legislation : Committees handle sector-specific concerns, welfare oversight, financial scrutiny, and executive accountability. Behind-the-scenes contribution : Every Bill, debate, and parliamentary procedure is supported by committee work, often invisible to the public eye. Role of Parliamentary and Legislature Committees: Accountability and transparency : Committees scrutinize government functioning, schemes, and expenditure. Bipartisan nature and consensus building : Panels function above party lines, making them crucial for effective governance. Oversight on spending : Demand for Grants reports highlight expenditure gaps (e.g., Panchayati Raj Ministry\u2019s under-utilisation of funds in 2022-23). Impactful interventions : Empowered to recommend improvements in implementation of schemes for SCs and STs, ensure budget allocations reach intended beneficiaries. Significant Contributions of Parliamentary Committees in India: Digital Data Protection Bill: From Justice Srikrishna Committee (2017) \u2192 Joint Parliamentary Committee (2021) \u2192 Draft Digital Personal Data Protection Bill (2022). Major legislations referred: Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill. Anti-Maritime Piracy Bill. Jan Vishwas Bill. Wildlife Protection (Amendment) Bill. Competition (Amendment) Bill, Electricity Bill, Criminal Procedure (Identification) Bill. Public Accounts Committee (2015) : Flagged inefficiencies in defence shipyards \u2014 cost overruns, delays, inadequate practices. Concerns Raised About Parliamentary and Legislature Committees: Decline in deliberation : Reduced debates and disruptions in both Lok Sabha and state assemblies. For example, only 60% bills referred to these committees in the 14th Lok Sabha, 15th Lok Sabha (71%), 16th Lok Sabha (25%), and 17th Lok Sabha (16%), highlighting their declining role in legislative/ expert scrutiny . Language and conduct : Falling standards of parliamentary behaviour. Example : recent Monsoon Session of Parliament marred by daily disruptions over electoral roll revision in Bihar. Political polarisation: Committees could lose their influence. Lack of binding power: Recommendations often ignored. The Road Ahead: Compulsory referral of Bills: As in the U.S., every Bill should be scrutinised by relevant committees before passing. Strengthening powers: To avoid becoming \u201ctoothless tigers,\u201d committees need more authority to enforce accountability. Institutionalisation : Formalise processes to prevent political expediency from bypassing scrutiny. Preserve consensus mechanism : Committees must remain bipartisan spaces of constructive deliberation. Conclusion: Strengthening the committee system is essential to revive deliberative democracy in India , as it provides a bipartisan space for scrutiny, accountability, and consensus-building. Empowering parliamentary committees in India with greater authority can ensure more informed, inclusive, and transparent law-making in the years ahead. newspaper.pdf ( Size: 840.9 KB ) Latest Article See All IndiGo Meltdown Dec. 5, 2025, 2:34 p.m. Economics India to Expand Its Busiest Rail Corridors: What\u2019s Planned Dec. 5, 2025, 2:08 p.m. Economics Census 2027 - Counting India, Renewing the Republic Dec. 5, 2025, 1:54 p.m. Editorial Analysis Health and National Securit", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

Kerala\u2019s Digital Literacy Feat: How the State Achieved Widespread Inclusion Aug. 31, 2025 Why in news? Recently, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan declared Kerala as the first fully digitally literate State in India after completing the first phase of the Digi Kerala programme. The initiative, implemented through local self-government bodies, aimed to bridge the digital divide. As part of the effort, 21.87 lakh people identified as digitally illiterate were trained and successfully cleared evaluations, marking a milestone in grassroots digital empowerment. Trainees unfamiliar with digital devices learned to make voice and video calls on smartphones, use WhatsApp and social media, access government services, and perform digital transactions. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Origins of Kerala\u2019s Digital Literacy Drive Scaling Up the Pullampara Model Statewide Digi Kerala 2.0: Expanding the Mission Origins of Kerala\u2019s Digital Literacy Drive Kerala\u2019s Digi Kerala programme stemmed from a local initiative in Pullampara panchayat , Thiruvananthapuram, in 2021. Officials noticed long queues outside banks, where daily-wage and MGNREGS labourers often lost a day\u2019s income just to check balances. This hardship inspired the idea of teaching basic digital skills to reduce dependency on physical banking. Launch of Digi Pullampara The panchayat launched the Digi Pullampara project , surveying wards to identify 3,917 digitally illiterate residents. Of these, 3,300 were trained, while bedridden individuals were excluded. The training included 15 activities in three modules , covering essential digital tasks. Role of Volunteers and Training Methods Volunteers, including students from NSS units , Kudumbashree members, SC/ST promoters, and library council members, conducted the training. Sessions were held at MGNREGS worksites, Kudumbashree neighbourhood groups, and even in households for senior citizens. After training, evaluations tested whether participants could perform at least six out of 15 tasks ; retraining was offered to those who failed. Success and Statewide Expansion Pullampara achieved 96.18% success , becoming Kerala\u2019s first fully digitally literate panchayat in September 2022. Encouraged by this, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan announced the expansion of the initiative across the State , ultimately shaping Kerala\u2019s digital literacy revolution. Scaling Up the Pullampara Model Statewide To expand the Digi Pullampara model , the government brought Pullampara\u2019s core team to the Kerala Institute of Local Administration to train master trainers. These trainers, in turn, prepared 2.57 lakh volunteers across the State. Survey and Training Process Following the model of the Total Literacy Campaign of the 1980s , surveys covered 1.51 crore people across 83.45 lakh households , identifying 21.88 lakh digitally illiterate individuals . Training followed a structured process, and the Economics and Statistics Department conducted third-party evaluations. Out of those trained, 21 . 87 lakh passed . Panchayats with more than 10% failures were provided re-training . Inclusivity Beyond Guidelines Unlike the National Digital Literacy Mission , which mandates training only up to 60 years of age, Kerala included all age groups , even those over 100. Data shows 15,221 trainees above 90 years, 7.77 lakh between 60\u201375 years, and 1.35 lakh between 76\u201390 years were trained. Wide Participation Across Communities The programme saw participation from over 13 lakh women, eight lakh men, and 1,644 transgender persons , showcasing its inclusive approach. Officials noted that Kudumbashree workers helped volunteers focus only on households where residents were not already digitally literate, ensuring better targeting. Digi Kerala 2.0: Expanding the Mission At the Digi Kerala declaration , the Chief Minister launched Digi Kerala 2.0 , which will go beyond basic digital skills. It will include awareness classes on cyber fraud, training to identify and reject fake news, and intensive sessions on accessing government services digitally. Smartphone-Centric Approach Unlike the national digital literacy programmes that focus mainly on computer use, Kerala has prioritised smartphones as the key tool for navigating daily life, reflecting ground realities. Integration with Broader Projects The initiative forms part of Kerala\u2019s larger digital vision, integrated with: Kerala Fibre Optic Network (KFON): Ensures universal Internet access, offering free connectivity to BPL families (14,000 connected so far, plus 74,203 commercial homes). K-SMART Project: Aims to bring all local self-government services onto a single digital platform , enhancing accessibility and governance efficiency. This roadmap positions Kerala not only as India\u2019s first fully digitally literate state , but also as a model for bridging the digital divide Kerala\u2019s Digital Literacy Feat - How the State Achieved Widespread Inclusion.pdf ( Size: 596.5 KB )", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

ISRO successfully conducted its first Integrated Air Drop Test (IADT-1) , marking a key step for the Gaganyaan human spaceflight mission. A five-tonne dummy crew capsule was released from a helicopter to evaluate its parachute-based deceleration system for safe splashdown. The test validated critical safety mechanisms needed to ensure astronaut survival during re-entry and landing. While the first uncrewed mission is expected by late 2025 , India\u2019s first crewed spaceflight is planned for 2027 . What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Integrated Air Drop Test Execution of the Air Drop Test Current Status of the Gaganyaan Mission India\u2019s Long-Term Human Spaceflight Goals Integrated Air Drop Test An Integrated Air Drop Test (IADT) simulates the final phase of a spacecraft\u2019s return to Earth by dropping it from an aircraft or helicopter. This allows engineers to evaluate critical systems such as parachute deployment in abort scenarios, performance during partial parachute failure, and crew module safety during splashdown. However, it cannot fully replicate actual re-entry conditions , since helicopters cannot reach sufficient altitudes. To address this, ISRO conducts sub-orbital or orbital tests \u2014such as the Test Vehicle Abort Mission (TV-D1) in October 2023 \u2014to validate the crew escape system and performance under real re-entry conditions. Purpose of IADT-1 IADT-1 was conducted to evaluate the parachute-based deceleration system crucial for safely bringing back the Gaganyaan crew module after re-entry. In this test, an uncrewed capsule was dropped from a helicopter at about 3 km altitude, with parachutes expected to deploy in a precise sequence. The process simulated the final stages of a real mission, where the capsule is slowed first by atmospheric drag and heat shields, then by drogue parachutes, and finally by three large main parachutes. The goal was to ensure the capsule reduced its speed to about 8 m/s before splashdown. IADT-1 in the Gaganyaan Roadmap In the broader roadmap, IADT-1 lies between TV-D1 (2023 abort test) and the G1 uncrewed mission (late 2025) , forming part of a sequence of thousands of tests ISRO must complete before human flight. Execution of the Air Drop Test The air drop test simulated a launch pad abort scenario where astronauts would need emergency ejection. A 4.8-tonne dummy crew module was dropped from 3 km altitude using a Chinook helicopter. Once released, the onboard avionics autonomously triggered deceleration and deployed 10 parachutes, which slowed the module to a safe splashdown speed of about 8 m/s. For comparison, parachutes in real re-entry missions typically deploy at around 150 m/s. The test also confirmed the crew module\u2019s orientation and recovery process during splashdown. Current Status of the Gaganyaan Mission The Gaganyaan mission aims to send Indian astronauts to low-earth orbit by 2027 . To achieve this, ISRO is conducting a series of rigorous tests to validate safety and mission systems. Test Vehicle Missions After the success of Test Vehicle Abort Mission-1 (TV-D1) , ISRO is preparing TV-D2 , scheduled for the third quarter of 2025 . This will simulate a more complex abort scenario and validate the crew escape system . Uncrewed Demonstration Missions The first uncrewed mission, Gaganyaan-1 (G-1) , is planned for the fourth quarter of 2025 . It will test technology preparedness, using an unpressurised crew module without the Environment Control and Life Support System (ECLSS). Two additional uncrewed missions, G-2 and G-3 , are also scheduled for launch next year to further validate systems. Hardware and Systems Preparedness Crew module and service module structures have been manufactured. Propulsion systems for the crew module, service module, and crew escape system have been tested. The LVM3 rocket has been fully human-rated , incorporating redundancies for crew safety. A Life Support System model has also been built. Infrastructure and Facilities Key facilities are complete: Orbital Module Preparation Facility, Gaganyaan Control Centre, crew training facility, and launch pad modifications . A recovery plan for the crew module after splashdown has also been finalised. India\u2019s Long-Term Human Spaceflight Goals The Gaganyaan mission is only the first step in India\u2019s broader human spaceflight roadmap. The government has set ambitious targets, including establishing the Bharatiya Antariksh Station (BAS) by 2035 and achieving an Indian crewed lunar landing by 2040 . These milestones will require repeated missions, long-duration stays in orbit, and advanced deep-space technologies. Progress may face delays \u2014 for instance, IADT-1 was pushed from April 2024 to August 2025 \u2014 but each milestone strengthens India\u2019s capabilities.

Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Act, 2025 \u2013 Constitutional, Legal and Policy Debates Aug. 29, 2025 Context: The Indian Parliament recently passed the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Act, 2025, after minimal debate. The Act bans online real-money games like rummy and poker while claiming to promote innovation and protect against socio-economic, public health, and privacy concerns. The law raises constitutional, legal, and policy questions about the Union Government\u2019s competence and proportionality of restrictions on individual liberty. Key Features of the Act: About the law: It ostensibly aims to promote online gaming and protect individuals with respect to social, economic and privacy-related concerns. Objective: To secure a safe, innovation-friendly digital environment while addressing the public health, public morality and financial sovereignty risks of online gaming. Provisions: To completely ban all online games involving real money, such as rummy and poker. Thus, the law retains \u201cpromotion\u201d rhetoric but adopts a prohibitive approach. Union vs State Powers: Constitutional allocation: Following subjects primarily lies in the State domain as per Schedule VII List II (State List) of the Indian constitution - Sports, entertainments, amusements Betting and gambling Public health, trade and commerce Issue: By regulating online gaming, the union government assumes legislative competence by citing public interest. This raises federalism concerns since the subject lies in the State domain. Government\u2019s Rationale: Addiction and mental health: Due to the temptation of these \"predatory gaming platforms,\" Indian youth are rapidly spiralling into financial instability and mental health crises (WHO). Cybersecurity and financial risks: Unlike offline games, software coding in online games can manipulate odds against players. Online games are vulnerable to fraud, money laundering, identity concealment . Moral and social grounds: Online money gaming are seen as predatory platforms exploiting youth. Critical Issues and Debates: Liberty and proportionality: Ban restricts adult autonomy in a free country. Constitutional law demands that restrictions be rational, necessary, suitable, proportionate. Current ban risks being seen as excessive and paternalistic. Rational nexus question: Does banning online real-money games actually prevent mental/financial crises? Risk of underground, unregulated markets that are accessible through VPNs and dark web. Policy alternatives: Instead of outright ban, possible regulatory measures are - Licensing of gaming companies. Strict fiscal controls and limits on the stakes players choose to play for. Age restrictions and player verification. Taxation and monitoring for accountability. Socio-economic considerations: Need for mental health support systems . Employment creation as an alternative to risky online earnings. Unanswered Questions: Why differentiate between online and offline real-money games? Is prohibition more effective than strict regulation? Does Union intervention violate the federal spirit of the Constitution? How will enforcement tackle cross-border digital platforms? Conclusion: The future of online gaming regulation in India must move beyond prohibition towards a balanced framework of accountability, innovation, and player protection, ensuring that risks are addressed without undermining federalism or individual liberty . A nuanced regulatory approach with licensing, safeguards, and mental health interventions can transform the sector into a source of responsible entertainment, economic growth, and digital innovation.

Composition of the Gangotri Glacier System (GGS) New Study on Gangotri Glacier System (GGS) Key Findings of the Study Implications of the Study on GGS Composition of the Gangotri Glacier System (GGS) The GGS comprises four glaciers \u2014 Meru (7 km\u00b2), Raktavaran (30 km\u00b2), Chaturangi (75 km\u00b2), and the largest, Gangotri (140 km\u00b2). Together, the system spans 549 km\u00b2 , with about 48% glacierised area , across elevations from 3,767 m to 7,072 m . The GGS receives precipitation from western disturbances in winter (October\u2013April) and the Indian summer monsoon in summer (May\u2013September) . Seasonal rainfall (May\u2013October) averages 260 mm , with a mean temperature of 9.4\u00b0C recorded between 2000\u20132003. New Study on Gangotri Glacier System (GGS) The Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) holds vital snow and ice reserves that feed major rivers like the Indus, Ganga, and Brahmaputra, sustaining millions of lives. In recent decades, climatic changes have altered the cryosphere and hydrological cycles , leading to faster glacial retreat and shifting seasonal discharge patterns. While most modelling studies focus on large river catchments, it is difficult to separate the impacts of snowmelt and precipitation there. Smaller systems like the GGS allow for more precise assessments, making it a preferred choice for hydrologists and climate scientists. However, long-term discharge analysis and understanding climatic drivers have remained limited. To address this, a new study titled \u201c Hydrological Contributions of Snow and Glacier Melt from the Gangotri Glacier System and Their Climatic Controls Since 1980 \u201d was conducted. The study, published in the Journal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing, provides deeper insights into GGS\u2019s meltwater contributions and climate influences. Key Findings of the Study The study combined the Spatial Processes in Hydrology (SPHY) glacio-hydrological model with the Indian Monsoon Data Assimilation and Analysis (IMDAA) dataset (1980\u20132020) to reconstruct GGS discharge trends. SPHY model is a hydrological modelling tool suitable for a wide range of water resource management applications. It found that maximum discharge occurs in summer , peaking in July (129 m\u00b3/s) . The mean annual discharge was estimated at 28\u00b11.9 m\u00b3/s , primarily from snow melt (64%) , followed by glacier melt (21%) , rainfall-runoff (11%) , and base flow (4%) . A decadal analysis revealed a shift in discharge peaks from August to July after 1990 , linked to reduced winter precipitation and enhanced early summer melting . The highest volumetric increase (7.8%) occurred between 1991\u20132000 and 2001\u20132010 . While mean annual temperatures rose, there was no significant trend in precipitation or glacier melt . Snow melt declined due to shrinking snow cover, whereas rainfall-runoff and base flow increased . The analysis highlighted that summer precipitation was the main driver of annual discharge, followed by winter temperature . Implications of the Study on GGS The findings highlight warming-induced hydrological changes in the Gangotri Glacier System (GGS), with increasing rainfall run-off and base flow. This aligns with the 25% excess rainfall observed in North India\u2019s summer monsoon (June\u2013August), which has caused frequent floods in Uttarakhand, Jammu, and Himachal Pradesh. While such events are often hastily termed \u201ccloudbursts\u201d without scientific evidence, climate change does raise the risk of extreme rainfall. The study stresses the need for sustained field monitoring and advanced modelling to improve water resource management in glacier-fed river basins, ensuring resilience against future hydrological and climatic shifts.

Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) - A Global Model for Financial Inclusion Aug. 27, 2025 Context: Financial Inclusion is vital for empowering individuals, fostering growth, reducing poverty, and promoting social equality. The Indian government-backed financial inclusion drive, launched through the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) on 28 August 2014 , aimed at universal access to banking services, especially for the marginalised sections. Genesis and Objectives of PMJDY: Genesis of PMJDY: When PMJDY was launched, approximately 7.5 crore households did not have bank accounts. Objectives of PMJDY : It aimed to provide universal access to banking services and ensure that every household, particularly the marginalised, could participate in the formal financial system. Focus of PMJDY: It focuses on Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), elimination of informal credit, and promotion of savings and insurance culture. Achievements of PMJDY: Bank account penetration: Pre-PMJDY: Only 59% of Indian households and 35% of adults had bank accounts. Post-PMJDY (2024): Nearly 100% households and over 90% adults have bank accounts. World Bank\u2019s Findex report: Account ownership in India in 2024 increased to 89% with respect to individuals aged 15 years and more. NSS survey 2022-23: It states that 94.65% of adults in the country own a bank account. Account growth: Over 56.2 crore accounts have been opened , a nearly four-fold increase from March 2015. This includes 37.5 crore accounts in rural/semi-urban areas and 18.7 crore in urban areas. Women account holders: Women hold 56% of these accounts, showcasing PMJDY\u2019s strong focus on gender inclusion. Total deposits: The total balance in PMJDY accounts stands at Rs 2.68 lakh crore, a 17-fold increase since 2015. Banking network expansion: Over 16.2 lakh bank mitras (business correspondents) deliver banking services in remote areas. 99.9% villages now have a banking outlet (branch, business correspondent or India Post Payments Bank) within 5 km. Role of PMJDY in Welfare and Crisis Management: PMJDY accounts have streamlined DBT and ensured that subsidies and relief payments reach beneficiaries without intermediaries. During demonetisation and the Covid crisis , PMJDY accounts facilitated rapid financial support. Financial Products and Digital Integration: The scheme has promoted digital transactions through RuPay cards . For example , over 38.7 crore RuPay cards have been issued under the scheme. PMJDY accounts are being used not only for receiving DBT but also facilitated - For savings Provided access to micro-insurance and investment products . For example , extending life and accident cover (Jan Suraksha) of Rs 2 lakh through the PMJJBY and the PMSBY . Much-needed financial security (to people working in the unorganised segment) by enrolling in Jan Suraksha schemes. The scheme has also boosted UPI and digital transactions growth . Future Prospects: Artificial intelligence and natural language processing can help in voice-based transaction authorisations, doing away with the need for smartphones or internet connectivity. Facilitated innovations in e-commerce with fast and reliable delivery systems in Tier 4 and Tier 5 centres. The government has launched a financial inclusion saturation drive , and banks are organising camps to - Update KYC details, Open new accounts, Promote micro-insurance and pension schemes, and Reduce inactive accounts under PMJDY. Conclusion: PMJDY is the world\u2019s largest financial inclusion programme , which acts as a testament to inclusive governance , and recognised as a global model for universal financial inclusion. As PMJDY enters its 12th year , the focus must shift from mere account creation to enhancing account activity , financial literacy, and access to diversified financial products like insurance, credit, and pensions. Leveraging digital innovations and deeper outreach in rural and unorganised sectors can transform PMJDY into a catalyst for inclusive and sustainable economic growth .

The Gender Angle to India\u2019s Economic Vulnerabilities Aug. 27, 2025 Context India\u2019s rapid economic ascent, now valued at $4.19 trillion , has cemented its place as a rising global powerhouse and positioned to soon become the world\u2019s third-largest economy, India\u2019s growth narrative is compelling. Yet, this trajectory faces fresh challenges, particularly considering the United States\u2019 proposed 50% tariffs on Indian exports. Targeting $40 billion in trade, these tariffs could potentially shave off nearly 1% from India\u2019s GDP, striking hardest at labour-intensive sectors such as textiles, gems, leather, and footwear. Notably, these industries disproportionately employ women, making the tariff shock both an economic and gendered crisis. The Gendered Vulnerability of India\u2019s Economy Unlike China, which has weathered U.S. tariffs through its sheer manufacturing scale and diversified export base, India remains comparatively exposed. With the U.S. accounting for 18% of Indian exports, the imposition of steep tariffs could saddle Indian exporters with a 30\u201335% cost disadvantage against competitors such as Vietnam. This vulnerability is magnified by India\u2019s underutilisation of half its population . Women\u2019s economic participation is not only a matter of equality but also a strategic necessity. Sectors at risk from the tariff shock employ nearly 50 million people, with millions of women standing to lose their livelihoods. India\u2019s female labour force participation rate ( FLFPR) remains stuck between 37% and 41.7%, significantly lower than the global average and China\u2019s 60%. The International Monetary Fund estimates that closing this gender gap could boost India\u2019s GDP by 27% over the long term. Yet, cultural barriers, policy inertia, and systemic obstacles continue to stifle women\u2019s employment. The looming tariff crisis exposes this neglect as a liability for India\u2019s growth ambitions. The Demographic Dividend Dilemma India\u2019s demographic dividend, its bulging working-age population, offers a fleeting window of opportunity expected to close by 2045. Countries such as China, Japan, and the U.S. capitalised on similar moments to fuel decades of prosperity, but India risks squandering its chance . Low female participation threatens to convert this demographic boon into a demographic burden. In rural areas, women\u2019s labour has inched upward, but largely in unpaid and low-productivity family roles. In urban centres, participation has stagnated, constrained by safety concerns , unreliable public transport, poor sanitation, and the weight of unpaid care responsibilities. Without decisive action, India risks the fate of Southern European economies such as Italy and Greece, where persistently low female labour participation has dragged down growth. The Way Forward Global Lessons Global experiences offer a roadmap for reform. During World War II, the U.S. integrated women into the labour force with policies guaranteeing equal pay and childcare support. China\u2019s post-1978 reforms raised female participation to 60% through investments in care and education. Japan, by boosting its FLFPR from 63% to 70%, lifted GDP per capita by 4%. The Netherlands pioneered flexible part-time work with full benefits , a model especially relevant for India, where many women prefer such arrangements. Structural Reforms India lags behind on all three fronts: legal protections, care infrastructure, and skill development. Instead of resorting to short-term populism or blanket welfare, the country must embrace structural reforms that view women not as passive beneficiaries but as active economic agents. Some promising models already exist. Karnataka\u2019s Shakti scheme, which provides free bus travel for women, has boosted female ridership by 40% since 2023, improving mobility and independence. Gig platforms such as Urban Company employ over 15,000 women , offering them income, insurance, maternity benefits, and skill development. Rajasthan\u2019s Indira Gandhi Urban Employment Guarantee Scheme has created millions of jobs, with women comprising 65% of its workforce , many entering the labour market for the first time. These initiatives show that when mobility, safety, and flexible work opportunities are prioritised, women can meaningfully contribute to economic growth. Conclusion The impending tariff shock from the U.S. should not be seen merely as a trade dispute but as a wake-up call for India. External vulnerabilities intersect with internal shortcomings , particularly the chronic underemployment of women. Empowering women is not a gesture of social justice alone ; it is the linchpin of India\u2019s future growth. India now stands at a crossroads. By investing in its women, the nation can secure resilience and inclusive prosperity, on the other hand, by neglecting them, it risks stagnation and fragility.

Recently, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick labelled the H-1B visa program a \u201cscam,\u201d arguing it allows foreign workers to take jobs that should go to Americans. His remarks align with the Trump administration\u2019s stance who oppose the program for allegedly undercutting domestic workers. However, the H-1B continues to have strong supporters, including Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who highlight its role in bringing global talent to the US. The program remains particularly significant for Indians, who accounted for over 72% of approved H-1B petitions in 2023. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Overview of the H-1B Visa Program Immigration Politics and Criticism of H-1B Visas in the US Indians as the Largest Beneficiaries of H-1B Defence of the Program Trump\u2019s Proposed Overhaul of H-1B Overview of the H-1B Visa Program The H-1B is a temporary, non-immigrant visa that enables US employers to hire foreign workers in specialized fields like technology, engineering, and finance. Launched in 1990, it allows US employers to hire skilled foreign professionals in jobs requiring at least a bachelor\u2019s degree. It was designed to help businesses access skills unavailable in the domestic workforce by permitting temporary employment of qualified immigrants. The visa can be granted for up to six years, after which holders must either leave the US for at least 12 months or obtain permanent residency (Green Card). H-1B Visa Caps and Exemptions Currently, there is an annual cap of 65,000 visas, with an additional 20,000 for individuals holding advanced degrees from US universities. However, not all petitions fall under this cap \u2014 exemptions apply for continuing employment, higher education institutions, and nonprofit or government research organisations. As a result, approvals far exceed the cap. In FY 2023, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services approved 118,948 initial employment petitions and 267,370 for continuing employment, totalling 3,86,318. Immigration Politics and Criticism of H-1B Visas in the US Immigration remains one of the most divisive issues in US politics, with concern over it rising sharply in recent years. Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric has often targeted immigration, blaming it for job losses, wage stagnation, inflation, and economic distress faced by the working class. While earlier criticism centred on low-skilled migrants, the H-1B visa program has now come under fire for allegedly displacing American workers from high-paying jobs . This narrative, often intertwined with racial undertones, frames immigration as a threat to American livelihoods and fuels political attacks on skilled migration programs like H-1B. Indians as the Largest Beneficiaries of H-1B Since 2015, Indians have consistently accounted for over 70% of all H-1B visa approvals, far outnumbering Chinese applicants, who remain around 12\u201313%. This dominance has made Indian professionals a focal point of criticism from nativist Republicans, who argue that the program allows Indians to take American jobs at lower wages. Criticism of Wage Disparities Opponents claim that US tech companies misuse the H-1B program to fill low-to-mid-level positions at salaries below what Americans would demand . Supporting this narrative, data show that nearly 70% of Indian H-1B approvals in FY 2023 were for salaries under $100,000, compared to the US median IT salary of $104,420. Only 5% were for salaries above $150,000. Defence of the Program Despite criticism, industry leaders emphasize that H-1B visas remain essential for addressing the US skills gap. They argue that wages are market-driven, and global competition for STEM talent is fierce. With China (3.57 million) and India (2.55 million) producing far more STEM graduates than the US (820,000), Indian and Chinese professionals continue to dominate the high-skilled workforce. Trump\u2019s Proposed Overhaul of H-1B Although details remain unclear, Trump and his allies have hinted at a major restructuring of the H-1B visa system. A 2021 rule proposed under his administration offers insights into the possible direction of reforms. Salary-Based Selection Rule The 2021 proposal sought to prioritize H-1B petitions based on salary levels under the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES). Higher-paid applicants (Level 3 and 4) would be favored over lower-paid ones (Level 1 and 2). If implemented, such a change would heavily disadvantage early-career professionals , particularly international students who typically begin at Level 1 or 2 wage bands. This aligns with Trump\u2019s narrative of prioritizing \u201chigher-value\u201d workers while curbing low-wage immigration. The \u201cGolden Card\u201d Project In parallel, Trump has floated the idea of a \u201cGolden Card,\u201d offering residency and citizenship to wealthy investors contributing $1 million to businesses or $800,000 to rural or distressed areas. The initiative has reportedly attracted 250,000 applicants, potentially", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

India\u2019s Police Must Get Out of Dirty Harry\u2019s Shadow July 31, 2025 Context In the dim light of a crime scene, two archetypes of policing emerge, Sherlock Holmes and Dirty Harry and Holmes is the emblem of reason: calm, methodical, and devoted to logic. He sifts through chaos with precision, guided by evidence and a belief that truth must be discovered, not forced. Dirty Harry, on the other hand, represents the opposite: brash, violent , and dismissive of rules; Justice, for him, is delivered swiftly, regardless of procedure or accuracy. These fictional figures reflect two very real and divergent models of policing in India. In a nation governed by law, the pressing question is not just how we catch criminals, but what kind of justice we are willing to accept, one driven by truth or one fuelled by vengeance. The Cost of Impunity: A National Crisis The death of 27-year-old Ajith Kumar in police custody in Tamil Nadu is not an aberration but a symptom of a deeper malaise. Despite previous reform recommendations , including those from the Tamil Nadu Police Commission, torture and custodial violence remain rampant. Between 2018 and 2023, 687 people died in police custody across Indian, average of two to three deaths per week. States like Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu top this grim list. These figures are likely understatements. Many deaths are cloaked under vague labels like suicide or natural causes. Torture often occurs away from formal detention spaces , in police vans, remote buildings, or even cow sheds, as in Ajith\u2019s case. Most victims come from India's most marginalised communities : daily-wage labourers, Dalits, tribals, migrants, and slum dwellers. Thus, custodial torture is not merely an issue of poor policing, it is an expression of structural violence rooted in caste, class, and power disparities. The Legal and Moral Vacuum Despite multiple legal safeguards, from the Supreme Court\u2019s D.K. Basu (1996) guidelines to the reaffirmation of bodily autonomy in K.S. Puttaswamy (2017), custodial violence remains entrenched. The 273rd Report of the Law Commission (2017) strongly recommended a dedicated anti-torture law, but Parliament has failed to act. India still has not ratified the United Nations Convention Against Torture. In 2025, the Global Torture Index ranked India as a high-risk country , an indictment that must not be ignored. The Scientific and Strategic Case Against Torture The argument against custodial torture extends beyond ethics and legality, it is grounded in science. Torture , popularised in media as a tool for urgent truth extraction, is in fact counterproductive. In his book Why Torture Doesn\u2019t Work, neuroscientist Shane O\u2019Mara explains how torture disrupts brain regions essential for memory and reasoning. Victims, impaired and desperate, often provide false information just to stop the pain. Historical examples reinforce this. During the Algerian War, torture by French forces led to false intelligence. The CIA\u2019s infamous enhanced interrogation techniques failed to produce actionable insights , as concluded by the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s 2014 report. Worse still, these methods misdirected investigations and wasted precious time. The case of Ajith Kumar, where a coerced confession led to a cow shed instead of evidence, tragically echoes this pattern. What Actually Works: The Case for Reform The United Kingdom\u2019s response to the wrongful conviction of six men in the Birmingham pub bombings was to move away from confession-based policing . It adopted the PEACE model, Preparation and Planning, Engage and Explain, Account, Closure, and Evaluation. This method prioritises rapport, open-ended questioning, and transparency , reducing false confessions and increasing both conviction accuracy and public trust. This model has been successfully adopted by other nations , including Norway, Canada, and New Zealand. The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture endorses it, and peer-reviewed studies by the U.S. High-Value Detainee Interrogation Group confirm its effectiveness over coercive methods. Real-world examples further affirm this . Norwegian police obtained a full confession from mass murderer Anders Breivik through calm, professional questioning. In the U.S., Najibullah Zazi, involved in a terror plot, cooperated fully with investigators who treated him respectfully, leading to the dismantling of a broader network . Conclusion Every custodial death is not just a tragedy ; it is a declaration of the state\u2019s failure to protect its citizens. India must act decisively. Ratifying the UN Convention Against Torture , enacting a standalone anti-torture law, embedding the PEACE model into police training, and enforcing zero tolerance for custodial abuse are immediate, achievable reforms. When truth can be found without violence, when the facts can emerge through patience and intellect, as Sherlock Holmes shows us, why should we en", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}
{"id": "f6de091f-1c24-4dcf-a84d-a19dfb031cc8", "text": "Home / Mains Articles / Judicial Discretion Ke... Judicial Discretion Key in POCSO Bail Decisions July 31, 2025 Why in news? A special POCSO court in Mumbai recently granted bail to a 40-year-old teacher accused of sexually assaulting a minor, citing consensual relations. The order has renewed focus on the complexities of bail under the POCSO Act, which is stricter than standard criminal law. Unlike regular cases where the prosecution must prove guilt, in POCSO cases the burden shifts to the accused to prove innocence. This reversal makes securing bail\u2014especially in the early stages of investigation\u2014particularly difficult. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? POCSO Act Judicial Discretion and Bail in POCSO Cases Consent and Legal Grey Zones Under POCSO POCSO Act The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 is a special law enacted to safeguard children (individuals below 18 years of age) from sexual offences. It provides a comprehensive legal framework to address sexual abuse, harassment, and exploitation of minors. Key features of the Act Gender-neutral protection : Applies to both boys and girls. Wide range of offences : Covers penetrative and non-penetrative assault, sexual harassment, and pornography involving children. Special courts : Mandates the establishment of child-friendly Special Courts for speedy trial. Mandatory reporting : Any person who has knowledge of child sexual abuse is legally required to report it. Presumption of guilt : The accused must prove innocence, reversing the general legal principle of \u201cinnocent until proven guilty.\u201d Confidentiality : Protects the identity of the child during investigation and trial to avoid further trauma. Support for Victims : It provides a framework for supporting and rehabilitating victims of sexual offenses. Child-Friendly Procedures : The act emphasizes child-friendly procedures for recording statements, medical examinations, and court appearances. Judicial Discretion and Bail in POCSO Cases Offences under the POCSO Act are cognizable and non-bailable , meaning arrests can occur without a warrant and bail is not guaranteed . However, the Act does not lay down specific bail criteria. Courts rely on Section 483 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita , 2023 (formerly Section 439 CrPC), which considers factors like the gravity of the offence, potential punishment, flight risk, and risk of evidence tampering. Over time, courts have introduced additional considerations. In Dharmander Singh (2020) , the Delhi High Court listed factors like the ages of the victim and accused, their age gap, relationship dynamics, coercion, and post-offence conduct\u2014though not binding, they serve as a guide. In Deshraj @ Musa vs State of Rajasthan (2024 ), the Supreme Court granted bail to an 18-year-old in a consensual relationship with a 16-year-old, given the minor age gap, time spent in custody, and slow trial progress. These cases underscore that bail in POCSO matters ultimately depends on judicial discretion balancing individual liberty with victim protection. Consent and Legal Grey Zones Under POCSO The POCSO Act does not recognise consent from individuals below the age of 18, treating all sexual activity with minors as an offence , regardless of whether it was voluntary. This creates a legal grey area , particularly in cases involving consensual adolescent relationships that are later criminalised. While courts have started considering such nuances during bail hearings\u2014especially when the alleged victim confirms the consensual nature of the relationship in a magistrate\u2019s statement\u2014bail remains difficult in the early investigation phase. Courts often wait for critical evidence and victim testimony before granting relief, leading to prolonged custody for the accused. Due to this, Senior Advocate Indira Jaising has urged the Supreme Court to lower the age of consent to 16, citing infringement of adolescent rights. However, the Centre opposed this, warning that reducing the age could weaken protections for minors and potentially increase vulnerability to abuse.

GLOF (Introduction, Risk in Himalayas, Catastrophic Events, Growing Vulnerability, National Strategy, Innovations, Preparedness, Future Outlook) Introduction Recently, in July 2025, a severe Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) struck Nepal, sweeping away a China-built friendship bridge and rendering multiple hydropower plants inoperative. This catastrophe underscored the growing threat posed by glacial melt in the Himalayas, a region already vulnerable due to global warming and seismic activity. For India, which houses over 7,500 glacial lakes across 11 river basins, GLOF events pose a serious risk to infrastructure, livelihoods, and ecosystems. The Indian government, through the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) , has initiated a multi-pronged strategy focused on early warning, risk mitigation, and community engagement to tackle this emerging challenge. Rising GLOF Risk in the Himalayas GLOFs occur when unstable glacial lakes, formed due to melting glaciers, suddenly burst, releasing massive volumes of water downstream. In the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR), two major types of glacial lakes are found: Supraglacial Lakes : Formed on the glacier surface, vulnerable to summer melting. Moraine-Dammed Lakes : Formed at the glacier toe and dammed by loose debris, highly prone to collapse due to avalanches or ice-core instability. According to the National Remote Sensing Centre , India is home to around 28,000 glacial lakes , with most situated above 4,500 metres, making ground access difficult and monitoring sparse. Catastrophic Events and Growing Vulnerability India has already experienced several GLOF disasters, such as: Chorabari GLOF (2013) : Triggered the Kedarnath tragedy with cascading floods and landslides, killing hundreds. South Lhonak GLOF (2023, Sikkim) : Destroyed the 1,250 MW Chungthang dam, raising the Teesta riverbed and decreasing its water-carrying capacity. The risk is compounded by rising temperatures. 2023 and 2024 were the hottest years globally , leading to increased glacier melt and destabilisation of lake structures. Additionally, the lack of weather and water monitoring stations in high-altitude areas has left most glacial lakes unmapped and unguarded . National Strategy for GLOF Mitigation Recognising the scale of the threat, the NDMA launched a $20 million national programme , identifying 195 high-risk lakes , classified into four levels of vulnerability. The initiative, under the Committee on Disaster Risk Reduction (CoDRR) , focuses on five core objectives: Hazard Assessment of each lake Installation of Automated Weather and Water Stations (AWWS) Deployment of Early Warning Systems (EWS) Water drawdown or retention structures at critical lakes Community engagement and education to improve response readiness States housing glacial lakes were encouraged to lead the effort by sending scientific expeditions to 40 of the most vulnerable lakes during the summer of 2024. Scientific Techniques and Innovations To bridge India's existing data and monitoring gaps, several advanced tools and technologies have been deployed: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Interferometry : Used for micro-level monitoring of slope stability and lake expansion, accurate up to a centimetre. Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) : Helps detect subsurface ice cores that could lead to dam failure. Bathymetry and UAV Surveys : Assess lake volume and surrounding terrain. Notably, two lakes in Sikkim are now equipped with AWWS units, transmitting water level and weather data every 10 minutes along with daily images of lake perimeters, establishing India\u2019s first operational monitoring stations in the cryosphere. Institutional and Community Preparedness Apart from technical tools, India has turned to ground-level institutions like the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) for manual early warnings. Given their high-altitude deployments, ITBP personnel are now being trained to detect visible signs of GLOF risk. Community engagement has also emerged as a critical element. Several scientific teams were welcomed or rejected based on their rapport with local residents. The importance of culturally sensitive engagement became apparent when an expedition team had to leave behind a member to honour the sanctity of a lake considered sacred by locals. Future Outlook and Scaling Efforts The government intends to scale the national programme under the upcoming 16 th Finance Commission (FY2027\u201331) . The plan includes expanding risk surveillance across thousands of lakes, scaling up scientific monitoring, and building institutional capacities for coordinated response.

Adopt Formalisation to Power Productivity Growth July 30, 2025 Context In recent decades, India\u2019s formal manufacturing sector has experienced a profound shift in its employment structure , marked by a significant rise in contract labour. Data from the Annual Surveys of Industries (ASI) shows that the share of contract labour in manufacturing employment doubled from 20% in 1999-2000 to 40.7% in 2022-23, cutting across various industries. This growing trend towards informalisation within the formal sector has raised considerable concerns regarding its implications for worker welfare and productivity growth. Plight of Contract Workers Employment Outside Core Labour Protections The rise of contract labour is often rationalised as a means to enhance operational flexibility by allowing firms to access specialised skills and adjust labour force size according to market needs. However, evidence suggests that cost avoidance, rather than true labour flexibility or skill acquisition, is the predominant driver behind this trend. Contract workers are usually hired through third-party contractors and remain outside core labour protections under the Industrial Disputes Act 1947. Their exclusion from laws governing layoffs, retrenchments, and protection from arbitrary dismissals severely weakens their bargaining power , leaving them vulnerable to exploitation. Wage Disparities This exploitation is reflected in wage disparities: in 2018-19, contract workers earned 14.47% less than regular workers on average. Large enterprises exhibited the greatest wage gaps at 31% , followed by medium (23%) and small enterprises (12%). Employer cost savings are even more striking , the average daily labour cost for contract workers was 24% lower than for regular workers. In certain industries, the labour cost for contract workers was less than 50% that of regular staff, with gaps as high as 78-85% indicating deep exploitation levels. Impact of Contract Labour on Productivity Workforce Stability Contract labour can contribute beneficially by bringing job-specific expertise and offering firms a buffer to rapidly respond to market fluctuations. Nevertheless, when contractualization is mediated through third-party agencies on short-term contracts, it can create principal-agent problems. Contracting firms may misalign incentives with subcontractors, increasing risks of shirking and reducing workforce stability. Overall Low Productivity High labour turnover and insecurity discourage investment in on-the-job training and innovation, crucial factors for sustained productivity growth. The study\u2019s analysis reveals that contract labour-intensive (CLI) enterprises show 31% lower labour productivity compared to regular labour-intensive (RLI) enterprises on average. This disparity is more pronounced in smaller firms with fewer than 100 workers (36%) and medium-sized firms (23%), and is the worst in labour-intensive industries (42%). These gaps persist even after controlling for other firm and regional factors, underscoring the detrimental productivity effects of contractualization primarily driven by cost-cutting and regulation circumvention. However, a small subset of enterprises, approximately 20% of formal manufacturing, demonstrate productivity gains from contractualization. High-skill CLI enterprises enjoy a 5% productivity advantage over their low-skill counterparts, rising to 20% in large high-skill firms. Similarly, large capital-intensive CLI firms show a 17% productivity gain . Despite these exceptions, the overwhelming majority of firms experience adverse outcomes due to excessive reliance on contract labour. Policy Recommendations Timely Implementation of Industrial Relations Code In response to these challenges, the Indian government introduced the Industrial Relations Code in 2020 . The code aims to grant firms greater flexibility through direct fixed-term contracts with non-regular workers, eliminating third-party intermediaries, while ensuring baseline statutory benefits to reduce worker exploitation. However, implementation delays and union apprehensions highlight risks that increased hiring flexibility might accelerate informalisation and degrade job quality further. Incentivise Firms for Long-Terms Contracts To reconcile flexibility with security, policymakers should incentivise firms to adopt longer fixed-term contracts by offering social security contribution discounts or subsidised access to government skilling programmes. This would improve workforce stability, skill formation, and allay labour union concerns about precarious employment proliferation. Resurrecting Initiatives Like the Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana (PMRPY) These initiatives encouraged formal job creation by subsidising employer contributions to pension and provident funds, could significantly curb contract labour misuse and promote formalisation. Despite benefiting over one crore workers, the PMRPY was disc", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

India's Insurance Sector - Projected Boom and Structural Shifts by 2030 July 27, 2025 Why in News? India\u2019s insurance industry is poised for substantial expansion, with Gross Written Premiums (GWP) expected to grow by 123% by 2030. This development reflects changing consumer behavior, increasing insurance awareness, and structural transformations in both retail and institutional segments. The insights are based on a joint report by the Insurance Brokers Association of India ( IBAI ) and McKinsey & Company, supported by the IBAI Insurance Insights Survey of 2,500 retail customers. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Growth Trajectory of India\u2019s Insurance Sector Retail Segment - Divergent Needs and Behaviors Institutional Segment - Emerging Growth Frontiers Policy and Regulatory Implications India\u2019s Insurance Sector Growth Trajectory of India\u2019s Insurance Sector: Rapid increase in GWP: GWP refers to the total amount of premium revenue an insurer collects from policies issued during a specific period, before any deductions for reinsurance or other adjustments. GWP to grow from \u20b911.2 lakh crore in 2024 to \u20b925 lakh crore by 2030. This reflects a 123% increase in total insurance premium volume. Rising insurance penetration: Insurance penetration (ratio of total insurance premiums collected by insurance companies to a country's GDP) to improve from 3.7% (2024) to 5% by 2030 , closing the gap with the global average of 6.8% (2023). Past performance: Between FY 2020 and FY 2024, total premiums rose from \u20b97.8 lakh crore to \u20b911.2 lakh crore, showing strong double-digit growth. Retail Segment - Divergent Needs and Behaviors: Dominance of life insurance: Retail GWP is expected to reach \u20b921 lakh crore by 2030, with over 90% from life insurance. Customer pyramid insights: 65% of opportunity lies at the two ends - UHNI and HNI (Ultra/High Net-Worth Individuals) with assets over \u20b98.5 crore. Mass-market customers (individuals or businesses with relatively similar needs and purchasing power) with basic or first-time insurance needs. Insurance awareness vs. actual coverage: 60% of HNI/UHNI customers believe ideal cover is 10 times of their salary, but only 30% actually hold such coverage. Intent-coverage gap (a period during which an individual lacks insurance coverage) is a major structural issue. Influence on purchase decisions: 70% HNI/UHNI : Rely on trusted advisors. 45% mass-market : Influenced by family and friends. Claims experience: 50% of HNI+ customers considered switching insurers due to poor claims service. 55% SMEs faced claim rejections. 75% need help with claims paperwork. Institutional Segment - Emerging Growth Frontiers: Non-life insurance dominance: Institutional GWP to grow 3 times to \u20b92.8 lakh crore by 2030. SME segment potential: Currently contributes approximately 10%, but expected to grow fastest. Half of SME opportunities concentrated in 17 cities and 10 capital-intensive industries: textiles, automotives, pharmaceuticals, industrial goods , etc. Structural barriers: Low intent to purchase due to - Perceived non-necessity. Lack of risk-management knowledge. Margin pressures. Role of regulatory push: 70% SMEs purchase insurance due to compliance, not voluntary need. Seek advisory support, sector-specific products, and handholding in claims. Policy and Regulatory Implications: Bridging the insurance gap can support financial resilience and economic stability. The sector offers scope for regulatory reforms , digital outreach, and inclusive insurance models. Focus needed on - Customer-centric innovations. Simplified claims management. Insurance literacy , especially among SMEs and low-income segments. India\u2019s Insurance Sector: Insurance in India (covers both public and private sector organisations) is listed in the Seventh Schedule of India's Constitution as a Union List subject , meaning it can only be legislated by the Central government. The primary regulator for insurance in India is the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India ( IRDAI ) which is a statutory body established in 1999. India is the fifth largest life insurance market in the world's emerging insurance markets, growing at a rate of 32-34% each year. Over the past nine years, the insurance sector has attracted substantial foreign direct investment amounting to nearly Rs. 54,000 crore (US$ 6.5 billion), driven by the government's progressive relaxation of overseas capital flow regulations. FDI sectoral cap in the insurance sector has been revised from 49% to 74% under the automatic route. The Union Budget 2025 also announced the further increase of FDI sectoral cap for the insurance sector from 74% to 100%. This enhanced limit will be available for those companies, which invest the entire premium in India. The insurance industry of India has 57 i nsurance companies - 24 are in the life insurance business, while 34 are non-life insurers.

The Yarlung Tsangpo Project - Strategic, Ecological, and Geopolitical Implications for India July 29, 2025 Context: Recently, Chinese Premier Li Qiang launched construction of a massive hydropower project on the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet , close to the Indian border . The Yarlung Tsangpo project's scale, lack of transparency, ecological threats, and strategic ramifications have raised serious concerns for India , especially as no prior consultation was conducted with lower riparian states like India and Bangladesh. Project Overview and Strategic Location: Project cost and scale: Estimated at 1.2 trillion yuan (US$167.8 billion), it involves five cascade hydropower plants in Medog County, approximately 30 km from India's Arunachal Pradesh border. Expected annual generation will be 300 billion kWh, more than thrice the designed capacity (88.2 billion kWh) of the Three Gorges Dam in China, currently the largest in the world. Engineering features: It would involve drilling 4-6 tunnels of 20 km each, diverting up to 50% of the river\u2019s flow. It is located in a high seismic zone (Zone V) \u2013 Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis. Environmental and Hydrological Concerns: Disruption of Brahmaputra flow: The project would alter natural hydrology and seasonal flow, especially in the lean season. It will impact aquatic biodiversity , fisheries, sediment load, and ecosystem services. The construction of five massive hydropower plants in cascade is likely to involve reservoir-like structures , even though it is claimed to be a run-of-the-river project. Flood risk: Sudden or unannounced water release during heavy rainfall or earthquakes could lead to catastrophic downstream flooding. Seismic vulnerability: Project area prone to earthquakes due to Himalayan Frontal Thrust and Medog Fault. Past Chinese engineering failures (e.g., Neelum-Jhelum in PoK) raise safety concerns. Diplomatic and Legal Dimensions: Lack of riparian cooperation: China has consistently withheld data and transparency . Past behavior on the Mekong River affected Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, setting a worrying precedent. No operationalization of three MoUs signed with India in 2013. International water laws: Neither India nor China are signatories to the UN Convention (1997) on international watercourses. However, principles like \u201c equitable utilization \u201d and \u201c no significant harm \u201d are part of customary international law. Geopolitical double standards: China likely would not tolerate similar behavior from upstream states. India\u2019s quiet diplomacy is seen as ineffective; stronger public and diplomatic messaging is needed. Strategic and Policy Recommendations for India: Diplomatic pushback: Demand full project disclosure , seismic safety reports, and environmental impact assessments. Seek project suspension until legitimate Indian concerns are addressed. Domestic response: Build flood moderation infrastructure in Arunachal and Assam. Use remote sensing and geospatial tools for independent hydrological assessments. Reduce dependence on China for hydrological data. Internationalizing the issue: Promote NGO engagement and international discourse. Elevate the issue in bilateral talks and in multilateral platforms to signal assertiveness. Conclusion: The Yarlung Tsangpo project is not just an ecological and hydrological threat but a strategic challenge. India must shift from passive diplomacy to proactive engagement, emphasizing transboundary water governance, sovereign rights, and ecological security. The time has come for India to build pressure through diplomatic, technical, and international legal instruments while enhancing domestic preparedness.

China has officially started building a massive $167.8 billion hydropower dam on the Brahmaputra River, near the Indian border in Arunachal Pradesh. The groundbreaking ceremony was attended by Premier Li Qiang. Once completed, this will be the world\u2019s largest dam. The project has raised concerns in India and Bangladesh over its potential impact on the river\u2019s natural flow and downstream water availability. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Arunachal Raises Alarm Over China\u2019s Brahmaputra Dam Project China\u2019s Brahmaputra Dam: The View From Assam India\u2019s Cautious Response to China\u2019s Brahmaputra Dam Project India\u2019s Mitigation Strategy Amid China\u2019s Brahmaputra Dam Concerns Arunachal Raises Alarm Over China\u2019s Brahmaputra Dam Project China\u2019s construction of a massive 60,000 MW hydropower dam on the Yarlung Zangbo (Brahmaputra) near the \u201cGreat Bend\u201d in Tibet , just before the river enters Arunachal Pradesh as the Siang, has sparked serious concerns in India. Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister has called it an \u201cexistential threat\u201d and likened the project to a potential \u201cwater bomb\u201d that could devastate tribal communities and local livelihoods. He warned that sudden water release could flood the entire Siang region and drastically reduce river flow in the long term. Experts echo these fears, citing risks of flooding from dam operations, as well as the danger posed by the seismically active and ecologically fragile zone where the dam is being built . The project raises broader environmental and geopolitical anxieties for downstream countries like India and Bangladesh. China\u2019s Brahmaputra Dam: The View From Assam Assam Chief Minister has downplayed immediate concerns about China's dam on the Brahmaputra, highlighting that the river becomes a major waterway only after entering Assam , where it is nourished by tributaries from Bhutan, Arunachal Pradesh, and heavy monsoon rains. He noted that China's contribution to the Brahmaputra\u2019s flow is limited\u2014about 30\u201335%\u2014mostly from glacial melt and Tibetan rainfall. He suggested that even if China were to reduce water flow, it might help manage Assam\u2019s annual floods. Still, he acknowledged the existence of multiple theories about the dam\u2019s impact and expressed confidence that the central government is either already engaged in talks with China or will initiate discussions soon. India\u2019s Cautious Response to China\u2019s Brahmaputra Dam Project India has not issued an official response to the recent groundbreaking ceremony of China\u2019s massive dam on the Brahmaputra River, but continues to closely monitor the developments. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has reiterated India\u2019s concerns as a lower riparian state with established rights, emphasizing the need for transparency and consultation with downstream countries like India and Bangladesh. MEA had underscored India\u2019s position in January, urging China to avoid actions that could harm downstream interests. In contrast, China has maintained that the project falls within its sovereign rights and assured ongoing cooperation with downstream nations on hydrological data and disaster management. Diplomatic Efforts on Multiple Fronts Diplomatic efforts between India and China have continued on multiple fronts. In October 2024, both nations had agreed on patrolling arrangements along the LAC to resolve past tensions. Additionally, talks in March 2025 included discussions on cross-border cooperation, including river management. India also resumed issuing tourist visas to Chinese nationals recently and restarted the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra, signaling a cautious yet active engagement despite the concerns surrounding the dam project. India\u2019s Mitigation Strategy Amid China\u2019s Brahmaputra Dam Concerns Experts recommend scientific assessment and capacity-building to anticipate any deliberate Chinese actions. They have proposed constructing storage infrastructure on Brahmaputra tributaries to manage erratic flows. The Upper Siang project in Arunachal Pradesh, with a 300-metre-high dam, is considered crucial both for hydropower and as a buffer against sudden water releases, although local opposition over environmental concerns has delayed progress. Additional strategies include developing inland channels for excess water diversion and pursuing long-term interlinking projects between the Brahmaputra and Ganga basins, as proposed by the National Water Development Authority. On the diplomatic front, experts advocate for continuous access to hydrological and project data from China, while also urging coordination with downstream neighbours like Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Myanmar to establish protocols for early warning and disaster preparedness.

Why Antitrust Regulations Are Pertinent July 29, 2025 Context In 1890, Senator John Sherman famously declared, \u2018 If we will not endure a king as a political power, we should not endure a king over the production, transportation, and sale of any of the necessaries of life.\u2019 With these words, the Sherman Antitrust Act was born , laying the foundation for modern competition law in the United States and inspiring similar legislative frameworks across the globe, including in India. Although the nature of what constitutes a necessity of life has evolved, Sherman's warning against monopolistic dominance remains chillingly relevant in the 21st-century digital economy. India, with its booming tech landscape and ambitious economic goals, now finds itself grappling with monopolistic practices by global digital giants, especially in how they shape access, discovery, and monetization for domestic start-ups. The Digital Economy and India\u2019s Ambitions India's digital economy contributed 11.74% to the nation's GDP in 2022\u201323 , marking it as a central pillar of national development. The explosion of start-ups, from 2,000 in 2014 to over 31,000 in 2023 , signals a thriving entrepreneurial spirit. The government envisions these start-ups as engines of growth for its ambitious $35 trillion \u2018Viksit Bharat\u2019 vision by 2047. However, while technological infrastructure enables innovation, the pathways of digital commerce and discovery are often dominated by foreign tech giants , resulting in distorted market dynamics that can stifle homegrown potential. Gatekeeping and Market Power in the Digital Age One of the most glaring manifestations of this gatekeeping is Google\u2019s overwhelming dominance in the digital distribution ecosystem. With Android capturing around 95% of India\u2019s mobile OS market, Google essentially controls how Indian consumers discover and interact with digital products. Indian start-ups are therefore compelled to operate within Google\u2019s ecosystem , paying high commissions on in-app transactions and competing under discriminatory terms that tilt the market in favour of select players. A recent complaint to the Competition Commission of India (CCI) by a major Indian gaming start-up underscores this imbalance. The complaint centres on Google's Real Money Gaming (RMG) Pilot Program, which selectively allowed only two gaming formats, Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) and rummy, on its Play Store, effectively excluding other legitimate gaming formats. This discriminatory policy granted unfair advantages to a handful of operators, with one DFS company reportedly acquiring 55 million users in just one year through the program. Meanwhile, advertising policy changes cut off vital promotional avenues for other gaming businesses, despite their prior reliance on Google\u2019s ad network for over two-thirds of app downloads. Antitrust and the Broader Economic Impact Such market distortions have far-reaching economic implications. When dominant players favour select partners, it reduces competition, which in turn limits innovation, consumer choice, and product quality. Over-reliance on a few digital gatekeepers weakens the resilience of the digital ecosystem and jeopardizes long-term economic goals. This is particularly dangerous for a developing economy like India , which depends heavily on inclusive growth driven by new ideas and start-ups. The United States offers a cautionary tale: the unchecked rise of monopolies has led to a significant decline in Initial Public Offerings and increased entry barriers for new businesses. If similar monopolistic trends continue unchecked in India, the cost will be borne not just by start-ups , but also by consumers and the economy at large. The Way Forward: Towards a Fairer Digital Market It is clear that global tech giants like Google play a foundational role in the digital ecosystem. However, their responsibilities must match their power. The Indian government and institutions like the CCI must work to ensure that the digital economy is a level playing field, where innovation is not stifled by exclusionary practices or market manipulation. The case filed by the Indian gaming company is more than a corporate dispute , it is emblematic of a broader push for fair competition and market access. It echoes Sherman\u2019s call to resist economic kingship and promotes a digital future where distribution and monetization are democratized, not monopolised. Conclusion Senator Sherman\u2019s 19th-century concerns find startling resonance in 21st-century India. As the country charges ahead in its digital revolution, it must remain vigilant against monopolistic forces that can derail its aspirations. With the right regulatory interventions, India can ensure that its start-up ecosystem remains dynamic, competitive, and fair, delivering on the promise of Viksit Bharat and carrying forward Sherman\u2019s legacy into the digital age.

Bihar\u2019s Dark Side \u2014 The Hub of Girl Child Trafficking July 30, 2025 Context The harrowing journey of a 14-year-old girl , trafficked from Chhattisgarh to Bihar under false promises of a better future, is not just a singular tragedy. It stands as a grim testament to a widespread and deeply rooted crisis. Her story, marked by unimaginable violence and loss of dignity, mirrors the experience of countless girls across India, particularly in Bihar , where human trafficking has evolved into a sophisticated and brutal industry. The Stark Reality: Statistics and Suffering Until June this year alone, 271 girls were rescued from trafficking in Bihar, more than half having been forced into exploitative orchestra work, the rest into the flesh trade. Saran district, notorious for such operations, saw the rescue of 162 girls since January, while partner organisations like Just Rights for Children aided in saving 116 more between March and June. Behind these numbers lie horrors: girls as young as 12 sold for as little as \u20b910,000, forced into sexual slavery, and subjected to violence in squalid, overcrowded quarters. Why Bihar? The Roots of Vulnerability Pervasive Poverty: Years of deprivation drive families to take perilous risks. Geographical Factors: Porous borders with Nepal and railway links to trafficking-prone states (West Bengal, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and others) ease the movement of traffickers and their victims. Cultural Manipulation: In arts-focused states, aspirations for a better life or artistic stardom are cynically manipulated by traffickers. Systemic Failures: Where Protection Breaks Down Low Conviction Rates: Most cases are misfiled as kidnappings; prosecutions lag, and convictions remain rare. Under-Resourced Agencies: Anti-Human Trafficking Units (AHTUs) lack manpower and expertise , and jurisdictional disputes thwart cross-state investigations. Inadequate Rehabilitation: Rescued girls often return to the same conditions, and families , that enabled their exploitation in the first place. The Orchestra Belt: A Facade of Performance In Bihar\u2019s orchestra belt, districts like Saran, Gopalganj, Muzaffarpur, Rohtas , and West Champaran, the supposed dance troupes and orchestras are often fronts for trafficking rings. Girls are forced into dehumanising performances before drunken crowds, punished or raped for resistance, and stripped of any possibility for escape. The Way Forward Legal and Institutional Responses Encouragingly, there are signs of institutional recognition and action. Following advocacy by groups such as Just Rights for Children, the Patna High Court directed the state government to urgently address the trafficking and exploitation of girls in orchestras. However, such acknowledgments require transformation into concrete actions: Strict Enforcement: Immediate prohibition and mapping of minors in orchestras, prosecution of perpetrators, and the sealing of exploitative premises. Comprehensive Oversight: Institutions, from law enforcement to local panchayats, must be involved in not just rescue but in monitoring, prosecution, and long-term rehabilitation. Prevention at the Core School and Community Vigilance: Monitoring attendance and reporting prolonged absences must become routine. Migratory registers in villages should trigger action when children disappear. Transport Surveillance: Authorities like the Railway Protection Force must extend vigilance to all transport networks and train staff to recognize trafficking signs. Strengthening AHTUs: Specialized, full-time officers with clear mandates and cross-border authority are critical for tracking and prosecuting traffickers. Victim-Centric Rehabilitation: State-supervised, long-term support and victim compensation must be non-negotiable. Prosecution as Prevention A recent report by the Centre for Legal Action and Behaviour Change ( C-Lab ) reinforces the pivotal role of prosecution. Data from 24 states demonstrate that when every case is pursued and legal action taken , justice is not only delivered, but child labour and trafficking are also effectively deterred. The PICKET Strategy: A Blueprint for Zero Tolerance Policy: Clear, enforced policies prohibiting child labour and exploitation. Institutions: Strong, accountable monitoring, prosecution, and rehabilitation systems. Convergence: Collaboration among agencies, digital databases, and survivor-led intelligence. Knowledge: Community awareness and the strategic use of survivor insights. Economic Disincentives: Making trafficking financially riskier than any perceived benefit. Technology: Databases, predictive analytics, and heat mapping to pre-empt trafficking routes. Conclusion India possesses the laws , the institutions, and the knowledge to end child trafficking and exploitation. What is desperately needed now is the political will and public resolve to transform systemic acknowledgment into systemic action.

Boost the Capacity of Legal Aid Systems July 31, 2025 Context Access to justice is a constitutional promise in India, yet the gap between principle and practice remains stark. The Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, mandates free legal aid for approximately 80% of India's population. Despite this expansive objective, the actual outreach of legal aid services remains significantly limited. The analysis of recent trends, particularly between April 2023 and March 2024, exposes both structural strengths and glaring systemic weaknesses that continue to hinder equitable access to justice. Concerns Surrounding Free Legal Aid Modest Reach Amidst Expansive Mandate In 2023\u201324, only 15.5 lakh people availed legal aid services , an increase of 28% from the previous year\u2019s 12.14 lakh. Although this rise appears promising, it pales in comparison to the sheer scale of India's eligible population. Legal aid services are typically offered through front offices in local courts , prisons, and juvenile justice boards, supported by empanelled lawyers. In rural areas, legal aid clinics serve as important access points. Yet, the India Justice Report 2025 highlights that there is merely one legal service clinic for every 163 villages, underscoring the skewed distribution and limited penetration of services, especially in remote regions. The situation is aggravated by inconsistent financial and human resource support. Budgetary Constraints and Skewed Prioritisation Legal aid services receive less than 1% of the total justice budget, which includes police, prisons, judiciary, and legal aid combined. Funding is provided both by State governments and the Centre through the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA). While the cumulative allocation rose from \u20b9601 crore in 2017\u201318 to \u20b91,086 crore in 2022\u201323, primarily due to an increase in State contributions, NALSA\u2019s share declined from \u20b9207 crore to \u20b9169 crore. Even more concerning is the declining utilisation rate of NALSA funds , which dropped from 75% to 59% over the same period. Inadequate Per Capita Spending Per capita expenditure on legal aid has increased from \u20b93 to \u20b97 since 2019 , but remains far from adequate. States like Haryana lead with \u20b916 per capita spending , while populous and vulnerable states like Bihar (\u20b93), West Bengal (\u20b92), and Uttar Pradesh (\u20b94) fall below the national average of \u20b96. This unevenness not only highlights disparities in fiscal commitment but also signals an inequitable access to quality legal services across regions. Decline of the Frontline: Para-Legal Volunteers One of the most alarming trends is the reduction in para-legal volunteers (PLVs ), trained individuals who act as community-level intermediaries and educators. Between 2019 and 2024 , their numbers dropped by 38%, with deployment plummeting from 22,000 in 2019\u201320 to just 14,000 in 2023\u201324. Despite their pivotal role, PLVs are poorly compensated; in most states, their daily honorarium remains below minimum wage levels. Kerala is an exception, offering \u20b9750 per day, while states like Gujarat and Mizoram pay only \u20b9250\u2014barely enough to cover daily sustenance. This fiscal neglect severely undermines the sustainability and motivation of this critical workforce. Innovations and Missed Opportunities: The LADC Scheme Since 2022, NALSA has attempted to address quality concerns in legal representation through the Legal Aid Defence Counsel (LADC) scheme, modelled after public defender systems. With \u20b9200 crore fully utilised in 2023\u201324 and the scheme operational in 610 out of 670 districts, early indications suggest promise. However, its budget has already been slashed to \u20b9147.9 crore for 2024\u201325. While still in its infancy, the LADC could alleviate the burden on empanelled lawyers and improve legal aid delivery, but only if sustained through robust policy and financial support. Structural Deficiencies and the Way Forward Despite incremental financial improvements and administrative innovations, legal aid in India suffers from enduring deficiencies, uneven quality, low public trust, and insufficient accountability. These challenges are compounded by chronic underfunding and misallocation of existing resources. The over-regulation of fund utilisation hampers local initiative , while poor compensation and declining deployment of key personnel like PLVs compromise outreach and impact. If legal aid services are to fulfil their constitutional mandate, a radical recalibration is necessary which requires: Increasing budgetary allocation and ensuring it is commensurate with the scale of need. Flexible and needs-based fund utilisation , allowing local units to address contextual challenges. Fair compensation and wider deployment of para-legal volunteers. Sustained investment in promising schemes like the LADC with mechanisms for quality assurance and impact evaluation. Greater integration with community justice mechanisms to develop trust and awareness.

Fiscal Health of Indian States in FY2025 - Trends, Concerns, and Outlook July 30, 2025 Context: Understanding the fiscal position of states is essential for gauging India\u2019s overall macroeconomic health. Therefore, analysing provisional actuals (PA) for FY2025 of 17 major Indian states (covering approximately 90% of India\u2019s GDP) and highlighting trends in fiscal deficit, revenue deficit, and capital expenditure, offers insights into the evolving fiscal dynamics and implications for FY2026 and beyond. Fiscal Trends in FY2025 (Provisional Actuals): Widening fiscal deficit: Fiscal deficit is the excess of total expenditure of the Government over its non- debt receipts (revenue receipts, miscellaneous capital receipts and recovery of loans and advances). It normally represents the net incremental liabilities of the Government or its additional borrowings. FY2025 fiscal deficit of 17 states rose to \u20b99.5 trillion (3.2% of GSDP) from \u20b97.8 trillion (2.9% of GSDP) in FY2024. The deterioration was largely driven by an increase in revenue deficit , with a smaller contribution from capital spending. Surge in revenue deficit: Revenue deficit is the excess of revenue expenditure of the Government over its revenue receipts. It leads to increase in borrowings without corresponding capital/asset formation. Revenue deficit nearly doubled to \u20b92.1 trillion (0.7% of GSDP) in FY2025 from \u20b91.1 trillion (0.4% of GSDP) in FY2024. This resulted from - Slower growth in revenue receipts (6.3% in FY2025 vs 7.9% in FY2024). Stable revenue expenditure growth at 9% year-on-year (YoY). Negative implications of rising revenue deficit: In contrast to the Centre\u2019s fiscal compression, states witnessed revenue pressure. Higher share of revenue deficit in total fiscal deficit indicates less room for productive capital expenditure. Capex share in fiscal deficit declined to 78% in FY2025, below the 80\u201390% trend in FY2022\u201324. Capital Expenditure Dynamics: Overall capex performance: Total capital spending - \u20b97.4 trillion in FY2025 PA, \u20b9678 billion higher than the amount spent in FY2024. However, the incremental capex of the states in FY2025 PA was sharply lower than the incremental spending of Rs 910-1,120 billion during FY2022-FY2024. Capex fell short of Revised Estimates by \u20b91.1 trillion. March 2025 capex surge: In March 2025, the states\u2019 capex surged by 42% YoY to Rs 2.2 trillion from Rs 1.5 trillion in March 2024, led by a pick-up in spending by UP, Andhra Pradesh, MP, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. 30% of annual capex was incurred in March alone \u2014indicative of back-loaded spending and corresponding spike in state government securities borrowing. Role of Centre\u2019s Capex Loan Scheme: Capex loan disbursement - \u20b91.5 trillion in FY2025 (up from \u20b91.1 trillion in FY2024). 17 states\u2019 share - estimated at \u20b91.13 trillion (up from \u20b90.8 trillion). Funded over 40% of FY2025's incremental capex for these states. Budgeted Projections for FY2026 and Future Outlook: FY2026 capex targets: For the budget estimates of FY2026, 17 states have indicated capital spending of Rs 9.5 trillion, 29.2% higher on a YoY basis or an incremental spending of Rs 2.1 trillion in FY2026, relative to the FY2025 PA. This seems a little unrealistic given that it is double the average incremental capital expenditure of Rs 1 trillion during FY2022-FY2024. Long-term challenges and reforms: Recommendations of Finance Commission, Pay Commission , and changes in GST compensation cess will significantly impact state finances. Policies incentivising capex over revenue expenditure within the fiscal space are crucial.

A new report by Quess Corp and the Udaiti Foundation reveals that over half of blue- and grey-collar women workers in India are dissatisfied with their low wages, with 80% saving less than \u20b92,000 per month. These inadequate earnings are a key reason why many women leave formal employment, especially when weighed against the high opportunity costs of working. The report highlights a significant gap between the minimum wage and the actual \u201cliving wage\u201d needed to cover essential expenses like health and education. Recognising this, the Labour Ministry is now considering the inclusion of these costs in wage standards to make formal work more viable for women. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Living Wages Low Pay and High Costs Forcing Women Out of Workforce Government Explores Expanding Minimum Wage Definition to Support Women Beyond Wages: Structural Barriers Hindering Women\u2019s Workforce Participation Manufacturing Hubs Boost Women\u2019s Employment Opportunities Living Wages A living wage is the minimum income necessary for a worker to meet their basic needs such as food, housing, clothing, healthcare, education, and some level of financial security. Unlike minimum wages , which are set by law and often do not account for actual living costs, living wages are calculated based on the cost of living in a specific region . Living wages ensure that workers and their families can live with dignity without falling into poverty. Low Pay and High Costs Forcing Women Out of Workforce A recent survey by Quess Corp reveals that blue- and grey-collar women workers earn only 70% of what their male counterparts make. Blue- and grey-collar women workers are women employed in roles traditionally considered manual labor or technical/skilled trades, respectively. Blue-collar work often involves physical labor, while grey-collar jobs require specialized skills and may involve a combination of physical and intellectual tasks. Coupled with high opportunity costs such as unpaid caregiving, long commutes, and migration expenses, many women struggle to remain in formal employment . The study highlights that women in peri-urban manufacturing zones often face lower minimum wages despite higher living costs. Notably, one in five women earn less than \u20b920,000 per month, the typical minimum wage in Tier 1 cities. The data also shows that women earning above \u20b920,000 are 21% less likely to exit the workforce soon, indicating that better pay significantly improves retention. Government Explores Expanding Minimum Wage Definition to Support Women The government is considering broadening the definition of minimum wage to include expenses on health and education\u2014currently excluded from wage calculations . Presently, the minimum wage is based only on nutrition, housing, and clothing. From a women\u2019s perspective, including childcare and healthcare costs would help reduce the opportunity cost of working. Experts acknowledged the challenge of implementing this in a diverse country like India, where conditions vary by state, and stressed the importance of initiating a social dialogue with both employers and employees. While the move is still in early stages, she welcomed the fact that discussions have begun. Beyond Wages: Structural Barriers Hindering Women\u2019s Workforce Participation While implementing living wage standards would benefit all workers, the impact on women could be especially transformative due to their higher opportunity costs . India\u2019s female labour force participation rate (LFPR) remains low at 32%, compared to 77.1% for men, as per the June PLFS data. Economists argue that raising women\u2019s LFPR above 50% is essential for India to reach developed nation status. However, women face multiple challenges beyond wages, including unsafe or unaffordable housing, poor work culture, limited mobility, and regulatory restrictions . Experts noted that 54 existing laws restrict women's employment , such as those banning night shifts. While these are being gradually repealed, they highlighted that responsibility for women\u2019s safety\u2014especially during night shifts\u2014then falls on employers, a burden more easily borne by large firms than small businesses. Addressing these layered barriers is critical to enabling more women to join and remain in the workforce. Manufacturing Hubs Boost Women\u2019s Employment Opportunities States with strong industrial and manufacturing bases, such as Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Maharashtra, are leading in female workforce participation. Modern electronics and auto manufacturing units in these states are increasingly employing women due to their skills in finger dexterity and hand-eye coordination\u2014qualities that are tested and found more often in women. As a result, sectors like electronics and automotive manufacturing are actively seeking female workers.

Clearing the Air on \u2018Citizenship\u2019 in Bihar Poll Roll Revision July 28, 2025 Context The question of who is eligible to vote in India is not merely an administrative concern but a foundational issue that touches the very core of Indian democracy. At the heart of this issue lies the principle that only Indian citizens are entitled to participate in the electoral process. Yet, controversy has emerged over the Election Commission of India\u2019s (ECI) move to conduct a Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar. Critics of the move argue against the verification of citizenship , betraying either a lack of understanding of the Constitution or a willingness to ignore its mandates for political expediency. Citizenship as a Prerequisite for Electoral Participation According to Article 326 of the Indian Constitution, elections to both the House of the People and the Legislative Assemblies of states must be based on adult suffrage. However, this right is explicitly limited to individuals who are citizens of India and are not less than eighteen years of age. Further, they must not be disqualified by any law made by the appropriate legislature. Therefore, the right to vote is inextricably linked with Indian citizenship . This constitutional principle is reiterated in The Representation of the People Act, 1950 , which provides a detailed legal framework for the preparation and maintenance of electoral rolls. The Role of the Election Commission of India The Election Commission , under Article 324 , is constitutionally mandated to supervise and manage the conduct of elections and the preparation of electoral rolls. This includes revising electoral rolls irrespective of whether elections are impending. The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Lakshmi Charan Sen v. A.K.M. Hassan Uzzaman (1985) reaffirms that such revision is a continuous process under the Commission\u2019s purview. Under this framework, the ECI has both the authority and the duty to ensure that only eligible citizens are enrolled as voters. This includes verifying the authenticity of voter claims and deleting names found to be ineligible. Sections 15 to 24 of the 1950 Act codify these processes , with Section 16 specifically disqualifying non-citizens from voter registration. Section 16(2) empowers the deletion of names wrongly included in the electoral rolls, thereby reinforcing the necessity of verifying citizenship. Legal and Constitutional Disqualifications The connection between citizenship and legislative eligibility is not limited to voting alone. One must be a voter to become a legislator. Consequently, non-citizens cannot contest elections for Parliament or State Assemblies. Articles 102 and 191 of the Constitution make this abundantly clear by disqualifying any individual who is not an Indian citizen, or who voluntarily acquires foreign citizenship or allegiance to another country, from legislative membership. To suggest that a non-citizen can vote or hold legislative office would thus directly contradict constitutional provisions and undermine the very fabric of Indian democracy. Criteria for Inclusion in Electoral Roll Overseas Citizens Further clarity is offered by The Citizenship Act, 1955 , particularly through Sections 7A and 7B . While the Act allows for the registration of Overseas Citizens of India (OCIs), Section 7B(2) clearly denies OCIs the right to vote , thus reinforcing the constitutional restriction that only full citizens may be included in electoral rolls. Residency, Lawful Presence, and Electoral Rolls A key criterion for inclusion in the electoral roll is that the person must be ordinarily resident in a constituency. However, as held in Dr. Yogesh Bhardwaj v. State of U.P. (1990), unlawful residence cannot be equated with ordinary residence. Staying in India in violation of immigration laws does not make one eligible to vote or to claim any residency-based entitlement. Aadhaar and Citizenship: No Equivalence Another area of confusion arises from the possession of an Aadhaar card, for, some have mistakenly assumed that Aadhaar serves as proof of citizenship . However, The Aadhaar Act, 2016 , explicitly clarifies in Section 9 that neither an Aadhaar number nor its authentication confers citizenship or domicile status. Section 3 further states that the card is only for residents, not necessarily citizens , making it legally insufficient for voter registration purposes. Conclusion The electoral system\u2019s legitimacy depends on the integrity of its voter base, which, by constitutional and statutory mandate, must be comprised solely of Indian citizens. The ECI , as the custodian of India\u2019s electoral machinery, is duty-bound to ensure this through verification mechanisms and roll revisions. Any lapse in doing so would constitute a serious breach of constitutional responsibility and could potentially allow the dilution of Indian democracy by non-citizen participation.

A student in Balasore, Odisha, died by self-immolation after her sexual harassment complaints against the head of her department were dismissed by the college\u2019s Internal Complaints Committee (ICC). Her family alleges that the ICC lacked proper training and operated in a biased environment that favoured the accused, raising serious concerns about the effectiveness and neutrality of institutional grievance redressal systems. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Legal Framework Behind ICCs: From Vishaka Guidelines to the POSH Act Powers and Responsibilities of the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) Poor Implementation of the POSH Act Legal Framework Behind ICCs: From Vishaka Guidelines to the POSH Act The foundation for Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) was laid by the Supreme Court in 1997 through the Vishaka Guidelines, following the gang-rape of Bhanwari Devi, a social worker in Rajasthan. These guidelines defined sexual harassment at the workplace and mandated the creation of complaint committees to address such cases. Each committee was to be headed by a woman, include at least 50% women members, and involve an external third party to ensure fairness. However, these guidelines remained advisory until the 2012 Nirbhaya case prompted legislative action. This led to the enactment of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 , commonly known as the POSH Act. The Act made it mandatory for all workplaces with more than 10 employees to establish ICCs . It also ensured that women in smaller or informal workplaces could seek redress through Local Committees formed by district authorities. Powers and Responsibilities of the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) The ICC, mandated under the POSH Act, is empowered to address complaints of sexual harassment at the workplace. It must be headed by a senior woman employee as the Presiding Officer, and should include at least two internal members with experience in social work, legal knowledge, or commitment to women's causes. Additionally, one member must be an external expert, typically from an NGO or with knowledge of sexual harassment issues. Half of the ICC members must be women . Process of Filing Complaints Any aggrieved woman can submit a written complaint within three months of the incident. Upon receiving the complaint, the ICC can either initiate an inquiry or help settle the matter, if the complainant requests. The committee enjoys civil court powers under the Code of Civil Procedure , allowing it to summon witnesses, examine evidence, and conduct proceedings accordingly. It must complete the inquiry within 90 days and recommend appropriate action if the complaint is upheld. The employer is also obligated to assist the complainant in filing a criminal case if she chooses to do so. Strict confidentiality is mandated by law\u2014covering the identity of the complainant, accused, witnesses, and details of the proceedings or recommendations\u2014to protect the privacy of all parties involved. Poor Implementation of the POSH Act Even after ten years since the enactment of the POSH Act, the implementation of Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) remains patchy and inadequate across institutions. In December 2024, the Supreme Court expressed concern over the \"serious lapses\" in enforcement, calling the state of affairs \u201cdisquieting\u201d and ordering immediate compliance across both public and private sectors. Activists pointed out that although ICCs exist in some places, they often lack training, maintain no confidentiality, and fail to address workplace power imbalances \u2014rendering them ineffective. They criticised the lack of coordination between ministries\u2014where the Women and Child Development Ministry oversees the Act, but actual employers fall under the Labour and Industries Ministries . This disconnect has resulted in little to no monitoring or analysis of the law's functioning, leaving a \u201cblack hole\u201d in accountability and data. The recent Balasore case underscores how ICCs, without proper structure and enforcement, are reduced to being symbolic rather than functional bodies.

New GDP, IIP, and CPI Base Year Series to Boost Accuracy of Country\u2019s Economic Data July 31, 2025 Why in the News? India will release a new GDP series with 2022-23 as the base year in February 2026, followed by revised IIP and CPI series, to enhance the accuracy and relevance of key economic indicators. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? National Indicators (Introduction, New GDP, IIP & CPI Series, Measurement Accuracy, Implications, etc.) Introduction The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) is set to overhaul India\u2019s key macroeconomic indicators, beginning with the release of a new GDP series based on the 2022-23 base year on February 27, 2026 . This will be followed by updated series for the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) , which currently use outdated base years from 2011-12 and 2012, respectively. This revision is part of a broader push by the government to ensure more real-time, granular, and representative measurement of India\u2019s dynamic economy , using newer data sources and methodologies. Updates to National Indicators New GDP Series (Base Year 2022-23) The revised GDP series will offer a more accurate reflection of economic activity by updating the reference period from 2011-12 to 2022-23 , incorporating the following improvements: Use of Goods and Services Tax (GST) data for indirect tax estimates Incorporation of UPI transaction data from NPCI Data from the E-Vahan portal for vehicle registrations Administrative records from MCA-21 , RBI , and CGA This marks a significant advancement in capturing the informal and formal sectors more comprehensively. Revised IIP Series (Base Year 2022-23) Scheduled for release from April 2026 , the new IIP series will reflect current industrial structures and consumption patterns. The existing 2011-12 base is now considered outdated due to rapid shifts in manufacturing priorities and technologies. Updated CPI Series (Base Year 2024) Expected in early FY2026-27 , the new CPI base year will be updated to 2024 , capturing recent shifts in household consumption, especially post-pandemic behavioural changes. The new series will also explore alternative data sources for better accuracy, including: Online airfare and rail fare data OTT subscription prices Fuel prices from administrative records Scanner data and web scraping for real-time e-commerce pricing Enhancing Measurement Accuracy The upcoming revisions go beyond base year updates and reflect a shift in India\u2019s statistical infrastructure. MoSPI is adopting technology-driven and data-diverse approaches to capture economic changes more accurately. Key initiatives include: Leveraging e-commerce and digital transactions for consumption tracking Web scraping and online price surveillance for real-time CPI inputs Collaborating with platforms like NPCI for digital payment trends Aligning survey frames with GSTN databases for improved service sector measurement These changes are part of MoSPI\u2019s effort to adapt to a digitally driven, consumption-diverse economy . Launch of New Statistical Surveys National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) Launched in July 2025, the NHTS will assess travel patterns, choice of transport modes, and price elasticity of demand . The data will support transportation planning and be shared with ministries such as the Railways. Domestic Tourism Expenditure Survey (DTES) Also launched in July 2025, DTES will measure household expenditure on domestic tourism, purpose of travel, choice of transport, and use of tourism-specific services. Annual Survey of Service Sector Enterprises (ASSSE) Beginning January 2026 , the ASSSE will systematically track India\u2019s formal services sector , akin to the Annual Survey of Industries for the manufacturing sector. This is expected to bridge long-standing data gaps on: Incorporated service enterprises Revenue and employment metrics Sectoral composition and regional variations MoSPI has already completed a successful pilot study for ASSSE and will use the GSTN database to construct the survey frame. Implications for Policymaking and Research These statistical upgrades are crucial for: Policy formulation based on real-time and reliable data Private sector and investor decision-making International comparability and credibility of Indian economic data Better understanding of informal and digital economy shifts By diversifying data sources and increasing survey frequency (e.g., Household Consumption Expenditure Survey every three years instead of five), MoSPI is aligning with global best practices in statistical governance. \u2018New GDP series coming on Feb 27, IIP and CPI series to follow\u2019.pdf ( Size: 307.4 KB ) Latest Article See All IndiGo Meltdown Dec. 5, 2025, 2:34 p.m. Economics India to Expand Its Busiest Rail Corridors: What\u2019s Planned Dec. 5, 2025, 2:08 p.m. Economics Census 2027 - Counting India, Renewing the Republic Dec. 5, 2025, 1:54 p.m. Editorial Analysis Healt", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

NISAR Satellite - A Landmark NASA-ISRO Collaboration for Earth Observation July 27, 2025 Why in the News? The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is planning to launch the NISAR satellite from Sriharikota onboard a GSLV Mk-II rocket. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? NISAR (Introduction, Features & Capabilities, Applications, India-specific enhancements, Individual Contributions, etc.) Introduction India and the United States are set to launch their most ambitious joint space mission to date, the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) Scheduled for lift-off on July 30 from Sriharikota onboard a GSLV Mk-II , the Rs. 12,000-crore mission has been over a decade in the making and is being considered as one of the world\u2019s most advanced Earth observation missions. NISAR will provide real-time, high-resolution radar data on land deformation, biomass, disaster impact, crop patterns, and climate-related changes, not just for India but globally. It combines NASA\u2019s strength in long-range radar systems with ISRO\u2019s spaceflight engineering and S-band radar technology. Unique Features and Capabilities of NISAR First Dual-Band Radar Satellite for Earth Observation NISAR is the world\u2019s first Earth-observing satellite with dual-frequency synthetic aperture radar (SAR) . L-band radar (1.257 GHz) from NASA can penetrate dense forests and soil layers to detect ground deformation and subsurface movement. S-band radar (3.2 GHz) from ISRO is optimised for surface-level changes like crop growth, biomass estimates, and water levels. This dual-frequency advantage allows for all-weather, day-and-night imaging, even through clouds, smoke, or vegetation cover. Wide Swath and High Resolution NISAR\u2019s radar swath width is 240 km , allowing it to scan large areas in one go. It offers a spatial resolution of 3-10 metres and vertical displacement mapping accuracy down to centimetres , enabling early detection of phenomena like land subsidence in cities . Every spot on Earth will be revisited once every 12 days , providing consistent monitoring. Scientific and Societal Applications NISAR is designed to support research and operations across six broad themes : Solid Earth Processes - Tracking earthquakes, landslides, and land deformation. Ecosystems - Monitoring forests, woody biomass, and biodiversity. Ice and Snow Dynamics - Measuring glacial movements and polar ice thickness. Coastal and Ocean Monitoring - Tracking shoreline erosion, oil spills, and storm surges. Disaster Response - Providing near-real-time damage maps after floods, quakes, or cyclones. Agriculture and Infrastructure - Supporting food security and monitoring subsidence near dams, roads, and reservoirs. During natural disasters, NISAR can provide damage proxy maps within five hours, crucial for emergency relief planning and response. India-Specific Enhancements While NISAR will operate globally at the L-band, ISRO will routinely operate the S-band radar over Indian territory , enabling: Enhanced biomass and soil moisture mapping Improved agricultural forecasting Ionospheric noise correction for high-precision imagery All of this aligns with India\u2019s national needs in agriculture, disaster management, forestry, and rural development . Technical Design and Deployment Once launched, NISAR will be placed in a sun-synchronous polar orbit at an altitude of 747 km. It features a massive 12-metre mesh radar antenna and a 9-metre boom to support deployment and scanning. To overcome size constraints in space, the SAR system mimics a large antenna by collecting radar pulses over time and combining them through complex processing, hence the term \u201csynthetic aperture.\u201d Its advanced SweepSAR mode allows electronic steering of radar beams, providing consistent swath coverage without compromising resolution. Data Access and Ground Infrastructure NISAR\u2019s open-data policy ensures that data is freely available to all users, typically within a few hours of acquisition. NASA\u2019s Near Earth Network (in Alaska, Norway, and Chile) will handle most global data downlinks (up to 3 TB/day). ISRO\u2019s Ground Stations in Shadnagar and Antarctica will manage India\u2019s data needs. India\u2019s National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) will process and distribute NISAR products for domestic use. India-U.S. Contributions The mission exemplifies balanced international collaboration: ISRO contributed the spacecraft bus, the entire S-band radar system, Ka-band telemetry systems, and launch support via GSLV Mk-II. NASA provided the L-band radar, radar structure, antenna, onboard avionics, and high-capacity data systems. The satellite was integrated and tested in Bengaluru, symbolising \u201cMade-in-India\u201d ownership of a global science instrument.

India is reconsidering its restrictive stance on Chinese investments in electronics manufacturing to boost domestic production and strengthen global supply chain integration. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? China\u2019s Blockade (Introduction, Background, Policy Recalibration, Dependency on China, Reasons Behind Rethinking, Challenges & Repercussions) Introduction Nearly five years after adopting a restrictive stance toward Chinese investments in the wake of the 2020 Galwan Valley clashes, India is signalling a calibrated shift in its \u2018China-out\u2019 electronics strategy . In light of its ambitious goals to become a global electronics manufacturing hub, India is re-evaluating Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) rules and barriers previously imposed on China-based companies. The move comes amid changing global trade dynamics, evolving geopolitical realities, and India\u2019s realisation that Chinese firms remain essential in upstream components critical for high-tech manufacturing. Background of the Blockade In April 2020, India issued Press Note 3 , mandating government approval for all FDI inflows from countries sharing a land border with India, effectively restricting Chinese investments. The policy was designed to prevent opportunistic takeovers of Indian firms during the COVID-19 pandemic and reflected a broader pushback following border tensions. This led to the exclusion of Chinese entities from key sectors such as telecommunications, electronic hardware, and infrastructure, even as India\u2019s electronics assembly sector began expanding rapidly under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes . Emerging Signs of Policy Recalibration Amid rising manufacturing needs and limited domestic capacity for advanced components, India has begun showing pragmatic openness to Chinese participation in select areas. Key Developments: Dixon Technologies , a major Indian contract manufacturer, received approval from the Ministry of Electronics and IT to form a joint venture with China-based Longcheer . The JV will produce smartphones, smartwatches, automotive electronics, and AI-powered PCs. NITI Aayog has recommended easing FDI norms for Chinese companies to attract investment and enhance exports . The Economic Survey 2023\u201324 also hinted at the need to revisit restrictions on Chinese firms, acknowledging their integral role in the electronics supply chain. Structural Dependencies on Chinese Components Despite the policy blockade, India has continued to import large volumes of components from China: In FY2023-24, India imported over $12 billion worth of electronic parts from China and another $6 billion from Hong Kong . Together, these regions accounted for over 50% of all component imports , far exceeding inflows from South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, or ASEAN. This underscores a reality: while India has kept finished goods like smartphones from Chinese firms out of its domestic market, it remains reliant on upstream inputs from them to fuel its fast-growing assembly operations. Policy Drivers Behind the Rethink India\u2019s evolving stance is informed by multiple considerations: Manufacturing Ambitions : The government aims to make India a global electronics manufacturing hub. The Rs. 23,000 crore scheme for electronic components manufacturing envisages foreign collaboration, where Chinese expertise remains unparalleled . Global Supply Chain Realignment : The post-pandemic world, U.S.-China trade tensions, and \u201cChina+1\u201d strategies have opened opportunities for India to step in as an alternative hub. The China+1 strategy is a business tactic where companies diversify their production and supply chains away from China. But that requires deeper integration into global supply chains, where Chinese firms are major stakeholders. Geopolitical Pragmatism : India has resumed issuance of tourist visas to Chinese nationals and facilitated diplomatic visits, including External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar\u2019s trip to China, where he stressed that \u201c competition should not become conflict .\u201d Challenges and Repercussions Even as India contemplates easing restrictions: China has retaliated by pulling back workers and making it harder for Indian firms to import capital goods. There have been blockades on rare earth metals and magnets , key to manufacturing electronics, which India has struggled to circumvent. Chinese companies themselves face compliance bottlenecks , procedural delays, and security-related distrust in India. The challenge lies in striking a balance between strategic autonomy and manufacturing dependency .

Recently, India and the U.K. formally signed a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), concluding negotiations that began in January 2022. The pact, finalized after more than three years of intense discussions, aims to significantly boost bilateral trade and deepen economic ties between the two countries. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Key Takeaways from the India-U.K. Trade Deal India-U.K. Trade Deal Goes Beyond Goods \u2014 Services and Workers Benefit Too India-U.K. FTA Features Unusual Provisions on Cars and Government Procurement Conclusion Key Takeaways from the India-U.K. Trade Deal The India-U.K. trade agreement offers substantial tariff reductions on both sides. The U.K. has agreed to remove tariffs on 99% of its product lines, benefiting around 45% of India\u2019s current exports such as textiles, footwear, automobiles, seafood, and fresh fruits like mangoes and grapes \u2014 all of which will now enter the U.K. duty-free. Meanwhile, India will cut or reduce duties on 90% of its tariff lines, covering 92% of U.K. exports to India. This means British whisky, cars, and engineering goods will become more affordable for Indian consumers. Notably, India\u2019s high-value exports like petroleum products, pharmaceuticals, and diamonds already enjoy duty-free access in the U.K. Although the U.K. is not among India\u2019s top trading partners \u2014 accounting for just 3.3% of exports and 1.2% of imports in 2024\u201325 \u2014 the deal marks a significant step in enhancing bilateral trade and economic cooperation. India-U.K. Trade Deal Goes Beyond Goods \u2014 Services and Workers Benefit Too The India-U.K. Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) is not limited to trade in goods; it also includes a strong focus on services \u2014 a key area for India\u2019s economy. Under the agreement, India will open sectors like accounting, auditing, financial services, telecom, and environmental services to U.K. companies, allowing them to offer services in India without setting up a local office, while enjoying the same treatment as Indian firms. India has also agreed to recognise U.K. professional qualifications in fields such as law and accounting (excluding legal practice). On the flip side, Indian companies will now be allowed to establish offices in the U.K. in sectors like IT, consulting, and environmental services. A major win for Indian workers comes through the Double Contribution Convention (DCC), a separate agreement signed alongside CETA. It ensures that 75,000 Indian workers on short-term assignments in the U.K. can continue contributing only to India\u2019s social security system, avoiding double payments in both countries. This is a significant relief for those who typically don\u2019t stay long enough in the U.K. to benefit from its system. India-U.K. FTA Features Unusual Provisions on Cars and Government Procurement While most aspects of the India-U.K. trade deal follow a typical pattern of tariff and service liberalisation, it includes a few notable exceptions. For the first time, India has agreed to reduce import duties on cars through a trade pact. Import duties on large-engine luxury petrol cars from the U.K. will drop from 110% to 10% over 15 years , though within a quota system starting at 10,000 cars and rising to 19,000 in year five. Mid-sized and small cars will also see gradual tariff cuts to 10% by the fifth year, again within quotas. These phased cuts are designed to give Indian carmakers time to adjust. However, electric, hybrid, and hydrogen vehicles are excluded from duty cuts for the first five years to protect India\u2019s emerging green vehicle sector . Another unusual feature is that the U.K. will now be allowed access to Indian government procurement . India will open up around 40,000 high-value central government contracts in areas like transport, renewable energy, and infrastructure, allowing U.K. companies to bid for them. Conclusion The India-U.K. trade deal is not yet in force. It must first be ratified by the Cabinets of both countries, a process expected to take six months to a year. For India, the agreement is not just significant in its own right \u2014 it could also act as a template for future trade negotiations with major economies like the U.S. and the European Union.

India Notifies Environment Protection Rules to Address Chemically Contaminated Sites July 29, 2025 Why in the News? The Environment Ministry has notified the Environment Protection (Management of Contaminated Sites) Rules, 2025. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Contaminated Sites (Introduction, Types, etc.) Environment Protection Rules (Key Features, Scope & Exemptions, Significance, Challenges, etc.) Introduction India has taken a major step toward formalising its response to chemically contaminated sites. Recently, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change notified the Environment Protection (Management of Contaminated Sites) Rules, 2025 under the Environment Protection Act . For the first time, India has codified the procedures to identify, assess, and remediate sites where historical dumping of hazardous chemicals has polluted soil, groundwater, or surface water, posing long-term risks to public health and ecosystems. Understanding Contaminated Sites According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) , contaminated sites are locations where hazardous and other wastes have been historically dumped, often prior to the enforcement of proper regulatory mechanisms. Such sites typically include: Defunct industrial landfills Waste storage and chemical spill sites Abandoned chemical handling facilities India has identified 103 such sites , but remedial operations have been initiated in only seven. Many polluters have ceased operations or lack the resources for clean-up, leaving local communities and environments exposed to toxic hazards. Key Features of the Environment Protection Rules The Environment Protection (Management of Contaminated Sites) Rules, 2025 provide a legally binding, time-bound framework for the entire remediation process: Step 1: Identification and Reporting District administrations must prepare half-yearly reports listing \u201csuspected contaminated sites.\u201d These reports are sent to the State Pollution Control Board or a designated reference organisation. Step 2: Preliminary Assessment The Board or organisation must carry out a preliminary assessment within 90 days to ascertain the likelihood of contamination. Step 3: Detailed Site Survey If contamination is likely, a detailed survey must be completed within the next 90 days , checking for any of the 189 hazardous chemicals listed under the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016. Sites found to be contaminated will be publicly notified and access restricted. Step 4: Remediation Planning A reference organisation comprising scientific experts will propose a remediation plan. The State Board must also identify the person(s) responsible for the contamination within 90 days. Step 5: Cost Recovery and Liability Those responsible must bear the cost of remediation. If the polluter is unavailable or unable to pay, the Centre and State will split the cost under a prescribed arrangement. Criminal liability , if proven to involve loss of life or severe damage, will be addressed under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (2023) . Scope and Exemptions While comprehensive, the rules exclude certain categories already covered by other legislation: Radioactive waste (under the Atomic Energy Act) Mining-related contamination (governed separately) Marine oil pollution Municipal solid waste dump sites This ensures that regulatory overlap is avoided, and specialised agencies continue to govern complex waste streams. Significance of the Rules The notification marks a paradigm shift from fragmented enforcement to structured environmental remediation . Previously, there was no legally codified framework for addressing contaminated sites, leading to regulatory inaction and long delays in clean-up. By defining: Responsibilities of district officials and pollution boards Timelines for assessment and response Polluter-pays mechanism for cost recovery Challenges in Implementation While the rules provide a legal foundation, successful implementation will hinge on: Scientific capacity for hazardous chemical assessment Institutional coordination between the State Boards, CPCB, and district administrations Funding support , especially where no liable party is available Public awareness and community participation in reporting pollution Capacity-building at the district and state levels will be critical to make the framework actionable.

A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Russia\u2019s Kamchatka Peninsula, leading to widespread tsunami warnings across the Pacific. The quake, centered 119 km southeast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky at a shallow depth of 19.3 km, was initially reported as 8.0 but later upgraded. It was followed by a strong 6.9 aftershock. This marks the strongest global quake since Japan\u2019s devastating 9.0 magnitude earthquake in March 2011 that triggered the Fukushima nuclear disaster. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article ? Understanding Earthquake Magnitude and Measurement Kamchatka: A High-Risk Seismic Zone Kamchatka and the Pacific Ring of Fire Tectonic Forces Behind the Ring of Fire Global Earthquake Zones and Their Impact Understanding Earthquake Magnitude and Measurement The 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Kamchatka is classified as a great earthquake, a rare event globally. According to the US Geological Survey (USGS), earthquakes of this scale release immense energy \u2014 with each whole-number increase in magnitude corresponding to roughly 31.6 times more seismic energy . For instance, the Kamchatka quake released over 30 times more energy than Myanmar\u2019s 7.7 magnitude quake in March 2024. While \u201cmagnitude\u201d refers to the measured energy released by an earthquake, \u201cintensity\u201d describes the perceived shaking at specific locations. Earthquake movements are recorded using a seismograph, which tracks the relative motion between the Earth\u2019s surface and a suspended mass to determine seismic activity. Kamchatka: A High-Risk Seismic Zone The Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia\u2019s Far East is one of the world\u2019s most earthquake-prone regions. This 1,250-km landmass has witnessed several powerful quakes in recent history \u2014 including those in 2020, 2006, 1959, 1952, and 1923 \u2014 many of which triggered tsunamis. Historical accounts also mention similar events in 1841 and 1737. Frequent Earthquakes Fuelled by Tectonic Plate Movements The region\u2019s high seismic activity is due to the subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the Okhotsk microplate . Subduction is a geological process where a denser tectonic plate slides beneath a lighter one, causing stress at plate boundaries. This stress, when released, results in earthquakes. The Himalayas were formed by the Indian plate pushing under the Eurasian plate through subduction, making the region highly earthquake-prone. This tectonic interaction forms the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench , which reaches depths of nearly 10 km. As the Pacific Plate descends at a rate of around 86 mm per year, stress builds up along the megathrust fault line, periodically releasing as massive earthquakes and resulting tsunamis in the North Pacific. Kamchatka and the Pacific Ring of Fire The Kamchatka Peninsula is part of the Pacific Ocean\u2019s Ring of Fire , a horseshoe-shaped belt of intense seismic and volcanic activity encircling the Pacific Plate. Stretching over 40,000 km, this zone marks the boundaries of multiple tectonic plates \u2014 including the Eurasian, North American, Indian, Australian, and others \u2014 making it one of the most geologically active regions on Earth. The Ring of Fire spans more than 15 countries , including Russia, Japan, Indonesia, the US, Chile, and the Philippines, all of which frequently experience earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis due to constant tectonic movements. Tectonic Forces Behind the Ring of Fire The intense seismic and volcanic activity in the Ring of Fire is driven by constant tectonic plate movement. Plates frequently slide past, collide, or subduct beneath one another. When rough plate edges get stuck while the rest of the plate continues moving, stress builds up until it suddenly releases, causing an earthquake \u2014 as seen in the recent Kamchatka quake and tsunami. Volcanoes in this zone also form due to subduction, where a denser plate sinks beneath a lighter one , creating deep ocean trenches and magma build-up that fuels eruptions. Global Earthquake Zones and Their Impact The Circum-Pacific Belt (Ring of Fire) is Earth\u2019s most active seismic zone, generating around 80% of major earthquakes. The second-most active is the Alpide Belt , stretching from Indonesia through the Himalayas to Turkey, contributing 15\u201317% of quakes. Though less active, it runs through densely populated regions, making its quakes more deadly. E.g., the sparsely populated Kamchatka Peninsula , despite facing a powerful 8.8 quake, saw no casualties, unlike Nepal\u2019s 7.6 magnitude quake in 2015 that killed over 15,000. The third major zone, the mid-Atlantic ridge , lies deep underwater and causes moderate, less impactful quakes. Earthquake strength is also influenced by fault-line length; a magnitude 9.5 quake is likely the upper limit, as no fault-line spans the Earth to enable a stronger quake.

Flash floods have emerged as a deadly and recurring hazard across India, claiming thousands of lives and damaging infrastructure annually. Tragedies in Himachal Pradesh (July 2025), Kerala\u2019s Wayanad (July 2024), Ladakh (June 2024), and Sikkim (October 2023) underline the severity of the crisis. These sudden and intense floods, primarily triggered by extreme rainfall, have become more frequent with rising global temperatures \u2014 increasing from 132 events in 2020 to 184 in 2022, as per the Union Jal Shakti Ministry. Despite the mounting threat, there remains a lack of detailed research to pinpoint the most vulnerable regions, hampering the effectiveness of mitigation strategies like early warning systems. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Study Related to Flash Floods in India Key Drivers Behind Flash Floods in India Climate Change Intensifies Flash Flood Risk in India Region-Specific Adaptation Key to Mitigating Flash Flood Risks Study Related to Flash Floods in India A recent IIT Gandhinagar study, published in Nature Hazards, addresses the lack of granular data on flash flood vulnerability in India. The study, \u2018Drivers of flash floods in the Indian sub-continental river basins\u2019 , identifies the Himalayas, western coast, and Central India as key hotspots, using hydrological and geomorphological data to map sub-basin susceptibility. In the Himalayas, steep terrain and elevation drive flood risk, while in the West Coast and Central India, rapid runoff\u2014termed \"flashiness\"\u2014plays a key role. The study finds that nearly 75% of flash floods result from a combination of extreme rainfall and already saturated soil, with only 25% due to precipitation alone. Alarmingly, even previously low-risk basins are witnessing rising extreme rainfall, suggesting that climate change may create new flash flood zones in the future . Key Drivers Behind Flash Floods in India The study reveals that only 25% of flash floods in India are caused solely by extreme rainfall . Most incidents result from a combination of heavy precipitation and pre-existing soil saturation. When the ground is already wet, it cannot absorb additional rainfall, leading to rapid runoff and increased flood risk. Notably, only 23% of extreme rainfall events trigger flash floods within six hours. Instead, prolonged periods of both low- and high-intensity rain are more likely to cause such disasters. The study also highlights regional variations. In the western coast and Central India , sub-basins react quickly to rainfall due to their high \"flashiness\" \u2014 the tendency of water levels to rise rapidly. In the Himalayan region , steep terrain and high relief further elevate the risk. Within major river basins like the Ganga , flash flood susceptibility differs \u2014 sub-basins in the southern Himalayan stretch are more prone, while central areas show lower risk. This points to how terrain and local climatic conditions strongly influence flash flood vulnerability. Climate Change Intensifies Flash Flood Risk in India Rising global temperatures are significantly contributing to the increase in frequency and severity of flash floods. As the atmosphere warms, it retains more moisture \u2014 about 7% more for every 1\u00b0C rise \u2014 leading to heavier rainfall events. In India, from 1981 to 2020, the incidence of extreme rainfall during the pre-monsoon season doubled. During the monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter seasons, extreme precipitation increased by 56%, 40%, and 12.5% respectively. Notably, over 75% of flash floods between 1980 and 2018 occurred during the monsoon season. The study also shows that flash floods have risen sharply since 1995, especially in the Brahmaputra, Ganga, and Krishna river basins. Interestingly, many regions that were not previously flood-prone are now experiencing more \"wet hours\" and higher streamflow due to warming temperatures. 51% of non-prone sub-basins showing increased rainfall and 66.5% showing higher streamflow. Conversely, some existing flood-prone areas are seeing a decline in wet hours, indicating shifting climate patterns and flood vulnerabilities. Region-Specific Adaptation Key to Mitigating Flash Flood Risks The study highlights the need for region-specific adaptation strategies tailored to topography, soil conditions, and not just rainfall intensity. Such localized approaches can strengthen early warning systems, improve disaster preparedness, and support long-term resilience planning. Researchers emphasize the urgency of identifying emerging flash flood hotspots and investing in climate-resilient infrastructure to reduce the impact of extreme events.

India-U.S. Trade Standoff Escalates - Tariffs, Penalties, and Strategic Dilemmas July 31, 2025 Why in News? U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s imposition of a 25% tariff on Indian imports , along with a potential 100% penalty for India\u2019s continued purchase of Russian oil and defense equipment, comes just ahead of the August 1 deadline to finalize a bilateral trade deal. As a result, India-U.S. trade standoff escalates, putting ongoing trade negotiations at risk , and complicating India\u2019s trade positioning vis-\u00e0-vis its global competitors, especially China. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Background - U.S.-India Trade Relations New Tariff Measures India\u2019s Response Global Context - Trump's Retaliatory Trade Policy Key Concerns for India Conclusion Background - U.S.-India Trade Relations: Ongoing negotiations: India and the U.S. have been in talks since February 2025 to finalize a Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) aimed at establishing a mutually beneficial trade framework. Mini-deal attempts: Alongside the broader BTA, efforts were underway to create a \u201cmini-deal\u201d to roll back retaliatory tariffs. However, this deal has not materialized before the U.S.-imposed deadline of August 1. New Tariff Measures: Announcement by U.S. President: Trump declared a 25% tariff and an unspecified \u201cpenalty\u201d on Indian imports, effective August 1, 2025. Reasons cited: High Indian tariffs and non-tariff barriers. India\u2019s continued defense and energy purchases from Russia (India is the second-largest buyer of Russian oil after China). Geopolitical concerns over India\u2019s ties with Russia during the Ukraine conflict. Penalty tied to Trump\u2019s pressure campaign to force countries to reduce dependence on sanctioned Russian oil and arms. Public statement: Trump criticized India\u2019s trade practices on Truth Social, labeling them \u201cstrenuous and obnoxious.\u201d India\u2019s Response: Commerce Ministry reaction: The Indian government is \u201cstudying the implications\u201d and reiterated its commitment to a fair and balanced trade agreement. Protection of domestic interests: The ministry emphasized safeguarding the interests of farmers, MSMEs, and entrepreneurs, drawing parallels with its stance during the India-UK Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) negotiations. Global Context - Trump's Retaliatory Trade Policy: Liberation day tariffs: In April 2025, Trump imposed blanket tariffs on countries he accused of levying disproportionately high tariffs on U.S. goods. 90-day pause and bilateral deals: A pause was provided to negotiate individual deals. Agreements were reached with - UK : Reduced car tariffs to 10% and removed aerospace tariffs Indonesia & Philippines : 19% tariff Japan & EU : 15% tariff India left out: India\u2019s inability to secure a deal has now subjected it to higher tariffs and potential trade isolation. Key Concerns for India: Strategic autonomy vs. trade realpolitik: The case underscores challenges India faces in balancing strategic autonomy (especially defense and energy ties with Russia) and economic pragmatism in dealing with major powers. China\u2019s first-mover advantage: China has already concluded advanced-stage negotiations and could secure better terms, including waivers on secondary tariffs. China cut tariffs on U.S. goods from 125% to 10%; the U.S. reciprocated by cutting tariffs from 145% to 30%. Impact on MSMEs and agriculture: Heightened tariffs may affect exports from India's MSME sector and agricultural goods, which are highly price-sensitive. Growing trend of bilateralism: This episode highlights the growing trend of bilateralism in global trade and the declining relevance of multilateral platforms like the WTO. Conclusion: India stands at a crossroads where principled trade diplomacy is tested against economic imperatives. While New Delhi\u2019s refusal to accept a one-sided deal has protected key domestic sectors, the pressure to conclude a deal has intensified due to mounting external tariffs and strategic maneuvering by China. The final shape of the India-U.S. deal may now hinge on top-level intervention , especially a conversation between PM Modi and President Trump, with the goal of minimizing economic damage while preserving strategic interests. newspaper.pdf ( Size: 311.4 KB ) Latest Article See All IndiGo Meltdown Dec. 5, 2025, 2:34 p.m. Economics India to Expand Its Busiest Rail Corridors: What\u2019s Planned Dec. 5, 2025, 2:08 p.m. Economics Census 2027 - Counting India, Renewing the Republic Dec. 5, 2025, 1:54 p.m. Editorial Analysis Health and National Security Cess on Demerit Goods Dec. 5, 2025, 1:48 p.m. Economics A Missing Link in India\u2019s Mineral Mission Dec. 5, 2025, 1:33 p.m. Editorial Analysis A Day to Pause and Come Down to Earth Dec. 5, 2025, 1:27 p.m. Editorial Analysis Rupee Breaches the 90-Mark Dec. 4, 2025, 1:36 p.m. Economics Putin\u2019s Visit: India\u2013Russia Ties and the Road Ahead Dec. 4, 2025, 1:24 p.m. International Relations Judiciary Flags Major Lapses in Critical Care", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

Recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Gangaikonda Cholapuram in Tamil Nadu during the valedictory ceremony of the Aadi Thiruvathirai festival to commemorate the birth anniversary of Emperor Rajendra Chola I. He highlighted the historical achievements of the Chola dynasty and linked their legacy to India\u2019s vision of becoming a developed and united nation. He also highlighted the democratic traditions of the Chola Empire, particularly the Kudavolai system , comparing it with Western ideals like the Magna Carta (1215 CE) and Enlightenment-era political thought. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? The Chola Dynasty PM\u2019s Tribute to Chola Emperors Chola Achievements as a Model for Modern India The Kudavolai System Rediscovering Ancient Indian Democracy Cultural Unity and Preservation Conclusion The Chola Dynasty: It was a Tamil empire that dominated South India and rose in prominence from the 9th (founder - Vijayalaya) to the 13th centuries CE (decline after the reign of Kulothunga I). They were renowned for their military prowess, maritime dominance , and significant contributions to art (advancements in bronze sculpture), architecture (eg., exemplifying the Dravidian style of temple architecture), and literature. At its peak (and spearheaded by Rajaraja I and his son Rajendra I), the Chola empire stretched from the islands of the Maldives to the banks of the Ganges River in Bangladesh , with colonies in Southeast Asia. PM\u2019s Tribute to Chola Emperors: Historical inspiration: PM Modi paid homage to Rajaraja Chola and Rajendra Chola I for their military might, naval expansion, administrative innovations, and cultural contributions. Commemorative coin: A coin was released to honour Rajendra Chola I, commemorating his contributions including the building of Gangaikonda Cholapuram, the Brihadisvara Temple, and Cholagangam lake. Statues announcement: The Centre will install statues of both emperors in Tamil Nadu to reinforce national historical consciousness. Chola Achievements as a Model for Modern India: Economic and strategic vision: Chola-era advancements in trade, defence, water management, and local governance were showcased as templates for India's future development. Strengthening defence: Echoing Rajaraja and Rajendra\u2019s naval legacy, PM Modi emphasized modern India's commitment to national security, citing Operation Sindoor as an example of India\u2019s decisive strategic posture. Democratic foundations: The Kudavolai system introduced by the Cholas was hailed as an early form of grassroots democracy. The Kudavolai System: Electoral innovation: Ballot-pot mechanism: The Kudavolai or \u201cballot pot\u201d involved placing names on palm leaves in a pot and drawing lots publicly by a neutral child, ensuring transparency and fairness. Institutional integrity: The process symbolised a combination of divine will and civic integrity, aimed at preventing dynastic capture of power. Stringent eligibility and disqualification norms: Eligibility criteria: Candidates had to be tax-paying landowners; 35\u201370 years old ; literate in Vedic texts or administrative principles; free from criminal records, debt defaults, alcoholism, or nepotism Disqualification measures: Individuals with financial misdemeanours or ethical lapses were disqualified, even fined or removed as per epigraphic records (e.g., Inscription No. 24 from Epigraphia Indica). Rediscovering Ancient Indian Democracy: Chola contribution to democratic thought: PM Modi emphasized that the Chola Empire practiced structured electoral governance long before Western democracies emerged. The Uttaramerur inscriptions in Tamil Nadu serve as one of the earliest evidence of local self-governance and electoral processes . Administrative decentralisation and local governance: Village councils: Two bodies (Sabha \u2013 for Brahmin villages; and Ur \u2013 for non-Brahmin settlements) had real power over revenue, water management, temples, and justice. Merchant guilds as partners: Guilds like Manigramam and Ayyavole were key in decentralised governance and trade expansion. Symbolic statecraft: Rajendra Chola\u2019s act of bringing Ganga water to his capital symbolised a liquid pillar of victory, merging military conquest with ritual legitimacy. Limitations of the democratic system: Exclusionary nature: Despite being advanced for its time, the Chola model excluded women, landless labourers, and lower castes, highlighting inequality in participatory governance. Modern interpretations: Historians assert that while imperfect, the Chola model was an early blueprint of strategic, decentralised rule and civic integrity . Cultural Unity and Preservation: Pan-Indian cultural bonds : Initiatives like Kashi Tamil Sangamam and Saurashtra Tamil Sangamam were referenced to reflect the government's efforts in cultural integration.

The Medical Boundaries for AYUSH Practitioners July 29, 2025 Context There has been a recent online debate between a hepatologist and an Indian chess Grand Master regarding whether practitioners of traditional medicine can call themselves doctors. It has reignited a longstanding and multifaceted discourse on the status, legal boundaries , and societal role of practitioners of India\u2019s traditional medical systems, particularly Ayurveda and Unani. The controversy goes well beyond titles, touching the very core of public health , legislative policy, and cultural identity in modern India. Historical Framing: Committees and Government Policy The genesis of this debate can be traced back nearly 80 years. The Bhore Committee in 1946 advocated firmly for modern, evidence-based medicine, citing global trends where countries were moving away from traditional medical practices in favour of scientific medicine. Nevertheless, this stance met significant resistance among traditional medicine practitioners, who framed the issue in terms of cultural identity , arguing for the preservation of systems such as Ayurveda on the grounds of their ancient Indian roots. In response to public outcry, the government established the Committee on Indigenous Systems of Medicine , whose 1948 report wrapped the legitimacy of traditional medicine in a narrative of Hindu nationalism. While India\u2019s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru refrained from granting official recognition to these systems , the political tide shifted under Indira Gandhi in 1970. The creation of the Indian Medicine Central Council Act , formally recognised and regulated practitioners of Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani. This legislative framework was updated in 2020 by the National Commission for Indian System of Medicine Act . Divergent Philosophies and the Challenge of Integrative Medicine A crucial point of contention is the fundamental incompatibility between the underlying philosophies of traditional and modern medicine. The curriculum for Ayurvedic practitioners merges ancient concepts like doshas, prakriti, and metaphysical ideas about the soul with select subjects from modern biomedicine, such as anatomy and cell physiology. These frameworks are inherently irreconcilable: Ayurveda attributes illness to imbalances of doshas, while modern medicine explains diseases such as infections through germ theory and pathophysiology. This makes the concept of integrative medicine, a blending of the two approaches , highly problematic at a conceptual and scientific level. Legal Scope and the Right to Prescribe Rule 2(ee) of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945 It allows State governments to declare certain practitioners eligible to prescribe modern medicine, even if they are not MBBS graduates. Many states have used this provision to empower traditional medicine practitioners , resulting in friction with the allopathic community and periodic judicial challenge. Mukhtiar Chand vs The State of Punjab The Supreme Court, in the case of Mukhtiar Chand vs The State of Punjab & Ors (1998), clarified that the right to prescribe a system\u2019s drugs is inseparable from the claim to practice that system, effectively barring Ayurvedic practitioners from dispensing allopathic medicines. Despite this, state governments have continued issuing orders under Rule 2(ee), occasionally in defiance of judicial rulings , leading to repeated litigation, spearheaded by bodies like the Indian Medical Association. At the same time, patients themselves often sue for being misled about the practitioners\u2019 qualifications, especially where the prescription or treatment involved modern medications. Procedural Boundaries and Recent Developments The boundaries extend beyond writing prescriptions to procedural rights. Notably, a 2020 government notification permitted post-graduate Ayurvedic doctors to perform 58 types of surgeries, including operations like gallbladder or appendix removal. This policy is currently under judicial scrutiny. If upheld, it opens unresolved questions, can Ayurvedic practitioners then also use modern anaesthesia and antibiotics for such surgeries? The tension is heightened by the fact that, to cut costs, many hospitals reportedly staff Ayurvedic graduates in positions traditionally held by MBBS doctors. Conclusion At its core, this controversy is not simply about professional titles, but about the standard of care delivered to the public and the integrity of India\u2019s health system. The blurred boundaries, inconsistent legal interpretations, and political appropriations risk undermining evidence-based medicine and patient trust, diverting taxpayer resources into avenues with questionable benefits for public health. As debates ranging from social media to the Supreme Court play out, the most important consideration remains the safety, well-being, and informed consent of Indian citizens, issues that transcend the headlines and demand ongoing scr", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

Five years after its launch, the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has led to notable changes in classrooms, especially in early schooling. However, much of its ambitious vision for overhauling school and higher education remains unfulfilled. Delays caused by Centre-state disagreements and institutional bottlenecks have slowed implementation across the country. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Five Years of NEP 2020: Key Gains and Early Implementation NEP 2020: Key Reforms Still in Progress NEP 2020: Key Sticking Points and Roadblocks Five Years of NEP 2020: Key Gains and Early Implementation The NEP 2020 aimed to transform India\u2019s education system. While complete implementation is ongoing, key reforms have begun to take root. Shift in School Structure and Curriculum The traditional 10+2 structure has been replaced by a 5+3+3+4 system : foundational (pre-primary to class 2); preparatory (classes 3\u20135); middle (6\u20138), and secondary (9\u201312). The 2023 National Curriculum Framework laid out outcomes for each stage. NCERT released new textbooks (classes 1\u20138), merging subjects like history and geography into single volumes. Books for classes 9\u201312 are awaited. Early Childhood Education Gets a Boost NEP aims for universal pre-primary education by 2030. NCERT\u2019s Jaadui Pitara kits and a national ECCE curriculum are now in use. Delhi, Karnataka, and Kerala are enforcing a minimum age of six for class 1, improving readiness but reducing enrolments. However, better Anganwadi training and infrastructure are still needed. Foundational Learning Under NIPUN Bharat Launched in 2021, NIPUN Bharat targets literacy and numeracy by class 3. A recent survey shows 64% average language proficiency and 60% in math\u2014progress, but still below universal goals. Credit-Based Flexibility Introduced To allow flexibility in higher education, the NEP introduced the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) and the National Credit Framework (NCrF). Learners can exit after one, two, or four years with a certificate, diploma, or degree. CBSE is piloting this credit model in schools as well. CUET for Uniform College Admissions The CUET, launched in 2022, standardizes college admissions nationwide, reducing the need for multiple entrance exams, in line with NEP's goals. Expanding Global Footprint of Indian Campuses Institutes like IIT Madras (Zanzibar), IIT Delhi (Abu Dhabi), and IIM Ahmedabad (Dubai) have set up global campuses. Meanwhile, international universities, including the University of Southampton, are entering India, with 12 more awaiting approval. NEP 2020: Key Reforms Still in Progress While several aspects of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 have seen implementation, others are still evolving. These reforms aim to reduce academic pressure, promote flexibility, and encourage inclusive, student-centric learning environments. Reimagining Board Exams To lower the pressure of high-stakes assessments, the NEP proposes flexible board exams. Starting 2026, CBSE will allow class 10 students to appear for board exams twice a year. Karnataka has already piloted this idea. Other education boards are cautiously observing these changes before implementing them. Additionally, the NEP encourages offering all subjects at two levels (standard and higher), but this has only been implemented for mathematics in class 10 by CBSE since 2019-20. Progress Cards with a Holistic Approach NCERT\u2019s PARAKH unit developed new-style report cards including peer and self-assessments. However, most boards have not adopted this approach yet. Slow Rollout of Four-Year Undergraduate Degrees The NEP promotes four-year undergraduate programs with flexible exit options after each year. While central universities and the state of Kerala have begun implementation, progress is slow in other regions due to faculty shortages and inadequate infrastructure in many colleges. Emphasis on Mother Tongue as Medium of Instruction NEP recommends teaching students in their mother tongue at least until class 5 to enhance comprehension and cognitive growth. CBSE has directed affiliated schools to implement this from pre-primary to class 2, with flexibility for classes 3\u20135. Meanwhile, NCERT is developing textbooks in more Indian languages to support this multilingual shift. NEP 2020: Key Sticking Points and Roadblocks Despite several successes, critical components of the NEP 2020 remain stalled due to political resistance, institutional inertia, and lack of consensus. These bottlenecks reflect deep structural and federal challenges in India\u2019s education landscape. Resistance to the Three-Language Formula NEP's proposal for students to learn three languages, at least two of which must be Indian, has been met with strong opposition. Tamil Nadu, which follows a Tamil-English model, views the move as a covert attempt to impose Hindi and has rejected the proposal outright.

Recently, PM Modi, in his Mann ki Baat address, spotlighted the first-ever grassland bird census conducted in Assam\u2019s Kaziranga National Park . This unique initiative aimed to assess the presence, diversity, and habitat preferences of grassland bird species\u2014many of which are endangered or declining in number. This article deals with the Kaziranga grassland bird census, its methodology, and the growing conservation concerns around grassland bird species in India. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Grassland Birds Kaziranga\u2019s Grassland Bird Census: A Conservation Milestone Innovative Acoustic Monitoring in Kaziranga Bird Survey Grassland Birds as Ecosystem Health Indicators Multiple Threats to Grassland Bird Habitats Grassland Birds Grassland birds in India are a unique group of avian species adapted to live in open, grassy habitats. These birds play a critical ecological role as indicators of healthy ecosystems, reflecting the overall status of grassland habitats. Notable examples include the Bengal Florican, Finn\u2019s Weaver, Indian Courser, Great Indian Bustard, and Jerdon\u2019s Babbler. Many grassland bird species are threatened due to rapid habitat loss. Climate change has further intensified these threats. Conservation of grassland birds requires sustained protection of their habitats, scientific monitoring (like acoustic surveys), and strong policy support. Special attention is needed for species endemic to India\u2019s grasslands, as their extinction would be irreversible on a global scale. Kaziranga\u2019s Grassland Bird Census: A Conservation Milestone Recently, a collaborative survey was conducted in Assam\u2019s Kaziranga National Park to record its grassland bird population. The initiative was led by forest officials, scientists, and conservationists, and was sparked by the research of Chiranjib Bora, a doctoral student studying the endangered Black-breasted Parrotbill . Funded by the INSPIRE fellowship from the Department of Science & Technology, his project used acoustic monitoring tools to document bird species in Kaziranga, 70% of which is grassland. The survey aimed to monitor elusive and rapidly declining grassland bird species, many of which are hard to detect due to their small size and camouflaged appearance. It focused on 10 priority species that are either globally threatened or endemic to the Brahmaputra floodplains, such as the Bengal Florican, Swamp Francolin, and Finn\u2019s Weaver. In total, 43 species were recorded, including 1 Critically Endangered, 2 Endangered, and 6 Vulnerable species, as per the IUCN Red List . Innovative Acoustic Monitoring in Kaziranga Bird Survey The Kaziranga grassland bird survey stood out for its use of passive acoustic monitoring. Traditional visual counting was ineffective for these small and shy birds, so acoustic recorders were strategically placed on tall trees near grasslands during their breeding season (March to May), a time when birds are most vocal. These devices captured bird songs over three consecutive days at 29 locations using six recorders. The recorded audio was then analyzed using spectrograms \u2014graphical representations of sound\u2014and a machine learning tool called Birdnet to accurately identify bird species based on their calls. This method enabled researchers to detect species that might have gone unnoticed using conventional techniques. Grassland Birds as Ecosystem Health Indicators The survey\u2019s findings underscore the ecological significance of grassland birds, which serve as vital indicators of habitat health. Their presence confirms that the grasslands of Kaziranga are thriving. A key highlight was the discovery of a breeding colony of the endangered Finn\u2019s Weaver , a species endemic to the Brahmaputra floodplain. For the first time, researchers located over 85 nests of this rare bird atop trees in Kaziranga, shedding light on its nesting behavior and strengthening conservation efforts in the region. Multiple Threats to Grassland Bird Habitats Kaziranga\u2019s grassland birds face serious threats due to both human activities and natural processes . Over the past 40 years, Assam has lost around 70% of its grasslands . Key drivers include overgrazing, conversion of grasslands into agricultural land, and ecological succession, where grasslands naturally transition into forests. This is particularly alarming for species endemic to the Northeast, as their extinction in this region would mean global extinction. Climate change adds another layer of threat, with some species like the Bengal Florican showing significant declines. Further research is needed to understand the full impact of these changes.

The project also includes setting up a hydrogen storage and fuelling facility at Jind , Haryana, with a storage capacity of 3,000 kg of hydrogen. The Research Design & Standards Organisation (RDSO) is leading the design, testing, and validation. The converted train, comprising 10 coaches and capable of carrying over 2,600 passengers, will operate between Jind and Sonepat in Haryana, covering two daily round trips of 356 km. How India\u2019s First Hydrogen Train Will Operate Safely Indian Railways\u2019 hydrogen train project involves retrofitting two diesel power cars with hydrogen fuel cell systems , each storing 220 kg of hydrogen in specially designed cylinders at 350 bar pressure. Given hydrogen's highly flammable nature, multiple safety measures have been built in, including pressure relief valves, leak and flame detection sensors, temperature monitors, and optimized ventilation systems. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies have been conducted to simulate worst-case leak scenarios. Extensive testing of key components\u2014like the traction and auxiliary converters\u2014has been completed. To ensure global safety standards, German firm TUV-SUD has been brought in as an independent safety auditor, while the engineering is led by Medha Servo Drives at ICF Chennai. Hydrogen Fuelling Facility at Jind: Backbone of India\u2019s Hydrogen Train Project A dedicated 3,000-kg hydrogen fuelling facility is being established at Jind in Haryana to support the operation of India\u2019s first hydrogen-powered train. The storage is split into two parts \u2014 2,320 kg at low pressure and 680 kg at high pressure. The facility will function under the safety norms and specifications of the Petroleum Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO), ensuring strict adherence to national standards. Northern Railway is also developing supporting infrastructure, including power supply lines, access roads, and a firefighting tank, to make the facility fully operational. Hydrogen for Heritage: A Green Transport Vision The tested coach is part of the \u201cHydrogen for Heritage\u201d initiative, under which Indian Railways plans to deploy 35 hydrogen-powered trains on heritage and hill routes. Each train will cost around \u20b980 crore, with an additional \u20b970 crore earmarked for ground infrastructure per route. While the running costs of hydrogen-powered trains are currently high, they are expected to fall as scale and efficiency improve. The main appeal of hydrogen lies in its zero carbon emissions, aligning with India\u2019s green energy goals. India\u2019s hydrogen ambitions are not limited to the rail sector. In 2024, Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri presented a hydrogen-fueled bus, developed by Indian Oil, to Bhutan\u2019s Prime Minister during his visit \u2014 underscoring India\u2019s broader commitment to clean mobility.

RBI\u2019s Financial Conditions Index: Tracking Market Health in Real Time June 29, 2025 Why in the News? In a bid to enhance real-time monitoring of the country\u2019s financial health, a recent study by the RBI has proposed the construction of a Financial Conditions Index (FCI) for India with a daily frequency. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Financial Conditions Index (Introduction, Purpose, Structure, Evolution of Financial Conditions, Recent Trends, Significance, Future Outlook) Introduction To enhance real-time assessment of India\u2019s financial ecosystem, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has proposed a Financial Conditions Index (FCI) with a daily frequency. The FCI is a composite indicator that aggregates data across major financial segments to evaluate how tight or relaxed financial conditions are, relative to their historical average since 2012. This move aligns with global central banking practices, where FCIs help gauge monetary transmission, inform policy decisions, and signal systemic stress. Purpose and Structure of the Financial Conditions Index The proposed FCI aims to serve as a dynamic and high-frequency barometer of India\u2019s financial stability by integrating data from: Money Markets Government Securities (G-Sec) Corporate Bonds Equity Markets Foreign Exchange Markets According to the RBI study published in its June 2025 Bulletin, the FCI is designed to: Measure the ease or tightness of financial conditions daily. Capture trends across calm and volatile phases. Serve as a macro-financial surveillance tool for policymakers. The FCI is built using 20 market-based indicators, and values are standardised to reflect changes in financial tightness or looseness in standard deviation units. A positive value indicates tighter conditions, while a negative value suggests easier financial conditions. Evolution of Financial Conditions in Recent Years Post-Pandemic Recovery and Easy Financial Conditions The COVID-19 pandemic led to a dramatic tightening of financial conditions due to a sharp sell-off in equity and corporate bond markets. However, this was followed by an exceptionally loose financial environment in 2021-2022, driven by the RBI\u2019s proactive interventions, including: Large-scale liquidity infusion Policy rate cuts Regulatory forbearance measures During this period, the FCI reached a low of -2.197 in mid-June 2021, indicating extremely easy financial conditions. Periods of Tightening Significant peaks in the FCI were observed during historical stress episodes, such as: July 2013 Taper Tantrum: A peak of +2.826 , primarily driven by tightening in bond and forex markets due to fears of US Federal Reserve tapering. September 2018 IL&FS Crisis: Equity and bond markets contributed to financial tightening, reflecting stress in the NBFC sector. Early 2020 COVID-19 Onset: Market panic due to the global economic shutdown led to a sharp tightening again. Recent Trends and Current Financial Landscape Since mid-2023, India\u2019s financial conditions have largely remained easy , aided by: Robust equity market performance Ample liquidity in the money market Supportive government bond yields From November 2024 , conditions started to tighten slightly, attributed to: Rising global financial uncertainty following the US presidential election Changing risk perception in bond and equity markets Policy normalisation by global central banks However, by March 2025 , the FCI moderated and returned to near-neutral levels, signalling stabilisation. Significance and Policy Implications The introduction of a daily FCI is expected to strengthen India\u2019s macro-financial analysis toolkit. Key implications include: Real-time Monitoring: Enables early identification of stress build-up or excess exuberance. Policy Calibration: Supports timely and data-backed monetary and fiscal policy decisions. Market Guidance: Offers insights to financial market participants regarding liquidity and systemic risk. Globally, FCIs are used by institutions like the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank. For India, a customised FCI tailored to its unique market dynamics will aid in improving monetary transmission and crisis management. Future Outlook As India\u2019s financial architecture becomes increasingly complex, the RBI\u2019s daily FCI will play a pivotal role in ensuring financial stability. By offering a unified, real-time view of multiple market segments, it empowers both policymakers and investors with actionable intelligence. Continued refinement of the index, such as inclusion of newer market indicators, algorithmic adjustments, and integration with other macroeconomic dashboards, can further enhance its utility. newspaper.pdf ( Size: 124.2 KB ) Latest Article See All IndiGo Meltdown Dec. 5, 2025, 2:34 p.m. Economics India to Expand Its Busiest Rail Corridors: What\u2019s Planned Dec. 5, 2025, 2:08 p.m. Economics Census 2027 - Counting India, Renewing the Republic Dec. 5, 2025, 1:54 p.m. Editorial Analysis Healt", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

India Imposes Curbs on Jute Imports from Bangladesh Amid Trade and Strategic Concerns June 30, 2025 Why in the News? India has decided to ban the import of jute products and woven fabrics from Bangladesh through all land routes. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Import Curb on Jute (Background, Items Covered, Impact, Fallout, Policy Response, Way Forward) Background In June 2025, India imposed strict restrictions on the import of jute products from Bangladesh through all land routes, restricting entry only through the Nhava Sheva seaport in Maharashtra. This policy shift, announced via a Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) notification, excludes Bangladeshi goods in transit to Nepal and Bhutan. This move comes amidst rising concerns about Dhaka\u2019s growing strategic proximity to Beijing and persistent trade malpractices by Bangladeshi exporters, including circumvention of anti-dumping duties (ADD). These factors have combined to harm India\u2019s domestic jute industry, especially in states like West Bengal and Bihar . Items Covered Under the Import Curbs The restrictions apply to a wide range of jute-related goods, including: Jute products, Flax tow and waste, Jute and other bast fibres, Single yarn of jute or flax, Multiple folded woven fabrics, Unbleached woven jute fabrics These categories previously enjoyed duty-free access under the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) Agreement . Impact of Subsidised Imports on the Indian Jute Industry India\u2019s jute sector has long suffered due to dumped and subsidised imports from Bangladesh. According to official sources, Bangladeshi exporters continue to receive direct subsidies from their government, undermining Indian manufacturers. Although India imposed anti-dumping duties following investigations by the Directorate General of Anti-Dumping and Allied Duties (DGAD), these measures were circumvented through: Technical exemptions Export through firms exceeding production capacity Mis-declaration and under-invoicing Despite the ADD, jute imports from Bangladesh rose from USD 117 million in FY 2021-22 to USD 144 million in FY 2023-24. Fallout for Indian Farmers and Mills The increased influx of low-cost jute goods has disrupted the domestic market. In FY 2024-25, jute prices in India fell below Rs. 5,000 per quintal, lower than the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs. 5,335, triggering liquidity crises and mill closures. Six jute mills remain shut with Rs. 1,400 crore in unpaid dues, including Rs. 400 crore in legacy liabilities. Over 4 lakh workers are employed in the organised jute sector, with rural livelihoods in West Bengal, Bihar, Assam, and Odisha heavily dependent on the crop. The availability of under-priced Bangladeshi products has also led to under-utilisation of Indian mills, threatening their viability and disrupting local procurement. Policy Response and Strategic Signals The Indian government\u2019s decision to channel imports exclusively through Nhava Sheva port is a calibrated move aimed at: Ensuring better quality checks (especially hydrocarbon oil-free status) Preventing misdeclaration and fraudulent labelling Closing loopholes that allow routing through third countries India's response is not limited to trade concerns. It signals dissatisfaction with Bangladesh\u2019s interim government\u2019s increasing tilt towards China and its inadequate response to repeated trade violations. While Bangladesh has made minor adjustments under diplomatic pressure, it has continued to incentivise the export of value-added jute products, further exacerbating the trade imbalance. Long-Term Outlook: Revival of the Indian Jute Sector India's jute industry is poised for regulatory protection, with more streamlined import monitoring and potential policy reforms on the horizon. Officials indicate a willingness to enforce tighter scrutiny and push back against trade practices that destabilise domestic production. Moreover, the government may explore extending protection mechanisms to raw jute, which currently remains outside the ADD regime, to protect the incomes of Indian farmers. newspaper.pdf ( Size: 635.8 KB ) Latest Article See All IndiGo Meltdown Dec. 5, 2025, 2:34 p.m. Economics India to Expand Its Busiest Rail Corridors: What\u2019s Planned Dec. 5, 2025, 2:08 p.m. Economics Census 2027 - Counting India, Renewing the Republic Dec. 5, 2025, 1:54 p.m. Editorial Analysis Health and National Security Cess on Demerit Goods Dec. 5, 2025, 1:48 p.m. Economics A Missing Link in India\u2019s Mineral Mission Dec. 5, 2025, 1:33 p.m. Editorial Analysis A Day to Pause and Come Down to Earth Dec. 5, 2025, 1:27 p.m. Editorial Analysis Rupee Breaches the 90-Mark Dec. 4, 2025, 1:36 p.m. Economics Putin\u2019s Visit: India\u2013Russia Ties and the Road Ahead Dec. 4, 2025, 1:24 p.m. International Relations Judiciary Flags Major Lapses in Critical Care for Acid Attack Survivors Dec. 4, 2025, 1:13 p.m. Polity & Governance India\u2019s Seven-Point Energy Transition Agenda for 2035 Dec", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

Secondary Pollutants Now a Major Contributor to India\u2019s PM2.5 Burden June 29, 2025 Why in the News? A recent study has revealed that Secondary Pollutants are responsible for nearly one-third of India\u2019s fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? About Pollutants (Primary & Secondary, Key Findings of CREA Study, Emission Control Measures, NCAP Cities, Strategies for Mitigation) Understanding Secondary PM2.5 Pollution in India Particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) is one of the most hazardous components of air pollution , responsible for serious respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Traditionally, primary pollutants such as soot and dust from burning fossil fuels have been considered the chief contributors to PM2.5 levels. However, new research highlights the rising significance of secondary pollutants, especially ammonium sulphate, as key components of India\u2019s air pollution challenge. Primary and Secondary Pollutants: A Distinction Primary pollutants originate directly from emission sources such as vehicle exhaust, coal-fired power plants, and biomass burning. In contrast, secondary pollutants are formed when primary pollutants react with each other or with atmospheric elements like water vapour and sunlight. These reactions lead to the formation of complex particles like ammonium sulphate and ammonium nitrate, which can be equally or more harmful. Key Findings of the CREA Study According to a study by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), secondary pollutants, especially ammonium sulphate, constitute up to 34% of India\u2019s PM2.5 mass. This widespread presence was identified using satellite-based imagery and atmospheric modelling. Nationwide Impact: The average ammonium sulphate concentration across India was found to be 11.9 \u03bcg/m\u00b3. These concentrations are not limited to cities near pollution hotspots, but extend nationwide due to the transboundary nature of air pollution. Coal Plants as a Major Source: Over 60% of India\u2019s sulphur dioxide (SO\u2082) emissions, the precursor to ammonium sulphate, are linked to coal-fired thermal power plants. These facilities become the primary driver of secondary PM2.5 formation. Higher Concentration near Coal Plants: Within 10 km of coal power plants, ammonium sulphate concentrations were 2.5 times higher (15 \u03bcg/m\u00b3) compared to areas beyond that range (6 \u03bcg/m\u00b3). Near these plants, it accounts for 36% of PM2.5 pollution, whereas even distant areas reported a significant 23% contribution. Status of Emission Control Measures Although it is mandatory for Indian coal thermal plants to install Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) systems to reduce SO\u2082 emissions, compliance has been poor; only about 8% of such plants have installed the required units. Further, reports suggest that the government is contemplating rolling back this requirement, which could severely undermine efforts to reduce secondary PM2.5. Impact Across NCAP Cities The findings are particularly significant for the 130 cities identified under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP). These cities are mandated to reduce pollution by 20-30% by 2025-26, but face an uphill task given the high concentration of secondary pollutants. Concentration Levels: PM2.5 levels due to ammonium sulphate in these cities ranged from 3.9 to 22.5 \u03bcg/m\u00b3. Widespread Presence: In 114 out of the 130 NCAP cities, ammonium sulphate made up more than 30% of the total PM2.5 burden. Combined Effect: Including ammonium nitrate, secondary pollutants could constitute up to 50% of PM2.5 pollution in urban areas. Strategies for Mitigation To address the growing burden of secondary pollutants, a multipronged strategy is required. Strict Implementation of Emission Norms: Enforcement of FGD installation in coal power plants must be non-negotiable. Regulatory rollback would be counterproductive to public health goals. Agricultural and Industrial Reforms: Efficient fertiliser management can reduce ammonia emissions, which are a key reactant in forming secondary particles. Source-Specific Action: Pollution mitigation efforts must target both direct emission sources and precursor gases like SO\u2082 and NH\u2083. Transboundary Cooperation: Given the dispersal nature of secondary pollutants, regional coordination between states is essential for effective air quality management. Real-Time Monitoring and Research: Investments in air quality monitoring infrastructure and continuous data-driven research are needed to identify evolving patterns in pollution dynamics.

Axiom-4 Mission with India\u2019s Shubhanshu Shukla Lifts Off from Florida June 26, 2025 Why in News? In a historic moment, India's Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla piloted the Axiom-4 mission aboard SpaceX\u2019s Dragon capsule, which lifted off from Florida\u2019s Kennedy Space Center. Shukla became the first Indian in 41 years to cross the Karman line after Rakesh Sharma in 1984. The K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line is an imaginary boundary at an altitude of 100 kilometers (62 miles) above sea level, which is widely recognized as the boundary between Earth's atmosphere and outer space. PM Modi congratulated Shukla, calling him the first Indian en-route to the International Space Station . What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? India\u2019s Human Spaceflight Milestone and the Road Ahead Leveraging Space as a Strategic and Economic Frontier India\u2019s Human Spaceflight Milestone and the Road Ahead Shukla\u2019s mission marks the beginning of human spaceflight becoming routine for India, similar to its satellite launches. Gaganyaan and Strategic Shifts Though ISRO missed its 2022 deadline for human spaceflight, the Gaganyaan program has injected urgency and focus into the agency, positioning India for strategic advantages in space exploration. Human Spaceflight as a Strategic Capability Human spaceflight is now a key tool for scientific, commercial, and geopolitical leverage. As global space travel risks becoming exclusionary, India\u2019s capabilities ensure it stays in the race. Equal Partnership in Axiom-4 ISRO played an active role in Axiom-4, not merely as a passenger partner. A large ISRO team, including Chairman V. Narayanan, was deeply involved in planning and troubleshooting the mission. Preparing for Future Missions The knowledge gained from Axiom-4 will strengthen the Gaganyaan program, with India\u2019s first indigenous crewed mission expected by 2027. ISRO also plans to establish its own space station and send astronauts to the Moon by 2040. Leveraging Space as a Strategic and Economic Frontier Space is poised to be one of the most impactful technologies of the future, alongside AI, quantum computing, and clean energy, with vast economic and strategic implications. India Among Global Front-Runners Unlike other tech domains where India lags, space is an area where India holds a leading position. However, maintaining this edge will require competing with space giants like the U.S. and China. Private Sector and Economic Potential India\u2019s space capabilities offer significant business opportunities. While India is a top space power, it contributes only about 2% to the global space economy \u2014leaving immense room for growth. Inspiring Youth and Driving Innovation Human spaceflight can inspire young Indians, attract talent to the space sector, and boost innovation, employment, and economic development. Capitalising on Shukla\u2019s Mission Shukla\u2019s journey must be leveraged not just as a symbolic milestone but as a springboard to accelerate India\u2019s space ambitions and build a thriving space ecosystem.

Trump\u2019s Geopolitical Disruption and the Reordering of Eurasia June 26, 2025 Context: The article explores how US President Donald Trump's foreign policy interventions\u2014ranging from military action in Iran to his controversial stance on NATO (questioning its relevance)\u2014are reshaping geopolitical dynamics across Eurasia. It underscores the emergence of Germany as a strategic leader in Europe, the shifting power structures in the Middle East , and the reverberations of US disengagement in the Indo-Pacific . These transformations signal the birth of a new geopolitical order with major implications for global and regional actors, including India . NATO in Flux - Trump and Transatlantic Tensions: NATO under pressure: The 32-member NATO summit (in The Hague) is marked by growing uncertainty about the alliance\u2019s future. Trump\u2019s challenge: His repeated questioning of NATO\u2019s relevance and demands for increased European defence spending are pushing Europe to reassess its security dependencies . Shift in leadership focus: With US reliability under question, Germany is emerging as a new strategic anchor within Europe. Germany\u2019s Strategic Reorientation - From Reluctance to Leadership: Historical backdrop: From a constrained post-WWII role to a reunified \u201c economic giant, geopolitical dwarf .\u201d Turning point (2022): Chancellor (former) Olaf Scholz\u2019s declaration of a Zeitenwende \u2014 a historic turning point \u2014 marked the beginning of Germany\u2019s strategic reorientation . Russia\u2019s Ukraine invasion compelled Germany to allocate \u20ac100 billion to modernise the Bundeswehr (German armed forces) and embrace NATO\u2019s 2% GDP defence spending goal. Leadership under Merz: Chancellor Friedrich Merz is consolidating this transformation by actively leading NATO\u2019s initiatives and deploying combat-ready troops in Lithuania. US Middle East Strategy - Disruption and Normalisation: Military and diplomatic shocks: Trump bombed Iranian nuclear sites while facilitating temporary ceasefires and exploring the \u201c Cyrus Accords \u201d to normalise Israel-Iran ties. Abraham Accords legacy: His earlier term saw Arab-Israel normalisation ; and current strategies aim to deepen these changes, potentially involving Saudi Arabia and Iran. Regional implications: The weakening of Iran and shifting alliances are recalibrating the security dynamics of the Middle East. Indo-Pacific Resonance - Anxiety Amid US Disengagement: Absence at NATO summit: No representatives from Japan, South Korea, Australia, or New Zealand were present\u2014signalling drift in Asia-Europe security linkages. US commitment in doubt: Trump\u2019s reluctance to label Russia as a threat and his non-affirmation of Article 5 of Washington Treaty ( collective defence ) has unsettled US allies in Asia. Need for strategic autonomy: US allies in Asia may pursue more independent and regional security arrangements. Rethinking Eurasian Security - A Structural Transformation: Security needs political recalibration: More defence spending is not enough; countries must reimagine their regional partnerships . Signs of systemic change: From the Ukraine war to strained NATO cohesion and Iran\u2019s internal turmoil, the geopolitical landscape of Eurasia is shifting dramatically . Emergence of new regional poles : A more assertive Germany, Middle East realignments, and Indo-Pacific autonomy represent a tripartite reordering of Eurasia. India\u2019s Strategic Positioning in a Reordered Eurasia: Multi-regional engagement: India straddles the Indo-Pacific, Middle East, and Europe, giving it a unique strategic advantage . Policy diversification: New Delhi is deepening ties with Europe , engaging with the Middle East across divides, stabilizing ties with China and strengthening relationships with ASEAN, Japan, Australia, and South Korea . Balancing act with Trump\u2019s America: Even as India partners with the US, it is building the capacity to navigate an uncertain world order marked by power transitions. Conclusion: The global order is witnessing a tectonic shift as Trump\u2019s disruptive strategies force Eurasia into a structural recalibration. With Germany asserting leadership in Europe, the Middle East moving toward regional balancing, and the Indo-Pacific exploring strategic autonomy, the era of US-led security guarantees is being fundamentally questioned. For India , this moment offers both challenge and opportunity \u2014requiring nimble diplomacy and robust strategic foresight.

India has slipped to 131st out of 148 countries in the 2025 Global Gender Gap Index by the World Economic Forum. While gaps in economic participation, education, and health have improved or remained stable, political empowerment has worsened. Despite more women voting, their representation in top political positions remains low. The upcoming 33% reservation for women in legislatures from 2029 may improve this, but sustained efforts are needed to ensure long-term impact. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Reasons Behind the Fall in the Index Impact of Women\u2019s Reservation on Political Representation From Exclusion to Participation: A Historic Shift Rising Voters, Stagnant Representation Reasons Behind the Fall in the Index India's drop in the 2025 Global Gender Gap Index is primarily due to a decline in political empowerment indicators . The 18th Lok Sabha have 74 women Members of Parliament (MP), marking a slight dip from 2019 when 78 women MPs were elected. Additionally, the share of women in ministerial roles declined from 6.45% to 5.56%, further impacting India\u2019s overall ranking. Impact of Women\u2019s Reservation on Political Representation The 33% reservation for women in Lok Sabha and State Assemblies, passed in 2023, will be implemented only after the next Census and delimitation, making 2029 the earliest possible rollout. If implemented in 2029, the law would raise women\u2019s representation to at least 33%, significantly improving India\u2019s political empowerment metrics on global indices. Current Representation Levels Remain Low The 18th Lok Sabha (2024) has approximately 13.6% women members of the total 543 members . In 2023, women made up only 9% of MLAs across States. Chhattisgarh had the highest share (18%), while Himachal Pradesh had just one woman MLA and Mizoram had none. Limited Timeframe, Uncertain Long-Term Gains The reservation law is valid for only 15 years, meaning it will likely apply to just two general elections (2029 and 2034). Concerns remain about the sustainability of progress beyond that period. Gaps in Ministerial and Leadership Pipelines Even with more women MPs, ministerial appointments may not rise proportionately. Despite decades of 33\u201350% reservation at local levels, there's no structured pathway to elevate women from panchayats to higher politics. From Exclusion to Participation: A Historic Shift In 1952, 28 lakh women were excluded from voting rolls due to being listed only as someone\u2019s wife or mother. Since then, women\u2019s inclusion has drastically improved. Gender Gap in Voting Narrows The voter gender gap has shrunk from 17 percentage points in 1962 to less than 2 points in 2014. In the last two general elections, women voters outnumbered men, partly due to male migration for work . Women as a Key Votebank With growing turnout, political parties now actively court women voters, launching targeted welfare schemes like free bicycles for girls and monthly cash allowances for poor women. The rise in women voters is reshaping electoral strategies and policy priorities, making women a central force in India\u2019s democratic process. Rising Voters, Stagnant Representation Despite the surge in women voters , this has not led to a rise in women candidates fielded by political parties. Parties Avoid Giving Women Winnable Seats Parties often cite \u201clack of winnability\u201d to deny women tickets in stronghold constituencies. Instead, they field women in reserved SC/ST seats to meet multiple quotas. Experts note that women voters don\u2019t vote solely for women. Unlike caste-based voting, women prefer performance and policies over identity. The Need for Systemic Change Since 1952, women candidates have had a higher average winning percentage than men . The issue lies in low nomination rates, with women making up only 8\u20139% of candidates from major parties. Structural barriers, internal party dynamics, and outdated assumptions continue to block capable women from entering the political arena in larger numbers.

Revisit digital search powers under the I-T Bill 2025 June 30, 2025 Context: The Finance Minister's proposal under the Income-Tax Bill, 2025, allows tax authorities to access an individual\u2019s \"virtual digital space\" during search and seizure operations. While justified as necessary due to increasing online financial activity, the move raises serious concerns about privacy, government overreach, and expanded surveillance powers. Existing Legal Framework India\u2019s current tax law, under Section 132 of the Income-Tax Act, 1961, allows for search and seizure in physical spaces like homes, offices, and lockers. These powers are justified by a direct link between the location and the suspected undisclosed income or assets. Expansion to Digital Space The new Income-Tax Bill, 2025, proposes to expand search powers to include an individual's \u201cvirtual digital space\u201d\u2014such as emails, cloud drives, social media accounts, and digital platforms. The inclusion of \u201cany other space of similar nature\u201d makes this scope open-ended and undefined. Concerns Over Privacy and Overreach Digital spaces often hold far more information than required for a tax investigation, including data involving friends, family, and colleagues. This significantly increases the risk of disproportionate intrusion and the violation of privacy. Implications for Confidential Professions The move is particularly worrying for professionals like journalists, whose devices may hold confidential sources and unpublished materials. Seizures based on vague suspicion could impair press freedom and violate protected communication. Operational Challenges The Bill also allows tax authorities to override access codes to digital devices. However, it remains unclear how this will work in practice\u2014especially for encrypted apps like WhatsApp, which were specifically mentioned by the Finance Minister. Judicial Safeguards and Supreme Court Intervention India\u2019s judiciary has consistently upheld that search and seizure powers are to be exercised with restraint , requiring solid evidence beyond suspicion. In 2023, the Supreme Court issued interim guidelines on digital device seizures and called on the government to draft appropriate protocols. Criticism of this Move Lack of Transparency and Oversight The proposed provision lacks essential safeguards such as judicial oversight, accountability , and clarity, violating core democratic principles. It does not require authorities to disclose the \u201creason to believe,\u201d undermining transparency. Ignoring the Nature of Digital Data The law fails to appreciate the complexity and sensitivity of digital information. Electronic devices often hold vast, layered personal and professional data that require higher standards of protection. Absence of Legal Guardrails There are no clear checks and balances in the proposed provision. Without specific procedural safeguards, it opens the door to potential misuse and abuse of power by tax authorities. Global Best Practices Emphasize Safeguards Canada\u2019s Section 8 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects against unreasonable searches, requiring: Prior authorisation Approval by a neutral authority Reasonable and probable cause In the United States, the Taxpayer Bill of Rights guarantees due process and limits intrusive action. The Supreme Court ruling in Riley vs California requires warrants to access digital devices, acknowledging the highly personal nature of such data. Violation of the Proportionality Principle The proposed provision grants sweeping access to personal digital data without requiring warrants, relevance checks, or distinctions between financial and non-financial data. This violates the proportionality test laid down in the Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India judgment . Supreme Court\u2019s Four-Fold Test The Supreme Court mandates that restrictions on privacy must: Serve a legitimate aim Be necessary Use the least intrusive means Be proportionate The proposed provision fails to meet these criteria , particularly on necessity and intrusiveness. Way Forward Digital Enforcement Must Respect Rights The solution isn\u2019t to discard digital enforcement, but to align it with principles of legality, proportionality, and transparency. Enforcement must protect, not erode, constitutional rights. Unchecked Surveillance Is Overreach Allowing unfettered access under the guise of regulation amounts to surveillance, not governance. It undermines public trust and violates the right to privacy. Hope for Reform Through Legislative Scrutiny There is still scope for correction. The Select Committee reviewing the Bill should: Narrow the definition of \u201cvirtual digital space\u201d Mandate prior judicial warrants Require disclosure of reasons Establish grievance redress mechanisms Conclusion The path forward must balance enforcement with constitutional protections . Without adequate checks, the proposed law risks becoming a tool of intrusion rather than accountabil", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

A Lofty Concept, a Governor, and Unwanted Controversy June 26, 2025 Context The recent controversy in Kerala surrounding the placement of a Bharat Mata picture by the Governor at official functions has ignited a significant debate about constitutional propriety, symbolism, and the role of historical imagery in public institutions. At the heart of this issue lies a broader question: can unofficial, emotionally charged symbols be given official status in a constitutional democracy? This incident, seemingly minor, raises critical concerns about constitutional decorum , the limits of gubernatorial authority, and the dangers of political symbolism being conflated with national identity. An Overview of the Controversy The controversy began when the Governor of Kerala displayed a painting of Bharat Mata, a female figure clads in a saffron sari, holding a spear, and accompanied by a lion, at official events held in Raj Bhavan. The room, adorned with this image and a brass lamp placed before it, has become the site of official functions. The Governor regularly bows before the picture, offers floral tributes, and lights the lamp , treating it as an integral ceremonial part of the function. The Kerala government, however, has raised objections on constitutional grounds , arguing that such a representation of Bharat Mata is not a nationally recognised symbol, unlike the national flag, anthem, or emblem. In protest, the Kerala government has opted out of official events held under the visual presence of this picture. Symbolism, The Freedom Struggle, The Constitutional and Legal Standpoint Symbolism and The Freedom Struggle Historically, the slogan \u2018Bharat Mata ki Jai\u2019 was a potent emotional cry during the Indian freedom struggle. Chanted at the height of anti-colonial resistance, it stirred patriotism among freedom fighters. However, this powerful slogan operated largely without a consistent or official visual representation of Bharat Mata. The emotional resonance was tied more to the abstract idea of the nation than to a standardised image. While the personification of India as a mother gained traction in the 19th century, the modern, saffron-clad depiction of Bharat Mata has clear ideological roots. Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay first introduced the idea of a motherland in Anandamath, though his symbol was Banga Mata, not Bharat Mata. Abanindranath Tagore later painted a goddess-like image that Sister Nivedita popularised as Bharat Mata. Yet, even during the peak of the national movement, no particular image of Bharat Mata was ever adopted officially. The Constitutional and Legal Standpoint The Indian Constitution provides no legal or symbolic status to any image of Bharat Mata . While emotional and cultural expressions are part of the democratic ethos, they cannot override constitutional principles or official protocol. The picture used by the Governor, although historically grounded, has never been formally adopted by the nation. Furthermore, it has become prominently associated with ideological organisations like the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). This association politicises the symbol, making its presence in official state functions problematic and potentially exclusionary in a secular and pluralistic nation. B.R. Ambedkar\u2019s emphatic declaration in the Constituent Assembly that a Governor has no functions which he can discharge by himself underlines the constitutional limits on the gubernatorial office. The Governor is bound by the advice of the elected government , especially in matters concerning the conduct and setting of official functions. Displaying a symbol that is neither nationally endorsed nor inclusive in its appeal breaches the principles of impartiality and secularism that govern constitutional offices. The Nehruvian Ideal of Bharat Mata, Nationalism, Imagery, and Modern Governance The Nehruvian Ideal of Bharat Mata Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s interpretation of Bharat Mata in The Discovery of India is particularly instructive . For Nehru, Bharat Mata was not a deity or a goddess-like figure but a symbol of the people of India, their hopes, struggles, and collective destiny. When asked to explain the cry \u2018Bharat Mata ki Jai\u2019, Nehru described Bharat Mata as \u2018these millions of people,\u2019 emphasising the humanistic and democratic core of the nation. This view resonates more closely with the secular and inclusive ideals enshrined in the Constitution, as opposed to mythologized or sectarian visual symbols. Nationalism, Imagery, and Modern Governance The debate reflects a deeper tension in Indian nationalism : the contrast between inclusive civic nationalism and symbolic ethno-religious nationalism. Gandhi\u2019s nationalism was rooted in moral principles, pluralism, and unity in diversity. In contrast, the use of anthropomorphic images with religious or sectarian connotations tends to exclude rather than unite , reinforcing id", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

Practising Equality in Constitutional Courts June 28, 2025 Context On May 13, 2025, the Supreme Court of India passed a judgment in Jitender @ Kalla vs State (Govt.) of NCT of Delhi, revisiting its earlier decisions in Indira Jaising vs Supreme Court of India (2017 and 2023). The judgment focused on refining the methodology for designating lawyers as senior advocates. Despite its significant implications for judicial equity and democratic access to justice, the ruling received little public attention, mistakenly perceived as an internal matter of the judiciary. However, the issue cuts much deeper, revealing the systemic inequality entrenched within the Indian legal profession. The Legal Profession\u2019s Public Character and Systemic Inequality The legal profession, unlike many others, bears a distinctly public character. It forms a cornerstone of both judicial and political democracies. Consequently, any stratification within this profession, especially one sanctioned by statute and reinforced by judicial endorsement, has profound repercussions on the integrity of the justice delivery system. India's legal hierarchy, particularly the designation of senior advocates under Section 16 of the Advocates Act, 1961, embodies what may be described as a form of legal plutocracy. This classification, predicated on ambiguous criteria such as \u2018standing at the Bar\u2019 and \u2018special knowledge or experience in law, \u2019 institutionalises inequality within a profession that should ideally be democratic and egalitarian. The resultant divide undermines the constitutional promise of equality before the law and reduces access to justice for marginalized voices. Comparative Analysis: Lessons from the United States The danger of elite capture in the legal profession is not unique to India. The American experience , as detailed in Reuters' 2014 report \u2018The Echo Chamber, is illustrative. The study revealed that a mere 66 out of 17,000 lawyers who petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court controlled 43% of the appeals , a clear indication of corporate and elite dominance. Though India has not replicated this model wholesale , the structural vulnerability is apparent. With the senior advocate system, Indian courts risk gravitating toward a similarly exclusionary structure where a privileged few monopolize legal representation in constitutional and high-stakes matters. Judicial Response and Its Limitations The Supreme Court's attempts to reform this process , notably through the 2017 Indira Jaising judgment, and more recently in Jitender, have focused largely on procedural refinements rather than substantive reform. While the Court acknowledged that the point-based system for designation was highly subjective, it chose not to strike down the classification altogether. Instead, it suggested peripheral adjustments, such as High Courts framing new rules without addressing the core constitutional challenge: whether this classification passes the test of Article 14 (equality before law). In fact, the Jitender judgment paradoxically critiques the very guidelines laid down in Jaising as subjective, yet continues to endorse the structure. This internal inconsistency raises questions about the coherence of the Court\u2019s reasoning. The deeper issue whether such classification serves any public or constitutional interest, remains ignored. The Core Constitutional Challenge and Consequences The Core Constitutional Challenge The challenge to Section 16 and related Supreme Court Rules was grounded in the argument that the classification is inherently arbitrary and discriminatory. The designation does not necessarily advance the legal system ; rather, it reinforces social stratification. Many competent lawyers who are not designated continue to contribute significantly to the cause of justice. As such , the distinction lacks a rational nexus with the objectives it purports to serve. Nevertheless, the Court sidestepped this argument, asserting that as long as procedural safeguards exist , the classification can be maintained. This is problematic. Consequences: Intellectual Apartheid and Judicial Insularity The stratification of the legal profession creates what can only be described as intellectual apartheid. A small cadre of star lawyers dominates the judicial discourse, marginalising thousands of competent but less visible lawyers. This insularity narrows the perspectives available to the Court, impacting the richness and representativeness of legal arguments, especially on matters of national importance. The challenge to the Waqf (Amendment) Act serves as a recent example , where only a select few voices were heard. Conclusion A truly democratic legal profession should prioritise competence, commitment to justice , and representation of diverse voices, not social pedigree or courtroom visibility. The time has come for India to evolve a more equitable, transparent, and constitutionally sound system that recognizes all a", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

Enabling Voting Rights for Migrants June 26, 2025 Context Bihar, with one of the highest out-migration rates in India, is set for elections later this year. In the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, the state's voter turnout was only 56%, well below the national average of 66%. A key reason for this low turnout is the large migrant population, many of whom could not return home to cast their votes. In this context, the present article analyses various options to enable migrants\u2014both inter- and intra-State\u2014to exercise their voting rights, highlighting the need for a multi-pronged approach. Migration Trends and Risk of Voter Disenfranchisement As of 2021, India's migration rate stood at 28. 9%, with most migrations occurring for marriage, especially among women . However, about 10% of migrants relocate for work, a figure notably higher in States like Bihar. With rising labour migration from poorer to richer regions, many citizens risk being disenfranchised unless voting mechanisms for migrants are implemented. Although public discussions have taken place and the Election Commission of India proposed a concrete solution in 2024, no unified system to ensure voting access for migrants has yet been adopted. Distinct strategies are required for different categories of migrants. Proposed Measures for Intra-State Migrants Intra-State migrants\u2014who make up around 85% of the migrant population\u2014could potentially return home to vote if supported adequately. Enforce statutory holidays on polling days to allow workers to vote without wage loss. Arrange special bus services before and on polling days to facilitate travel to home constituencies. Mechanisms to Enable Voting Rights for Inter-State Migrants Need for Tailored Mechanisms Inter-State migrants, especially those in informal, low-paying jobs, face unique challenges in exercising their voting rights. A one-size-fits-all approach is inadequate; multiple mechanisms must be explored and implemented. Remote Electronic Voting Machines (RVMs) Pilot Initiative: In 2023, the ECI introduced Remote Electronic Voting Machines (RVMs) , each capable of catering to 72 constituencies. RVMs, developed by BEL and ECIL, enable safe, non-networked remote voting for migrants. It used dynamic ballot displays and barcode-based constituency identification for up to 72 constituencies. Challenges: Political parties raised concerns about lack of transparency, identification issues, and the model code of conduct. Administrative Hurdles: The need to pre-register migrants, assess constituency-wise presence, and deploy RVMs across cities makes scaling difficult\u2014especially in Lok Sabha elections. Despite flaws, RVMs represent a significant first step. With improvements and consultations, they could eventually benefit many migrants. Postal Ballots Existing Model: Used for armed forces personnel. Extension to Migrants: Would require pre-registration, ballot issuance, and return mechanisms. Feasibility: Easier to implement than RVMs but still requires major logistical coordination by the ECI. Changing Voting Constituency Target Group: Long-term migrants with at least six months of residence. Advantages: Empowers migrants to influence local governance and push for inclusive policies. Concerns: May face resistance from local residents but offers long-term democratic integration of migrants. Enrolment of Women Migrants Key Demographic: A large number of women migrate post-marriage. Recommendation: Targeted voter registration drives should be launched to include them in electoral rolls at their new residences. A combination of RVMs, postal ballots, constituency-switching, and focused enrolment drives\u2014especially for women\u2014can ensure greater electoral inclusion of India\u2019s vast migrant population. Conclusion Given the diversity among migrants, enabling their voting rights is complex. A mixed approach combining multiple mechanisms is essential to ensure broader participation of both inter- and intra-State migrants.

The Supreme Court stated that summoning lawyers for advising clients violates their rights and undermines the autonomy of the legal profession, which is protected by statutory provisions. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Background of the Case Privileges Associated with the Attorney-Client Communication Judicial Stand on Summoning Lawyers The Significance of Attorney-Client Privilege for Legal Sanctity Background of the Case The Supreme Court made its remarks while hearing a case involving a Gujarat-based lawyer summoned by police for helping his client secure bail in a loan dispute. The observation followed the Supreme Court Bar Association's criticism of the Enforcement Directorate's summons to senior advocates Arvind Datar and Pratap Venugopal. They were called in connection with an Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOPs) probe involving Care Health Insurance and former Religare Enterprises chairperson Rashmi Saluja. Privileges Associated with the Attorney-Client Communication The Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023 (replacing the Indian Evidence Act, 1872), grants privileged status to communications between lawyers and their clients, protecting them from third-party disclosure. Conditions for Disclosure Section 132 of the BSA prohibits advocates from disclosing client communication, even post-employment, except when: The client consents, The communication involves illegal activity, The lawyer observes criminal conduct during employment. Exemption from Testifying Lawyers are exempt from testifying or disclosing client communications in any form\u2014oral, written, or electronic. Exclusive Protection for Legal Professionals This privilege is exclusive to legal professionals ; other experts like chartered accountants, company secretaries, and cost accountants do not enjoy such protection. Judicial Stand on Summoning Lawyers Indian courts have consistently held that police or prosecution agencies cannot summon lawyers merely for advising their clients. A. V. Pavithran v. CBI (2024) \u2013 Bombay High Court Ruling The Bombay High Court quashed a CBI summons to Advocate Pavithran, asserting that legal advice is privileged under Section 126 of the Indian Evidence Act (now Section 132 of the BSA). The court reiterated the principle: \u201conce privileged, always privileged.\u201d Praram Infra v. State of M.P. (2025) \u2013 Madhya Pradesh High Court Decision The Madhya Pradesh High Court also quashed summons issued to Advocate Rahul Maheshwari, emphasizing that an advocate who is neither an accused nor a witness should not be summoned. The court again cited the protection under Section 126 of the Evidence Act. The Significance of Attorney-Client Privilege for Legal Sanctity Attorney-client privilege, as upheld by Section 132 of the BSA, 2023 and reinforced by the Advocates Act, 1961, is central to maintaining the integrity of the legal profession and the rule of law. This privilege ensures lawyers can provide impartial and fearless advice without fear of coercion or reprisal. Summoning legal professionals without any evidence of wrongdoing not only violates this protection but threatens the institutional balance between the Bar, Bench, and Executive. Such actions create a chilling effect\u2014discouraging legal advocacy, fostering self-censorship, and undermining public interest litigation and constitutional advocacy.

A China-led Trilateral Nexus as India's New Challenge June 28, 2025 Context China recently held its first trilateral meeting with Pakistan and Bangladesh in Kunming, following a similar May meeting with Pakistan and Afghanistan. These China-led trilaterals aim to boost regional cooperation and revive Pakistan\u2019s role in regional dynamics. Strategically, Beijing is leveraging India\u2019s tense relations with Bangladesh and growing footprint in Afghanistan to counter New Delhi\u2019s influence and divert its attention. A War That Redefined Regional Alignments The 1962 India-China war shaped lasting regional dynamics. Post-war, China found a strategic ally in Pakistan to contain India and safeguard its own geopolitical interests. China-Pakistan Strategic Bond Pakistan views China as a reliable partner for economic and military support. By the end of 2024, Pakistan owed China over $29 billion, and over 80% of its arms imports were Chinese in origin. China's Diplomatic Shielding China has repeatedly shielded Pakistan-backed terrorists at the UN and other platforms, solidifying their alliance beyond bilateral trade and defense. Operation Sindoor and Recent Tensions During India\u2019s Operation Sindoor in May 2025\u2014retaliation for the Pahalgam terror attack\u2014China criticized India\u2019s response as \u201cregrettable\u201d and pushed for dialogue. It endorsed Pakistan\u2019s call for an investigation instead. The conflict saw Pakistan deploying Chinese-made equipment\u2014from radars, drones, and missiles to fighter jets\u2014underscoring Beijing\u2019s deep military support. Post-Conflict Diplomacy and Trilateral Outreach Soon after the escalation, Pakistan\u2019s Foreign Minister met his Chinese counterpart to reaffirm their \u201ciron-clad friendship.\u201d The subsequent trilateral meetings with Afghanistan and others are seen as a diplomatic extension of that bond. Resurfacing an Old Strategy The China-Pakistan \u201cplus one\u201d strategy\u2014using third countries to isolate India\u2014is not new. As early as 1965, Pakistan considered using East Pakistan, China, and Nepal to sever India from its Siliguri Corridor. The idea appears to be reviving, especially as both Beijing and Rawalpindi confront a confident and assertive India. India\u2019s Assertive Posture India\u2019s retaliatory strikes post-Uri (2016), Pulwama (2019), and Pahalgam (2025) show a decisive shift from past restraint. No tolerance for nuclear blackmail Indus Waters Treaty suspended, trade halted, port access restricted Military strikes have weakened Pakistan\u2019s operational confidence Diplomatically, India has worked to isolate Pakistan globally Stiff Pushback Against China India\u2019s response to Chinese aggression in Doklam and Galwan surprised Beijing. It included: Increased cooperation with like-minded democracies Expanded presence in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia Diplomatic outreach by India has slowed China\u2019s regional influence. Shifting Regional Ties India\u2019s pragmatic diplomacy is undermining Chinese momentum in South Asia: Maldives: President Muizzu, once anti-India, has turned to Delhi to save the economy. Nepal: Despite signing BRI agreements, funding disputes stall progress. Sri Lanka: President Anura Kumara Dissanayake visited India before China. Bangladesh: Despite tensions, India allowed trilateral energy cooperation with Nepal. China's Strategic Trilateral Push China\u2019s trilateral meetings with Afghanistan and Bangladesh aim to: Reclaim influence post-regime changes in 2021 (Afghanistan) and 2024 (Bangladesh) Offset India\u2019s deepening ties with the Taliban Reinforce Pakistan\u2019s relevance in the region Potential Security Threats China-backed Pakistan is using historic linkages with Bangladesh and Afghanistan to: Foster cross-border terrorism. Distract India with security threats. Undermine India's neighbourhood influence, opening space for Chinese BRI investments and geostrategic dominance. China \u2013 The Primary Strategic Challenge Recent regional shifts reaffirm that China\u2014not Pakistan\u2014is India\u2019s most formidable challenge. Beijing is leveraging its growing influence and alliance with Pakistan to counter India\u2019s rising confidence and regional outreach. Trilateral Nexus as a Geopolitical Tool China views the trilateral mechanism as a way to undermine India\u2019s diplomacy and distract it with fresh security and political challenges, especially as India builds regional consensus against terrorism.

India Rejects Arbitration Court Ruling Under Indus Waters Treaty June 28, 2025 Why in the News? India has rejected a Court of Arbitration ruling that issued a \"supplemental award\" on its competence concerning the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects in Jammu and Kashmir. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? About Grievance Redressal Mechanism News Summary (Treaty Review, India\u2019s Rejection, Implications, etc.) Grievance Redressal Mechanism under the Indus Waters Treaty The Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), signed in 1960 between India and Pakistan with the World Bank as a guarantor, includes structured mechanisms for resolving disputes and differences over the interpretation and application of its provisions. These mechanisms include: Permanent Indus Commission (PIC): Comprising one commissioner from each country, the PIC serves as the first tier for resolving issues. It conducts annual meetings and field visits and works to resolve technical and operational matters through mutual consultation. Neutral Expert Mechanism: For technical differences that cannot be resolved at the PIC level, either party can approach the World Bank to appoint a neutral expert. The expert\u2019s mandate is limited to factual and technical questions, and their decisions are binding on both parties. Court of Arbitration (CoA): For disputes involving legal interpretations or the validity of treaty provisions, a Court of Arbitration can be constituted. However, both countries must agree on invoking this mechanism. Any deviation from mutual consent challenges the treaty\u2019s fundamental design. India has consistently favoured the Neutral Expert route, while Pakistan has pushed for the arbitration court on issues like the design of hydropower projects. India maintains that parallel proceedings before both mechanisms violate the treaty's structure and purpose. India\u2019s Rejection of the Court of Arbitration\u2019s Authority Recently, the Hague-based Court of Arbitration issued a supplemental award asserting its jurisdiction over disputes concerning the Kishenganga and Ratle hydropower projects in Jammu and Kashmir. India has categorically rejected the authority of the Court of Arbitration, labelling it \u201c illegally constituted \u201d and devoid of legal legitimacy. Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) stated that the very constitution of the court violates the provisions of the IWT, and hence, any decisions or awards issued by it are \u201cper se void.\u201d India reiterated that it never recognised the court\u2019s authority and views its functioning as lacking legal standing. In response to Pakistan's request, the arbitration court examined India\u2019s move to place the IWT in abeyance after the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack. India clarified that its suspension of treaty obligations was a sovereign act justified under international law and that a tribunal formed without mutual consent has no jurisdiction over such decisions . Pakistan\u2019s Legal Strategy and India\u2019s Firm Opposition India has accused Pakistan of manipulating international legal mechanisms to divert global attention from its support of cross-border terrorism. The MEA described the court\u2019s proceedings as a \u201c charade at Pakistan\u2019s behest \u201d and reiterated that Pakistan must permanently renounce terrorism before India considers resuming its treaty obligations. The legal confrontation stems from longstanding differences over the design parameters of the Kishenganga (Jhelum tributary) and Ratle (Chenab) hydroelectric projects. In 2015, Pakistan approached the World Bank for the appointment of a Neutral Expert, but later shifted to seek arbitration in 2016. India, upholding the original treaty provisions, continued to insist on the Neutral Expert route, rejecting arbitration as a breach of the IWT's sequential dispute resolution framework. Treaty Review, Neutral Expert Engagement, and Strategic Implications In October 2022, in an unusual move, the World Bank appointed both a Neutral Expert and constituted a Court of Arbitration simultaneously, based on separate requests by India and Pakistan. India objected to this parallel process, asserting it violated the treaty\u2019s single-track mechanism for handling disputes. Consequently, while India has actively participated in the Neutral Expert proceedings, it has refused to recognise or engage with the arbitration court. India\u2019s recent decision to suspend treaty obligations is part of this larger recalibration. The government maintains that under international law, this action is valid until Pakistan takes verifiable steps to cease support for terrorism. These developments mark a significant turning point in the water-sharing relationship between the two nations, with far-reaching diplomatic and political implications for the future of the treaty.

The Israel-Iran Ceasefire \u2014 Managing the Blowback June 27, 2025 Context The recent cessation of hostilities between Israel and Iran , as announced by U.S. President Donald Trump, marks a potential turning point. However, despite the announcement of peace, the region remains mired in geopolitical ambiguity and latent volatility. Unless the principal actors show strategic restraint, the conclusion of this grim chapter may be as disruptive as its onset. Military Gains, Strategic Realignments & Iran\u2019s Future Military Gains and Strategic Realignments Over the past 21 months, Israel, backed firmly by the United States, has achieved a string of military victories that, while tactically impressive, may ultimately be pyrrhic. Hamas has been significantly degraded in Gaza , although some Israeli hostages remain in captivity. Hezbollah in Lebanon, once considered the most formidable non-state actor, has been rendered ineffective. Syria\u2019s once-hostile al-Assad regime has been replaced by a feeble Islamist government. Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels , though initially disruptive, were subdued by overwhelming force. Most significantly, Israel and the U.S. claim to have dismantled Iran\u2019s decades-long pursuit of nuclear capabilities. In tandem with targeted assassinations of Iranian scientists and generals, this marks a major blow to Tehran\u2019s regional ambitions. While these military accomplishments have shifted regional power balances , they have also stirred a hornet\u2019s nest of unresolved political questions. Iran\u2019s Future: A Strategic Pivot The most pressing geopolitical question now is: What lies ahead for Iran? As the region\u2019s most populous and historically defiant state, Iran\u2019s trajectory will significantly influence West Asia\u2019s future. Despite enduring severe sanctions, economic hardship, and war, Tehran remains a strategic fulcrum. Its ideological opposition to Israel and the West, coupled with its network of proxy forces, ensures its continued relevance in regional affairs. There exists a delicate paradox: while the victors officially eschew regime change in Tehran, the existence of the current Mullah-led government, unrepentant and ideologically rigid, presents an \u2018unfinished agenda\u2019 for Washington and Jerusalem. The aim now is to neutralise Iran\u2019s WMD ambitions through sanctions and intrusive inspections. The Dilemma of Regime Change The notion of an externally enforced regime change in Iran is fraught with risk and the failures of similar attempts in Iraq and Afghanistan are cautionary tales. Iran\u2019s deeply rooted political structure, its nationalist sentiment, and the fractious ethnic composition of its population render a direct intervention unfeasible and potentially disastrous. Instead, a subtler approach is likely , an attempt to internally reorient the regime. However, this is easier said than done. The Revolutionary Guards and radical clergy hold substantial power , with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, now 86, favouring the status quo. The succession race, likely between Khamenei\u2019s son Mojtaba and Hassan Khomeini (grandson of the Islamic Republic\u2019s founder), is crucial . Mojtaba represents ideological continuity , while Khomeini may herald a pragmatic reset. This transition, uncharted for over three decades, carries profound implications for both Iran and the broader region. The Compounded Crisis of Gaza Amid the larger geopolitical theatre, the Israel-Palestine conflict remains unresolved and increasingly desperate. The recent war has further complicated matters, with Gaza facing mass starvation and staggering civilian casualties. The West Bank, too, is destabilising under settler violence and a stagnating Palestinian Authority under the aged Mahmoud Abbas. There is concern that the U.S. administration may attempt to resurrect its controversial plan to deport Gazans and repurpose the territory into a commercial \u2018international riviera\u2019- a vision that is both ethically fraught and politically implausible. Post-war trauma has left Gazans in a survivalist limbo, making long-term planning nearly impossible. The Way Ahead: A Moment of Reckoning for West Asia This moment offers West Asia a rare opportunity. Should Iran, Israel, and the U.S. resist the temptations of triumphalism and instead embrace moderation, the region could move toward a more peaceful, stable future. The benefits are tangible: lower oil prices, stabilised logistics, and reduced extremism and terrorism. Conversely, failure to consolidate peace could plunge the region back into the familiar cycle of violence punctuated by fragile truces. The path forward demands statesmanship over brinkmanship, negotiation over domination, and vision over vengeance. Conclusion If the major actors, Israel, Iran, and the United States, choose moderation over triumphalism, and focus on rebuilding over posturing, a new era of peace and economic cooperation could emerge. Stability in West Asia would bring global benefits", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

India Launches Pilot Scheme to Tackle Human-Tiger Conflict Outside Reserves June 27, 2025 Why in the News? The Union Environment Ministry has given approval for funding for the \u2018tigers outside of tiger reserve\u2019 pilot scheme to manage human-tiger conflicts better through enhanced monitoring and protection. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? About the Scheme (Need, Scope, Implementation, Causes for Human-Tiger Conflict, Institutional & Policy Framework, Govt Support, Future Outlook) Addressing the Challenge of Tigers Beyond Protected Areas In response to the rising incidence of human-tiger conflict in several parts of India, the Union Ministry of Environment has approved a pilot scheme focused on \u201ctigers outside of tiger reserves.\u201d This scheme, with an outlay of Rs. 88 crore until 2026-27 , aims to enhance the protection, monitoring, and conflict management capabilities in regions where tigers roam outside officially designated tiger reserves. The executive committee of the National Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) has given in-principle approval for a year of pilot implementation. This decision follows data-driven identification of forest divisions with high conflict zones, where ~30% of India\u2019s tiger population resides. Scope and Implementation of the Pilot Scheme Initially, 80 forest divisions across 10 states have been shortlisted for funding under the scheme . These divisions were identified based on the frequency and severity of human-tiger conflicts in recent years. Key objectives of the pilot scheme include: Strengthening monitoring systems through technology. Capacity building of forest staff to manage conflict. Partnering with civil society organisations and expert veterinarians. Supporting prey base augmentation to reduce livestock predation. The scheme will be implemented at the ground level by the Chief Wildlife Wardens of state forest departments in collaboration with the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA). The NTCA is currently finalising the list of eligible divisions and has been asked to submit revised, year-wise financial estimates before final approval by the CAMPA governing body. Underlying Causes of Human-Tiger Conflict Tigers outside designated reserves often inhabit agricultural landscapes or forest fringes near human settlements. These areas lack the dedicated protection mechanisms available within official tiger reserves. Being apex predators and territorial in nature, tigers often push other predators like leopards into human spaces, escalating conflict risk. Notably, some of the major conflict hotspots include: Chandrapur near Tadoba Tiger Reserve, Maharashtra Sugarcane fields around Dudhwa and Pilibhit, Uttar Pradesh Forest divisions near Ranthambore, Rajasthan Wayanad, Kerala Between 2020 and 2024, 382 people were killed in tiger-related incidents, with 111 deaths recorded in 2022 alone . These numbers underscore the urgent need for proactive and well-resourced intervention outside traditional protected zones. Institutional and Policy Framework The pilot scheme is financially backed by the National CAMPA, which manages the Compensatory Afforestation Fund . This fund consists of payments collected in lieu of forest land diverted for non-forest purposes and has been used in the past for wildlife initiatives such as the Great Indian Bustard recovery and Project Cheetah . CAMPA\u2019s involvement ensures the utilisation of existing funds for a cause directly linked to forest and wildlife sustainability. The National Board for Wildlife , chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had earlier discussed this scheme during its meeting in March 2025. Government Support and Future Outlook Speaking at the India Conservation Conference held at the Wildlife Institute of India, Union Environment Minister reaffirmed the government\u2019s commitment to tackling man-animal conflict. Citing personal visits to conflict-prone areas like Dudhwa and Kabini, he acknowledged the complexity of managing tiger populations that venture outside reserves. The minister emphasised the importance of adopting a region-specific approach, recognising that the dynamics of conflict and coexistence differ significantly between forest types and human settlements. newspaper.pdf ( Size: 756.9 KB ) Latest Article See All IndiGo Meltdown Dec. 5, 2025, 2:34 p.m. Economics India to Expand Its Busiest Rail Corridors: What\u2019s Planned Dec. 5, 2025, 2:08 p.m. Economics Census 2027 - Counting India, Renewing the Republic Dec. 5, 2025, 1:54 p.m. Editorial Analysis Health and National Security Cess on Demerit Goods Dec. 5, 2025, 1:48 p.m. Economics A Missing Link in India\u2019s Mineral Mission Dec. 5, 2025, 1:33 p.m. Editorial Analysis A Day to Pause and Come Down to Earth Dec. 5, 2025, 1:27 p.m. Editorial Analysis Rupee Breaches the 90-Mark Dec. 4, 2025, 1:36 p.m. Economics Putin\u2019s Visit: India\u2013Russia Ties and the Road Ahead Dec. 4, 2025, 1:24 p.m. Interna", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

ECI\u2019s Crackdown on Unrecognised Political Parties: Delisting 345 Defaulters from Political Registry June 30, 2025 Why in the News? The Election Commission of India (ECI) has initiated steps to de-list 345 Registered Unrecognised Political Parties (RUPPs). What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? About RUPPs (Overview, Reasons Behind Their Delisting, Legal Framework, Financial Implications, Reforms, etc.) Overview of Registered Unrecognised Political Parties (RUPPs) RUPPs are associations registered with the Election Commission of India (ECI) under Section 29A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 . These parties are distinct from recognised national or state parties as they have not secured a sufficient vote share or seats in previous elections. Despite not having official recognition, RUPPs enjoy certain benefits: Tax exemption under Section 13A of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Eligibility for common poll symbols during elections. Permission to nominate up to 20 \u2018star campaigners\u2019 for canvassing. They are, however, required to: Contest elections periodically. File annual audit accounts and contribution reports. Disclose donations exceeding Rs. 20,000, and ensure that no donations above Rs. 2,000 are accepted in cash. Reasons Behind the Election Commission Delisting 345 RUPPs The Election Commission has initiated the process of delisting 345 RUPPs that have: Not contested even a single election in the last six years. Failed to maintain physical offices at their registered addresses. Ignored statutory filing requirements, including financial disclosures. This is part of a broader clean-up initiated by the ECI, which began identifying and acting against \u201cnon-functional\u201d parties as early as 2022. Since then, 284 RUPPs have been delisted and 253 declared inactive for failing to comply. The latest batch of 345 brings this drive to a sharper focus, particularly with upcoming elections in view. The Election Commission has tasked the Chief Electoral Officers (CEOs) of the respective States and UTs to issue show-cause notices to these parties before delisting. Final decisions will be made based on the CEO\u2019s recommendations. Legal Framework and Loopholes The right to form a political association is protected under Article 19(1)(c) of the Constitution. Registration is governed by Section 29A of the RP Act, 1951 , which does not grant ECI explicit power to de-register a political party once registered, except in cases of fraud or violation of constitutional allegiance. This legal vacuum means that while the ECI can delist or declare parties inactive (affecting their privileges), it cannot de-register them outright. The Supreme Court , in Indian National Congress vs Institute of Social Welfare (2002), affirmed this interpretation. Thus, ECI\u2019s current action is limited to delisting RUPPs from the list of parties eligible for benefits , not erasing them as legal entities. Financial Implications and Risks Many of these parties were found to be: Availing 100% tax exemptions despite non-compliance. Operating as shell entities or even engaging in money laundering activities. Selling nominations by fielding dummy candidates to extract withdrawal payments from major parties. By delisting such entities, the ECI aims to block misuse of public trust and state-sanctioned benefits. Reforms Needed and Way Forward The Law Commission , in its 255th report (2015) , recommended empowering the ECI to de-register parties that fail to contest elections for 10 consecutive years. The ECI echoed this in its 2016 electoral reform memorandum . Additionally, the lack of inner-party democracy remains an unresolved concern. Many RUPPs, and even some recognised parties, operate without periodic internal elections or transparency in leadership appointments. The 170th and 255th Law Commission Reports called for specific amendments to the RP Act to instil internal democracy. Policy Recommendations: Amend the RP Act to explicitly allow de-registration for non-contesting or non-compliant parties. Mandate inner-party democracy through legal provisions. Establish independent auditing of party finances, possibly under a public accounting body. newspaper.pdf ( Size: 292.3 KB ) Latest Article See All IndiGo Meltdown Dec. 5, 2025, 2:34 p.m. Economics India to Expand Its Busiest Rail Corridors: What\u2019s Planned Dec. 5, 2025, 2:08 p.m. Economics Census 2027 - Counting India, Renewing the Republic Dec. 5, 2025, 1:54 p.m. Editorial Analysis Health and National Security Cess on Demerit Goods Dec. 5, 2025, 1:48 p.m. Economics A Missing Link in India\u2019s Mineral Mission Dec. 5, 2025, 1:33 p.m. Editorial Analysis A Day to Pause and Come Down to Earth Dec. 5, 2025, 1:27 p.m. Editorial Analysis Rupee Breaches the 90-Mark Dec. 4, 2025, 1:36 p.m. Economics Putin\u2019s Visit: India\u2013Russia Ties and the Road Ahead Dec. 4, 2025, 1:24 p.m. International Relations Judiciary Flags Major Lapses in Critical Care for Acid Attack Survivors Dec. 4, 202", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

Jostling for Primacy: India\u2019s China Challenge in the Indian Ocean June 29, 2025 Why in News? The Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs has flagged the growing presence of extra-regional powers in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) as a major strategic challenge, especially China\u2019s expanding footprint. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Significance of the Indian Ocean Chinese Advances in the Indian Ocean Key Highlights of the Report India\u2019s Response: Regional Partnerships and Sensitisation Significance of the Indian Ocean Since the early 2000s, the Indian Ocean's significance has resurged , becoming a critical zone in global security and economic dynamics . Rise of Regional Economies and Trade Networks The emergence of new economies, especially India and China, has increased the Indian Ocean\u2019s role in global trade and connectivity, turning it into a central hub of commerce. Maritime Security and Piracy Threats The rise of piracy off the Somali coast highlighted vulnerabilities in Sea Lines of Communication (SLOCs), prompting enhanced maritime security efforts across the region. Indo-Pacific as the New Geostrategic Construct The Indo-Pacific framework, which links the Indian and Pacific Oceans, has elevated the Indian Ocean\u2019s strategic value, positioning it as a central axis in the evolving global order. Chinese Advances in the Indian Ocean Unlike its overt assertiveness in the South China Sea, China has adopted a long-term, calculated approach in the Indian Ocean, gradually enhancing its footprint through economic, political, and maritime initiatives. Strategic Port Infrastructure and Political Engagement China is expanding its influence in the IOR by: Strengthening political and economic ties with littoral states like Sri Lanka, Maldives, and Bangladesh. Investing in dual-use port infrastructure across the region. Surveillance via Research Vessels China has been deploying research and survey vessels in the Indian Ocean, docking them in countries like Sri Lanka and Maldives. These vessels are believed to support underwater surveillance and data gathering, posing a potential security threat to India\u2019s maritime interests. Launch of the China-Indian Ocean Forum In 2022, China initiated the China-Indian Ocean Forum, aiming to take the lead in regional governance and multilateral cooperation. India\u2019s notable absence from the forum highlights a growing geopolitical divergence in the region. Key Highlights of the Report The Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs identifies the increasing involvement of extra-regional players, especially China, as a major strategic challenge for India in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). Dual-Use Infrastructure and Surveillance Expansion China is developing ports, airports, and logistics hubs for dual-use purposes. It is also deploying survey and research vessels to gather sensitive maritime and oceanographic data, boosting its maritime domain awareness. Naval Power Projection and Military Base in Djibouti Since establishing a military base in Djibouti (2017), China has expanded its naval presence, increasing both the number of vessels and the duration of deployments across the IOR. Strategic Assets Near India\u2019s Maritime Boundary China is actively building dual-use infrastructure in IOR littoral states, including areas near India\u2019s maritime boundary, aiming to support logistical functions and assert maritime dominance. India\u2019s Response: Regional Partnerships and Sensitisation India is working with partner nations in the IOR to raise awareness about China's long-term strategic intentions and the security implications of its expanding footprint. Assurance from Sri Lanka In December 2024, Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake reiterated that Sri Lanka would not allow its territory to be used against India\u2019s security or regional stability. India\u2019s Stand on BRI and the CPEC India maintains a principled opposition to China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Projecting Leadership in Maritime Security India is emerging as a first responder and preferred security partner in the IOR, particularly in: Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) Developmental aid PM Modi\u2019s launch of the MAHASAGAR doctrine (Mutual and Holistic Advancement for Security and Growth for All in the Region) redefines India\u2019s regional vision.

Fathoming America\u2019s Plan to Manage AI Proliferation June 27, 2025 Context The United States has withdrawn its AI export control plan called the Framework for AI Diffusion. This move is seen as positive. The framework was considered harmful to AI growth and global relations. However, new developments show that AI controls will still continue, but in different ways. AI Diffusion Framework In its final days, the Biden administration introduced the AI Diffusion Framework, treating AI like nuclear technology. It imposed export controls and licenses, favoring allies and restricting adversaries like China and Russia. Rationale Behind the Framework The U.S. believed that computational power drives AI strength. To maintain its edge, it aimed to limit adversaries\u2019 access to powerful compute while centralizing AI development within allied nations. Counterproductive Impact of the Framework While trying to tighten controls, the Framework unintentionally harmed global cooperation, even among allies. It prompted partners to seek independence from the U.S. tech ecosystem, undermining trust and collaboration. Mischaracterization of AI as Military Tech AI is primarily a civilian technology with military applications, unlike nuclear tech. Treating it as a defense tool restricted innovation, which is international and collaborative by nature. Innovation Driven by Restriction Tight controls encouraged alternative innovations. China\u2019s DeepSeek R1 is a result of such restrictions, achieving top-tier AI performance with less compute, reducing the effectiveness of export controls. Revocation and the Road Ahead The Trump administration revoked the framework due to its flaws. This benefits countries like India, which were disadvantaged. However, the U.S. approach to controlling AI diffusion, especially towards China, is expected to continue in new forms. The Possible Replacement Continued Efforts Despite Framework Withdrawal Although the AI Diffusion Framework has been rescinded, the U.S. continues to tighten controls on Chinese access to AI chips. Expansion of Export Controls In March 2025, the U.S. broadened export restrictions and added more companies to its blacklist, reinforcing efforts to limit AI chip access. Hardware-Based Monitoring Measures The administration is considering new on-chip features to monitor and restrict AI chip usage, targeting functionality and specific applications. New U.S. legislation proposes built-in location tracking in AI chips to prevent their diversion to countries like China and Russia. Shift from Trade to Technological Enforcement Rather than relying solely on trade restrictions, the U.S. now aims to achieve the framework\u2019s goals through technological controls embedded in AI hardware. Emerging Concerns with New Control Measures Technologically enforced AI controls raise issues of ownership, privacy, and surveillance. These measures may deter legitimate users while failing to stop malicious actors. Undermining Trust and Autonomy Such controls reduce user autonomy and create trust deficits. Nations\u2014even allies\u2014may fear losing strategic autonomy and seek alternatives to U.S.-based AI systems. Tactical Shift, Not Strategic Change The withdrawal of the AI Diffusion Framework reflects a tactical adjustment, not a change in the core U.S. strategy to control AI proliferation. Risk of Repeating Past Mistakes If technologically-driven controls are fully adopted, they could reproduce the same harmful outcomes as the rescinded framework, weakening global trust in U.S. leadership. Conclusion: A Missed Opportunity for Strategic Reflection Persisting with control-based policies signals that the U.S. has not fully absorbed the lessons of the Framework\u2019s failure, potentially undermining its global AI leadership.

In recent months, India\u2019s poverty statistics have gained attention. In April 2025, the government cited a World Bank report claiming 171 million people were lifted out of extreme poverty over a decade. Later, the World Bank updated its poverty estimates, stating that only 5.75% of Indians now live in abject poverty, down from 27% in 2011\u201312. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Poverty Line Reasons Behind India Using the World Bank\u2019s Poverty Line to Estimate Poverty About World Bank\u2019s poverty line Key Takeaways from the Latest World Bank Data on Poverty in India India\u2019s Own Domestic Poverty Lines Poverty in India: A Matter of Perspective Poverty Line A poverty line is the income threshold used to determine who is considered poor in a given economy. The poverty line varies with time and location. Income sufficient in 1975 may be inadequate today, and lifestyles differ across regions. There is no universal poverty line. Different benchmarks can be set based on context and purpose, allowing for more accurate analysis. Reasons Behind India Using the World Bank\u2019s Poverty Line to Estimate Poverty India\u2019s last recognised poverty line was based on the 2009 Tendulkar Committee formula, using 2011\u201312 data . In 2014, the Rangarajan Committee proposed a new method, but it was never formally adopted . Due to data gaps and outdated methods, India now relies on NITI Aayog\u2019s Multidimensional Poverty Index or the World Bank\u2019s poverty line. In the absence of updated national metrics , the World Bank\u2019s poverty line is increasingly used to estimate poverty trends in India. About World Bank\u2019s Poverty Line The World Bank\u2019s poverty line reflects the cost of basic living, adjusted to each country\u2019s purchasing power parity (PPP) , to allow fair comparisons. Origins of the $1-a-Day Benchmark In 1990, researchers used PPP exchange rates to compare national poverty lines of the poorest countries, establishing the first global standard: $1/day (1985 prices). Adjustment for Inflation and Global Context As global prices rose, the World Bank updated its poverty line\u2014most recently raising it to $3/day in June 2025. At the 2025 PPP rate (\u20b920.6/USD), India\u2019s extreme poverty line equals \u20b962/day. For comparison, the PPP rate is 0.67 for the UK and 3.45 for China. Key Takeaways from the Latest World Bank Data on Poverty in India There are few takeaways from the latest World Bank data shown on poverty in India. Revised Historical Poverty Estimates The World Bank\u2019s latest data shows India\u2019s past poverty levels were overestimated. For example, 1977-78 poverty was 47%, not 64%. New Poverty Line: $3 Per Day (PPP) The World Bank adopted a new poverty line of $3/day (PPP-adjusted). Using this, India\u2019s poverty fell from 27% in 2011\u201312 to under 6% in 2022\u201323. Sharp Reduction in Extreme Poverty India\u2019s extreme poor declined from about 34.4 crore in 2011\u201312 to 7.5 crore in 2022\u201323 \u2014 a significant improvement. Misconceptions About the Poverty Line A common mistake is converting $3 using the market rate (\u20b985/USD). Instead, PPP conversion applies \u2014 approximately \u20b920.6 per dollar \u2014 reflecting actual purchasing power. The $3/day poverty line is not a direct cash figure but reflects what $3 can buy in India, adjusted for local costs. India\u2019s Own Domestic Poverty Lines Pre-Tendulkar (2009): \u20b917/day (urban), \u20b912/day (rural) Tendulkar Committee (2009): Raised to \u20b929/day (urban), \u20b922/day (rural) Updated for 2011\u201312 : \u20b936/day (urban), \u20b930/day (rural) Rangarajan Committee (2014): Recommended \u20b947/day (urban), \u20b933/day (rural) Poverty in India: A Matter of Perspective Despite India\u2019s history of poverty research, defining who is poor varies widely. Estimates range from 5.75% to 66%, depending on the benchmark used. Multiple Measures, Conflicting Realities 5.75% live below the World Bank\u2019s $3/day (\u20b962) poverty line. 24% is the poverty benchmark for lower middle-income countries. 20% voluntarily offer labour for minimal wages. 66% receive free food under government schemes. These diverse indicators present a conflicting picture of poverty. Policy vs Reality: Income Tax Benchmark The 2024 Union Budget waived tax for those earning up to \u20b912 lakh/year (\u20b93,288/day), contrasting sharply with the \u20b962/day poverty line \u2014 highlighting the vast income spectrum. Two Ways to Interpret WB Data First, celebrate the reduction in extreme poverty. Second, reflect on broader economic hardship, as 83% of Indians live on just \u20b9171/day \u2014 a figure that includes total income or expenditure. The Bigger Question: What Truly Defines Poverty? The variation in definitions and data prompts a deeper inquiry into India\u2019s actual economic well-being and whether poverty is being accurately understood or just statistically managed.

India refused to endorse the joint declaration at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Defence Ministers\u2019 meeting in China, objecting to the omission of references to terrorism. As the current SCO chair, Beijing hosted the 2025 defence ministers' meeting in Qingdao. According to the MEA, India had strongly pushed for including terrorism concerns, but one country blocked the consensus, leading to the exclusion and India\u2019s decision to withhold endorsement. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) India Refuses to Sign SCO Draft Statement India\u2019s Refusal to Sign SCO Draft Statement - Analysis Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) SCO is a regional bloc of 10 countries: India, China, Russia, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Iran, and Belarus. It is the world\u2019s largest regional organisation by area and population. Origins and Formation The SCO evolved from the \u201cShanghai Five\u201d (1996), formed by China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan to address post-Soviet security concerns, including religious extremism and ethnic tensions. It was formally established on June 15, 2001, in Shanghai. Focus on Regional Security Unlike most global organisations, the SCO focuses on security cooperation among Asian nations. It addresses challenges like terrorism, separatism, and extremism. RATS \u2013 The Security Arm The SCO\u2019s Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS) is its key security mechanism. It facilitates intelligence sharing and coordination among member states through regular meetings and exchanges. India Refuses to Sign SCO Draft Statement At the 2025 SCO Defence Ministers\u2019 meeting, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh refused to sign the joint statement. This was after the joint statement excluded any mention of the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack but included a reference to the Jaffar Express hijacking in Balochistan . India\u2019s Objection: Terrorism Omitted According to MEA, India had pushed to include references to terrorism, particularly Operation Sindoor and the Pahalgam attack, but \u201cone particular country\u201d objected\u2014a veiled reference to Pakistan. As consensus was required, the statement was not adopted. India Highlights Pahalgam Attack and Operation Sindoor In his speech, Indian Defence Minister strongly condemned the Pahalgam terror attack, where victims were targeted based on religious identity. He named The Resistance Front, a proxy of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), as responsible. He described India\u2019s retaliatory Operation Sindoor as a demonstration of its zero tolerance for terrorism. No Tolerance for Double Standards India asserted that peace cannot coexist with terrorism or WMD proliferation. It called for: Decisive global action against terror sponsors Consequences for countries enabling cross-border terrorism An end to SCO\u2019s silence on state-sponsored terror India\u2019s Refusal to Sign SCO Draft Statement \u2013 Analysis SCO, traditionally dominated by Russia and China, now sees China playing a more dominant role due to Russia\u2019s preoccupation with the Ukraine war . China-Pakistan Nexus at Play China, a staunch ally of Pakistan, has extended military and diplomatic support to Islamabad following India\u2019s Operation Sindoor. It has consistently shielded Pakistan in global forums from criticism over terrorism. India\u2019s Refusal \u2013 A Strategic Signal Rajnath Singh\u2019s refusal to sign the SCO draft document, which ignored the Pahalgam terror attack but mentioned the Balochistan train hijacking, sent a strong diplomatic message. As a result, no joint statement was issued at this year\u2019s meeting. Reaffirming India\u2019s Stance on Terrorism India reiterated its \"no compromise on terrorism\" doctrine. Indian Minister\u2019s action reflects New Delhi\u2019s consistent position that terrorism and normal diplomatic engagement cannot coexist. What Lies Ahead All eyes are now on the upcoming SCO Council of Heads of State meeting in Tianjin this autumn. India\u2019s stance may influence future regional discourse on terrorism and security cooperation.

A Year Later \u2014 Colonial-Era Laws to New Criminal Codes June 30, 2025 Context In 2023, the Government of India undertook a sweeping reform of its colonial-era criminal laws by introducing three new criminal laws. One year into their implementation, the early outcomes of these legislative changes are beginning to take shape, particularly in the realm of policing and investigation. After a year, now it becomes imperative to critically examine the new criminal laws' implementation, highlight technological innovations , evaluate progress, and underscore continuing challenges. Key Features of New Criminal Codes Legislative Overhaul and Structural Transition The central government's legislative reforms marked a significant departure from colonial jurisprudence , attempting to modernize the administration of criminal justice. As part of this process, the transition to the new codes has largely been smooth , thanks in part to digital platforms like the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) , a backbone of the Inter-operable Criminal Justice System (ICJS) . The CCTNS has enabled jurisdictional routing of zero FIRs and streamlined police operations across states. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) deserves credit for overseeing this crucial phase of systemic transformation at the ground level. Technological Integration through \u2018e-Sakshya\u2019 The hallmark of this reform has been the e-Sakshya mobile application , developed by the National Informatics Centre (NIC) in collaboration with the MHA. This app allows real-time recording and preservation of evidence , such as photographs and videos, embedded with geo-coordinates and time stamps . It complies with several mandatory provisions under the BNSS, including Sections 105, 173, 176, 180, 185, and 497, all of which emphasize the digital documentation of searches, seizures, statements, and property disposal. Feedback from Investigating Officers (IOs) has been encouraging. The app has introduced greater accountability , prevented delegation of investigation tasks to unauthorised personnel, and increased the credibility of the evidence by visibly involving witnesses at crime scenes. Mandatory selfies and digital footprints left by IOs help ensure responsibility and eliminate ambiguities. Strengthening Forensic Practices Another critical reform is the mandatory visit of a Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) expert to crime scenes, as per Section 176 of the BNSS. Despite limited growth in forensic infrastructure, this mandate ensures scientific rigor in crime scene analysis. The government has responded with plans for institutions like the National Forensic Science University (NFSU) and a Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) in Raipur, which could address current deficiencies. An Overview of Operational Challenges and Gaps Implementation of E-Sakshya Courts have not yet integrated with the ICJS to directly access evidence from the National Government Cloud (NGC) . As a result, IOs must still resort to submitting pen drives manually, adding to costs and redundancy. The dependence on personal mobile phones for official tasks has been problematic. The app requires Android 10+ devices with at least 1 GB storage , compelling IOs to upgrade at their own expense. Limited tablets provided to police stations are insufficient to meet operational demand. There are also software limitations. In non-linked FIR scenarios, only five Sakshya IDs can be generated offline, and image or video errors cannot be rectified in linked cases. These constraints may undermine the app\u2019s utility in critical situations. Reluctance from accused persons to be digitally recorded while revealing crime details has emerged as another barrier, although such documentation could significantly boost conviction rates. Legal Ambiguities and Incomplete Digitization Section 303 of the BNS does not clearly define when thefts under \u20b95000 are to be treated as cognizable offences, while Section 112 on organised petty offences remains overly broad. Furthermore, provisions such as video-conferencing for witness examination under Section 530 of the BNSS are underutilised , despite being legally permissible. Although the seven-day limit for forwarding medical examination reports of rape survivors has been successfully implemented, post-mortem reports continue to be delayed. The MedLEaPR system , still under testing in Chhattisgarh , promises to streamline this process by digitally linking hospitals with police systems. The Way Forward: Feedback and Resource Allocation For the reforms to succeed fully, feedback loops from IOs, courts, and state governments must be institutionalised. An ongoing review mechanism should be established to revise ambiguous provisions, address legal loopholes, and simplify procedural bottlenecks. Moreover, the allocation of additional resources to forensic units, IT infrastructure, and training programs is urgently required.

India is preparing legislative changes to two major laws in its atomic energy sector to attract private and foreign investment. Amendments to the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act, 2010 (CLNDA) aim to ease liability provisions, addressing long-standing investor concerns. Another key reform would allow private companies to operate nuclear power plants , potentially enabling foreign firms to hold minority stakes in future projects. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? India Plans Major Changes to Nuclear Liability Law Opening the Nuclear Sector to Private Participation U.S. Clears Regulatory Hurdle for Nuclear Cooperation Conclusion India Plans Major Changes to Nuclear Liability Law The government is working on amendments to the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act, 2010 (CLNDA) to address concerns that have deterred foreign and domestic investment in the nuclear sector. Foreign Vendor Concerns Over \u2018Right of Recourse\u2019 Section 17(b) of the CLNDA gives nuclear plant operators the right of recourse against suppliers in case of defects in equipment or services . This provision has been flagged by companies like Westinghouse Electric (U.S.) and Framatome (France) as a major barrier due to fears of future liability. Broad Definition of \u2018Supplier\u2019 Worrying for Indian Sub-Vendors The current definition of \"supplier\" is considered too broad, with no distinction between primary suppliers and sub-vendors . Indian equipment manufacturers have expressed concern that they too may be held liable, creating uncertainty and reluctance to participate. Proposed Amendments to Align with Global Norms Two key amendments are being considered: Diluting Section 17(b) to bring it in line with international nuclear liability standards. Clarifying the definition of 'supplier' to exclude smaller sub-vendors unless specifically mentioned in contracts. Possible Caps on Vendor Liability Deliberations are also underway to limit the liability of vendors: Monetary cap pegged to the original contract value Time-bound applicability of liability This is expected to reassure both foreign and domestic suppliers. Regulatory Oversight as a Safeguard All nuclear projects must be vetted by the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB), which can ensure that contractual clauses for recourse are properly defined, maintaining safety and accountability. Move to Align Nuclear Liability Law with Global Norms Amendments to the CLNDA aim to align India\u2019s liability framework with the 1997 Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (CSC). India became a party to the CSC in 2016 , and the current legal tweaks would bring its national law in closer conformity with international standards. Opening the Nuclear Sector to Private Participation The government is planning a major amendment to the Atomic Energy Act, 1962 to allow private companies to operate nuclear power plants\u2014an activity currently reserved for state-owned entities like NPCIL and NTPC. The proposed reform could also enable foreign companies to take minority equity stakes in upcoming nuclear projects, paving the way for greater global collaboration in India's atomic energy sector. A Historic Shift in a Traditionally Closed Sector India\u2019s atomic energy sector has remained closed to private and foreign players. These legislative reforms mark a transformational shift aimed at unlocking its commercial potential. Nearly two decades after the Indo-US civil nuclear agreement, the amendments are seen as a way to revive and capitalize on its unrealized potential, strengthening bilateral strategic and commercial ties. The nuclear sector reforms are also being positioned as part of a larger trade and investment framework with the U.S., possibly leading up to a formal trade pact currently under negotiation. U.S. Clears Regulatory Hurdle for Nuclear Cooperation In March 2025, the U.S. Department of Energy granted a \u201810 CFR part 810\u2019 specific authorisation to Holtec International. This clearance allows: Transfer of unclassified small modular reactor (SMR) technology to India Collaboration with Holtec Asia, Tata Consulting Engineers, and L&T Earlier, this regulation barred U.S. firms from manufacturing or designing nuclear components in India, which had stalled cooperation. The responsibility now lies with India to enact the two key legislative amendments to unlock the full potential of the Indo\u2013U.S. civil nuclear deal and expand its domestic nuclear energy capacity. Conclusion Experts underscore the economic necessity of these amendments to attract foreign vendors and enable domestic manufacturing in the nuclear sector. With global legal alignment, domestic clarity on liability, and U.S. cooperation now secured, passing these reforms could finally activate the long-awaited civil nuclear partnership and bolster India's energy security and industrial capability .

India's Giant Leap - Human Spaceflight and the Expanding Horizon of ISRO June 27, 2025 Context: The participation of Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla in the Axiom-4 mission to the International Space Station ( ISS ) marks a historic moment in India's space journey. It represents the dawn of India's human spaceflight era and signals a strategic leap in ISRO's ambitions and global collaborations. The Milestone Moment - Shubhanshu Shukla at the ISS: A symbol of a new era: Shubhanshu Shukla\u2019s presence aboard the ISS is symbolic not just of individual achievement but of a national milestone in space exploration . Though not part of an indigenous mission, this represents the operational beginning of India\u2019s human spaceflight programme. More than a first flight: His journey is not an isolated feat but a strategic stepping stone towards ISRO\u2019s Gaganyaan mission , India\u2019s first crewed space mission, now scheduled for 2027 . Strategic Importance of the Axiom-4 Participation: Bridging the gap to Gaganyaan: Originally selected for the Indian crewed mission, Shubhanshu Shukla\u2019s participation in Axiom-4 allows ISRO to gain first-hand exposure to launch operations and astronautics. It helps India refine protocols, safety procedures, and training modules . International collaborations and learning: ISRO sent a team to assist in launch operations , emphasizing India\u2019s active and competent role in global space ventures. Global Context - Human Spaceflight Capability: India joins the big league: Only three countries\u2014 USA, Russia, and China \u2014have independent human spaceflight capability. India is on course to become the fourth , bolstered by increasing cooperation with global agencies like NASA. Strategic autonomy in space: Without this capability, India would remain dependent on foreign platforms for critical space research and missions. Human spaceflight is essential for planetary exploration , especially for Moon and Mars missions. Evolving Space Ecosystem and India\u2019s Role: Rise of the private sector and LEO activity: The Lower Earth Orbit ( LEO ), ranging from 200\u20132,000 km altitude, is increasingly crowded with commercial satellites. Private players, especially from the US, are driving innovation, allowing national agencies to shift focus to deep space missions. India\u2019s vision beyond the ISS: The ISS , a model of international cooperation, is slated for decommissioning by 2030. India, not a part of the current ISS consortium, plans to launch its own space station by 2035 \u2014possibly becoming a critical player in the next global space platform. Technological and Institutional Developments: Setting up indigenous astronaut training infrastructure: Shubhanshu Shukla and others received astronaut training in Russia and NASA , exposing India\u2019s lack of domestic facilities . Their experience paves the way for India to establish its own astronaut training centre , with potential to serve other countries commercially. Boost to R&D and strategic capabilities: Human spaceflight and space stations enable microgravity experiments , vital for scientific progress. India\u2019s inclusion in future multinational space missions will provide priority access to space-based research. Space Diplomacy, Global Partnerships and Geopolitical Implications: ISRO\u2019s growing stature has led to enhanced India-US cooperation , seen in India\u2019s role in Axiom-4. Human spaceflight capability gives India bargaining power in future multilateral collaborations in space. Conclusion: Shubhanshu Shukla\u2019s flight is more than a symbolic success \u2014it\u2019s the launchpad of a new era in Indian space exploration. As India sets sights on the Moon, Mars, and its own space station, human spaceflight capability is emerging as a strategic asset , enabling scientific advancement, national prestige, and global collaboration. This event marks a significant inflection point in India's transformation from a space-faring nation to a space-power .

{"id": "753db0e9-1d9a-48c3-834b-cbd80a7b8c9d", "text": "Home / Mains Articles / GPS Interference Threa... GPS Interference Threatening Flights, Ships June 30, 2025 Why in News? Recent incidents\u2014including a Delhi-Jammu flight turning back, a tanker collision at the Strait of Hormuz, and a container ship grounding near Jeddah\u2014were all caused by GPS interference, which has now become a major threat to global aviation and maritime navigation. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? About GPS Interference Dangers Associated with GPS Interference Multiple Causes of GPS Interference How Aircraft Mitigate GPS Interference How Ships Handle GPS Spoofing Conclusion About GPS Interference GPS interference refers to deliberate cyber-attacks that disrupt or deceive Global Positioning System (GPS) signals, affecting navigation for aircraft, ships, and other vehicles. Types of GPS Interference GPS Jamming Involves the use of a jammer device that emits strong radio signals on GPS frequencies. These signals overpower the weaker satellite signals , causing GPS receivers to lose location and time data . This is a form of signal disruption . GPS Spoofing Uses a device to transmit false signals that mimic those from GPS satellites. It deceives receivers into accepting incorrect location or time data. Unlike jamming, spoofing doesn\u2019t block signals\u2014it manipulates them . While often used interchangeably, jamming disrupts GPS functionality , whereas spoofing misleads the receiver. Both pose serious threats to navigation and safety in air and sea operations. Dangers Associated with GPS Interference GPS interference poses a serious threat to both civilian and military operations, enabling remote disruption without physical confrontation. In 2024, there were reports of up to 700 GPS spoofing incidents daily worldwide, underlining the scale and urgency of the threat. Risks to Aviation and Maritime Safety Spoofing can mislead pilots, causing incorrect position judgments and increasing the risk of collisions with terrain or other aircraft. For ships, loss of GPS accuracy can lead to groundings, collisions, and disruption of maritime operations, including port functions. GPS spoofing isn\u2019t limited to air and sea\u2014it can also disrupt road navigation, leading to traffic jams and paralyzing transport systems, particularly during emergencies. Impact on Critical Infrastructure Air traffic control, port operations, and vessel traffic systems (VTS) are highly dependent on GPS. Interference can cause systemic failures in these sectors, with wide-ranging safety and operational consequences. Multiple Causes of GPS Interference GPS interference can arise from both natural and intentional sources, including: Electromagnetic radiation from nearby devices Ionospheric disturbances and solar flares Deliberate jamming and spoofing in conflict zones Countries with advanced electronic warfare capabilities\u2014especially those involved in active conflicts\u2014are often responsible for intentional interference. While military in intent, civilian vessels and aircraft nearby can also be affected. Hotspots of GPS Interference Persian Gulf and Red Sea Maritime GPS interference has surged due to regional tensions. Windward\u2019s Q1 2025 data shows a 350% increase in spoofing in the Red Sea compared to 2024. Vessels reported sudden jumps of hundreds of nautical miles. Eastern Europe Ongoing Russia\u2013Ukraine war has led to frequent GPS spoofing incidents, especially affecting airspace safety. How Aircraft Mitigate GPS Interference Use of Backup Navigation Systems Inertial Navigation Systems (INS): Uses gyroscopes and accelerometers to calculate position from the last known location. VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) and Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) : Ground-based radio navigation aids that help pilots cross-check their position. Other Navigation Techniques Dead reckoning and celestial navigation are rare but can be used in extreme cases. Dead reckoning - the process of calculating one\u2019s position by estimating the direction and distance travelled Instrument Landing Systems (ILS) remain unaffected by spoofing and ensure safe landings. Crew Training and Communication DGCA mandates enhanced crew training to identify and respond to spoofing threats. Pilots are encouraged to monitor control room chatter for early warning signs. How Ships Handle GPS Spoofing Manual Navigation During Spoofing Ships typically operate on autopilot using GPS, but spoofing forces a switch to manual helm control. Terrestrial navigation using lighthouses, radars, and paper charts ensures continued situational awareness. Adoption of Multi-GNSS Systems Ships increasingly rely on multi-constellation Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), which includes: U.S. GPS Russia\u2019s GLONASS EU\u2019s Galileo China\u2019s Bei Dou This diversification reduces dependency on a single system and enhances resilience. Conclusion Mitigating GPS interference involves a multi-layered approach: Redundant systems in aircraft Manual navigation and GNSS diversification in ships National autonomy through indige", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

India\u2019s coastline has increased by nearly 50%, not due to territorial expansion but because of more accurate recent measurements. The number of offshore islands has also risen slightly following a reassessment and recount. While these changes hold administrative and strategic significance, they do not reflect any actual change on the ground. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? India\u2019s Coastline Now Measures 11,098 km The Coastline Paradox: Why Lengths Keep Changing Island Counting: A Different Challenge India\u2019s Coastline Now Measures 11,098 km India\u2019s coastline has increased from 7,516 km to 11,098 km, a rise of 3,582 km (nearly 48%). This change is due to improved measurement techniques, not territorial expansion. From Low to High-Resolution Mapping The previous measurement used low-resolution data (scale 1:4,500,000), which missed fine land features. The new measurement used high-resolution data (scale 1:250,000), capturing more bends, curves, and irregularities, thereby increasing the measured length. How Scale Affects Measurement Using a smaller-scale \u201cruler\u201d (low resolution) smoothens out intricate details, showing straight lines where bends exist. High-resolution tools now map minute variations more precisely, thanks to modern GIS software, replacing older manual methods. Inclusion of Offshore Islands Another contributor to the increase is the inclusion of many previously uncounted offshore islands , which were either invisible in older data or missed due to manual limitations. Significance Though the actual land has not changed, the updated coastline data holds strategic and administrative value, improving mapping accuracy and planning for coastal development and security. The Coastline Paradox: Why Lengths Keep Changing India\u2019s new coastline measurement is more accurate but still not definitive. This is due to the coastline paradox, which states that irregular natural features like coastlines have no fixed length, as the measured length increases with finer resolution. Precision Changes Everything The more detailed the measurement (higher resolution), the longer the coastline appears. Advancements in mapping technologies, such as GIS, lead to greater precision and thus a longer calculated length. The Paradox Beyond Coastlines The coastline paradox applies to other natural features too, like river networks and mountain ranges. For instance, river banks are irregular, but river lengths are typically calculated along the main stream, avoiding the same variability. Periodic Reassessment Now a Norm Due to evolving technology and natural processes (like erosion and land reclamation), India has decided to recalculate its coastline every 10 years. This aligns with practices in other countries to maintain updated and precise coastal data. Implications The changing length has administrative, environmental, and strategic relevance, even if it doesn\u2019t reflect a change in physical territory. It emphasizes the importance of continuous monitoring and adaptive planning. Island Counting: A Different Challenge Unlike coastlines, island counts don\u2019t face measurement paradoxes, but they do suffer from classification ambiguities\u2014such as whether a landmass submerged at high tide qualifies as an island. Previous Discrepancies in Island Numbers In 2016, the Surveyor General of India listed 1,382 offshore islands, while state agencies, Coast Guard, and Navy reported a lower count of 1,334. The difference arose due to varying definitions and criteria. Standardisation and Updated Island Count A data reconciliation and standardisation exercise resolved these discrepancies. The final count is: 1,298 offshore islands 91 inshore islands Total: 1,389 islands This count excludes river islands like those in Assam and West Bengal. Why It Matters Standardising island counts has administrative, security, and environmental implications, especially for maritime boundaries, disaster planning, and coastal development.

Caste Enumeration in India\u2019s 2027 Census: Rethinking Data Collection for Inclusive Policy June 26, 2025 Why in the News? The Central Government has announced that the next Census would take place in 2027 and that it would collect information on castes. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Upcoming Census (Introduction, Timelines, Process, Significance, Limitations, Suggestions, Way Forward) Introduction India is preparing to conduct its next decennial Census in 2027, with a significant change: the inclusion of caste enumeration. This marks the first such effort since 1941 and aims to provide data that could help bring marginalised communities into the policy mainstream. However, experts and statisticians argue that to fulfil this ambitious goal, a fundamental restructuring of the current Census design and methodology is essential. Timeline and Process of the Upcoming Census The Census will be conducted in two key phases: House-listing Phase (2026): Scheduled between April and September 2026, this phase will record data about dwelling units and household amenities. Population Enumeration Phase (2027): This phase will collect demographic, social, and economic data, including caste-related information. Caste enumeration will occur during the second phase, which represents a marked departure from earlier Censuses that did not record comprehensive caste data, except for Scheduled Castes (SCs). Significance of Caste Enumeration India last attempted caste enumeration in the 1941 Census, but the data was never processed due to the outbreak of World War II. The last usable caste data, therefore, dates back to 1931, making it grossly outdated for modern policy use. The Union government, led by PM Modi, has justified this inclusion as a measure to integrate marginalised communities and enhance targeted policymaking. However, questions remain whether the current Census framework can deliver on this promise without substantive changes. Limitations of the Existing Census Framework The current format of the Census questionnaire, based on the 2021 draft, only gathers caste data for SCs . To make caste enumeration meaningful, experts argue the need to collect data for all castes (excluding Scheduled Tribes), accompanied by adjustments in enumerator training, software tools, and data processing protocols. Moreover, key socio-economic indicators like employment, education, age at marriage, and place of birth are currently not cross-tabulated effectively with caste information. Existing questions on unemployment, migration, and childbirth suffer from conceptual ambiguity and low data quality, reducing their usefulness for caste-based policy analysis. Suggested Reforms for Enhanced Data Collection Linking Household Data with Demographic Information One major reform proposed is the integration of housing and asset-related questions from the house-listing phase into the population enumeration phase. This change would: Reduce data linkage errors arising from a 6-9 month time gap between phases. Enable accurate correlation between caste and access to housing, electricity, and sanitation. Improve coverage in urban areas, which often suffer from higher omission rates. Making the Questionnaire Leaner Several questions have become outdated or redundant due to rapid social and technological change. These include: Ownership of mobile phones or computers. Household access to bank accounts. Streamlining the questionnaire would allow enumerators to focus on collecting accurate responses to more impactful variables. Ensuring the Utility of Collected Data Despite the Census providing caste-wise data for socio-economic variables for decades, such data has rarely informed the identification of Most Backward Castes (MBCs) or shaped welfare schemes beyond reservation frameworks. For caste enumeration to be genuinely transformative, the data must be analysed and integrated into broader public policy processes. Challenges in Collecting Caste Data While Census data can be a vital tool, it also faces logistical and methodological hurdles, such as: Self-identification inconsistencies across castes and sub-castes. Lack of standardised caste lists. Enumerator biases and recording errors. Nevertheless, in the absence of any other large-scale, uniform data source, the Census remains the most feasible mechanism to gather caste-wise socio-economic data across India. Way Forward To ensure the 2027 Census lives up to its potential, policymakers must: Redesign the questionnaire to capture more granular and relevant data. Improve enumerator training and digital tools for data collection. Integrate caste data with other critical indicators such as literacy, employment, housing, and migration. Commit to using the data beyond reservation quotas for broader social and economic reforms. If executed thoughtfully, this exercise could provide India with a rich dataset for evidence-based policymaking aimed at inclusive development", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

India\u2019s New Urban Worry \u2014Rising Overnutrition May 28, 2025 Context While historically battling undernutrition and infectious diseases, India is now facing a silent but severe epidemic, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) driven by lifestyle-related factors. Recent data from Hyderabad\u2019s IT sector, where 84% of employees were found to have Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Fatty Liver Disease (MAFLD), underscores the rapid and alarming rise of NCDs, particularly among urban working populations. Therefore, it is important to explore the multifaceted dimensions of India\u2019s nutrition-related health crisis, its socioeconomic and occupational drivers , and the urgent need for comprehensive regulatory reform. The Paradox of Malnutrition in India India is experiencing a paradoxical nutritional landscape , where undernutrition and overnutrition coexist. While significant parts of the country still battle hunger and nutrient deficiencies, urban centres are witnessing a surge in obesity and related metabolic disorders. According to the World Health Organisation, NCDs accounted for 74% of global deaths in 2019, with a disproportionate burden falling on low- and middle-income countries like India. In 2021, India ranked second globally in obesity prevalence, reflecting a troubling shift in public health trends. This dual burden is starkly evident in the Global Hunger Index, where India\u2019s low ranking reveals that economic growth has not translated into equitable nutritional outcomes. Particularly in technology-driven metropolitan areas such as Hyderabad and Bengaluru, professionals are increasingly tethered to sedentary routines , high-stress environments, and diets dominated by ultra-processed, nutritionally poor foods. Multifaceted Dimensions of India\u2019s Nutrition-Related Health Crisis Urbanisation, Occupational Hazards, and Lifestyle Shifts The transformation of urban India into a global technological hub has come with unintended health consequences. The IT industry , emblematic of India\u2019s economic rise, exemplifies this shift. Employees are often subject to irregular work hours, insufficient sleep, and easy access to calorie-rich, nutrient-poor food in office kiosks, contributing to the high prevalence of obesity and metabolic disorders. This occupational hazard is not limited to IT professionals. National-level surveys indicate that the prevalence of overweight and obesity increases with both age and income. Among men aged 40 to 49, the obesity rate rises to 32%, and among the wealthiest quintile, to 37%. These trends extend across gender and urban-rural divides , with higher NCD prevalence reported in urban areas, particularly among those aged 18 to 59, the most economically productive age group. Public Health Indicators and the Failure of Preventive Care Despite some improvements in healthcare access and diagnosis , preventive and treatment outcomes for NCDs remain dismal. The STEPS Survey (2023\u201324) from Tamil Nadu, one of India\u2019s more developed states, paints a grim picture. While workplace interventions like the Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam programme have screened hundreds of thousands, actual disease control remains poor. Among hypertensive individuals, only 16% have controlled blood pressure; among young diabetics, fewer than 10% achieve glycaemic control. Poor dietary habits and physical inactivity are widespread. Over 94% of Tamil Nadu respondents reported inadequate fruit and vegetable intake , while nearly one-fourth lacked sufficient physical activity. The availability of unhealthy food options and the proliferation of fast-food outlets in cities further exacerbate these trends. Regulatory Shortfalls and Consumer Awareness Although consumer awareness around nutrition is growing , it remains insufficient to combat an obesogenic environment shaped by aggressive marketing and inadequate food regulation . The Eat Right India movement, spearheaded by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), has made strides through certification programmes, hygiene ratings, and public awareness campaigns like Aaj Se Thoda Kam . However, these efforts lack enforcement strength and fail to reshape the food landscape meaningfully. Efforts to introduce tools such as the Health Star Rating (HSR) for packaged foods have met with criticism from medical and nutrition experts who question their effectiveness and scientific basis. Further complicating reform is the resistance from powerful food industry lobbies , which continue to prioritize profit over public health. The Way Forward Global Lessons: The Saudi Arabian Model India can learn from international best practices in tackling NCDs. Saudi Arabia\u2019s Vision 2030 initiative provides a compelling model. By integrating regulatory reform with civic engagement, the kingdom has implemented strong measures such as calorie labelling in restaurants , excise taxes on sugary beverages and energy drinks, and sodium limits in processed foods", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

India\u2019s Financial Sector Reforms Need a Shake-Up May 29, 2025 Context India\u2019s financial sector stands at a critical juncture , where incremental reforms have yielded limited results in the face of deep-seated structural inefficiencies. Despite efforts by the government and regulators, the financial ecosystem, spanning banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI), continues to grapple with fundamental frictions that deter savings, discourage investment, and delay economic growth. To unlock its full potential, India needs not just more reform, but smarter, systemic restructuring focused on transparency, efficiency, and inclusivity. Key Areas Requiring Urgent Attention Inconsistent Nomination Frameworks: Legal Ambiguity and Public Inconvenience One of the most glaring inefficiencies in India\u2019s financial architecture lies in the disjointed and confusing nomination rules across the BFSI domain. A single citizen encounters different nomination regimes for bank accounts, mutual funds, and insurance policies, ranging from singular to multiple nominees with varying rights and legal standings. This inconsistency not only bewilders consumers but also fuels legal disputes and facilitates exploitation through litigation. The absence of a harmonised nomination framework results in significant ambiguity regarding the nominee\u2019s legal authority versus the rights of legal heirs. There is little justification for maintaining three separate systems, and unless the government can present compelling evidence to support such a setup, the status quo appears to serve no public interest. A unified, transparent framework that clarifies these roles would reduce legal confusion and enhance consumer protection. India\u2019s Shallow Corporate Bond Market: A Missed Economic Opportunity India\u2019s corporate bond market remains underdeveloped, illiquid, and opaque despite numerous policy initiatives over the years. This shortfall is economically significant. A robust bond market would lower the cost of capital by 2% to 3%, making businesses more viable and spurring job creation. However, efforts to build this market, such as the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s directive to the National Stock Exchange (NSE) to develop a secondary bond platform, have seen minimal follow-through, largely due to a preference for more lucrative equity trading practices, often enabled by algorithmic strategies. The opacity of these operations undermines financial integrity and accountability. When journalists exposed malpractices at the NSE, the institution responded with a defamation suit rather than corrective action, a response later criticized by the High Court. Such episodes highlight the need for greater regulatory transparency and accountability in capital markets, particularly in light of India\u2019s global obligations as a member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Ultimate Beneficial Ownership (UBO) Disclosure: Loopholes and Regulatory Evasion A key concern in capital market transparency is the inadequate disclosure of Ultimate Beneficial Ownership (UBO). Although India adheres to FATF norms, current thresholds, 10% for companies and 15% for partnerships, allow entities to structure investments just below these levels, thereby skirting disclosure requirements. This loophole was evident in the case of two Mauritius-based foreign portfolio investors, Elara India Opportunities Fund and Vespera Fund, who resisted multiple regulatory requests for shareholder data. Opaque ownership structures hinder effective regulatory oversight and threaten the long-term integrity of India\u2019s markets. Without accurate and accessible UBO data , regulators are unable to determine who truly controls or benefits from specific financial transactions. To restore trust and attract sustainable investment, India must tighten disclosure norms and enhance enforcement capabilities. Some Other Areas of Concern Retirement Planning: A High-Cost System in Need of Innovation India\u2019s current approach to retirement planning disproportionately relies on annuity-based products offered by insurance companies, which are expensive due to intermediation costs. These fees, although seemingly small (typically around 2%), accumulate significantly over time, eroding returns for savers. A compelling alternative lies in long-dated, zero-coupon government securities, low-cost, sovereign-backed instruments already supported by existing technology. These products eliminate the need for costly intermediation and provide a straightforward solution for long-term savings. Despite the clear advantages, both the government and the RBI have been slow to act. By overlooking these instruments, India is missing a crucial opportunity to build a sustainable, efficient retirement ecosystem for its growing working population.

This comes amid Trump\u2019s second administration\u2019s renewed engagement with Pakistan and aggressive push for US crypto leadership . Pakistan-WLFI Crypto Collaboration: MoU and strategic goals: MoU signed between WLFI and the newly formed Pakistan Crypto Council . Key stakeholders involved: PM Shehbaz Sharif, Army Chief Asim Munir, and WLFI delegation. Objectives of the MoU: Use blockchain for financial inclusion . Monetise untapped national assets like rare earth minerals. Introduce stablecoins for trade and remittances . Position Pakistan as a regional crypto hub . Concerns and viability: Pakistan\u2019s fragile economy raises questions about execution. Potential misuse of cryptocurrencies for terror financing and money laundering remains a concern, particularly for India. Trump\u2019s Second Term Crypto Agenda: Shift in US policy: Trump reversed earlier crypto scepticism (and promised to dismantle the Biden-era hostility toward the sector) and gained industry support. Within days of re-election: Executive order 1: Established National Blockchain Innovation Strategy. Banned CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency). Formed President\u2019s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, led by David Sacks (White House\u2019s \u201cAI and crypto czar\u201d). Executive order 2: Created Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and US Digital Asset Stockpile. Consolidated seized assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana. Aimed to preserve US dollar dominance through stablecoins. Key appointments and market response: Notable pro-crypto appointments: Elon Musk , David Sacks. Regulatory rollback: Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) paused lawsuits, Justice department disbanded crypto team. Market impact: Bitcoin surged beyond $100,000 recently (from $74,000 in March 2025). Trump launched the meme coin \" $TRUMP \", making himself a direct stakeholder. Pakistan\u2019s Crypto U-turn: Rise of domestic ecosystem: Until 2024 , Pakistan had banned or restricted crypto use. In 2025: Appointed Bilal bin Saqib to lead Pakistan Crypto Council. Saqib became Special Adviser to PM to build crypto regulations. Pakistan may have up to 25 million crypto users and a market worth $2 billion . Leveraging diaspora influence: Diaspora strategy modeled on India\u2019s Pravasi Bharatiya Divas . Aims to connect with Pakistani-American tech entrepreneurs . Diaspora convention used to reaffirm Pakistan\u2019s ideological and strategic identity. Strategic Implications for India: Security and technological threats: Analogous to India\u2019s past underestimation of Pakistan\u2019s nuclear ambitions. Risks of terror financing, cross-border laundering via crypto remain high. India\u2019s policy vacuum: India has over 100 million crypto users , and a $7 billion crypto market . Yet, there is no clear regulatory or strategic framework . Supreme Court intervention in Shailesh Bhatt case highlighted: Taxing crypto without regulation is legally inconsistent. Warned of economic and national security risks. Conclusion - India\u2019s Strategic Imperative: The rise of Trump\u2019s crypto diplomacy and Pakistan\u2019s digital realignment demand urgent Indian policy introspection. India must develop a comprehensive national crypto strategy ; evaluate security, economic, and geopolitical dimensions; and avoid repeating the mistakes of strategic neglect.

Mumbai experienced an unusually early and intense monsoon, arriving two weeks ahead of schedule and disrupting daily life with waterlogging, traffic jams, and delayed trains. According to IMD records since 1950, this is the earliest monsoon onset ever recorded in the city, breaking the previous record of May 29. The normal onset date is June 11. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) Factors Behind Mumbai's Earliest Monsoon Onset Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) MJO is an equatorial, eastward-moving system of anomalous rainfall and atmospheric circulation. It is planetary in scale and consists of alternating wet and dry phases, each lasting 30 to 60 days. It travels across the Indian and Pacific Oceans, sometimes reaching the Atlantic and re-entering the Indian Ocean. Behavior and Mechanism The MJO features enhanced convection and suppressed rainfall zones that move eastward at about 5 m/s (11 mph). It affects surface winds, upper-level divergence, and ocean-atmosphere interactions. The active phase is monitored using outgoing longwave radiation\u2014lower values indicate stronger convection (thunderstorms). Phases of the MJO The MJO has two main phases: Enhanced Rainfall (Convective) Phase Surface Winds Converge : Air is drawn in at the surface and rises. Rising Air Cools and Condenses : This leads to cloud formation and increased rainfall. Upper-Level Wind Divergence : Winds reverse direction at the top of the atmosphere. Suppressed Rainfall Phase Upper-Level Winds Converge : Air descends from higher altitudes. Descending Air Warms and Dries : Leads to dry conditions and reduced rainfall. Surface Winds Diverge : Air spreads out at the surface, inhibiting convection. Dipole Nature of MJO Strong MJO activity often divides the globe into two contrasting halves: One under enhanced convection and rainfall The other under suppressed convection and rainfall This dipole system moves eastward across the tropics , marking the progression of MJO. Criteria for Active MJO To be classified as active, the dipole must be: Clearly defined Propagating eastward over time Impact on Indian Monsoon The MJO significantly influences the timing, intensity, and breaks in the Indian monsoon. Stronger rainfall often occurs in India 5\u201310 days after warming of sea surface temperatures linked to the MJO. The break in monsoon , especially in July , is often caused when the MJO's active phase moves eastward away from the region. Impact on Tropical Cyclones MJO plays a role in tropical cyclogenesis by creating favorable or unfavorable large-scale conditions. Ascending motion enhances storm formation. Descending motion suppresses cyclone activity. The preferred cyclone region shifts from Western Pacific \u2192 Central Pacific \u2192 Atlantic as the MJO progresses. There's an inverse cyclone activity pattern between the North Pacific and North Atlantic , influenced by opposite MJO phases. Factors Behind Mumbai's Earliest Monsoon Onset Early Onset in Kerala The monsoon arrived in Kerala on May 24 \u2014 the earliest since 2009 \u2014 setting the stage for its rapid advancement. Typically, Mumbai receives monsoon around June 11, nearly 10 days after Kerala. Rapid Progression Unusually, the southwest monsoon travelled from Kerala to Maharashtra within just 24 hours, reaching Mumbai by May 27. Favourable Weather Conditions According to IMD, very favourable atmospheric conditions supported both the early onset and fast progression of the monsoon. Active Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) : A highly active MJO \u2014 a global system of wind and pressure patterns \u2014 was in Phase 4 with high amplitude, creating ideal conditions for enhanced rainfall and storm activity over India. MJO phase 4 represents a period of enhanced rainfall over the Indian Ocean and western Pacific, with a slight increase in rainfall over the southwest quarter of the globe, while other regions experience slightly below normal rainfall. Strong Cross-Equatorial Flow This flow, which transports moisture across the equator, was particularly strong, bringing in significant humidity needed to fuel monsoon clouds. Low Pressure in Arabian Sea A low-pressure area, formed due to cyclonic circulation, not only contributed to heavy pre-monsoon showers in Mumbai but also accelerated the monsoon\u2019s arrival.

Significance of Medium Enterprises in the MSME Ecosystem India\u2019s MSME sector, comprising Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises, contributes about 29% to the country\u2019s GDP and employs over 60% of its workforce. While micro enterprises make up 97% and small enterprises 2.7% of registered MSMEs, medium enterprises form only 0.3%. However, this small segment is responsible for nearly 40% of MSME exports, underlining its strategic importance in driving India\u2019s industrial competitiveness and export performance. Credit Challenges Faced by Medium Enterprises According to the NITI Aayog report titled \u201c Designing Policy for Medium Enterprises \u201d, the sector faces a credit gap of $10 billion (as of 2024), primarily due to structural and institutional barriers. Medium enterprises typically receive fewer priority sector loans than micro units and face borrowing costs that are approximately 4% higher than large corporations. Moreover, only 8 of the 18 MSME government schemes cater to medium enterprises, and just 17.81% of total funds are allocated to them. This has exacerbated funding constraints, leaving MEs without sufficient working capital support. NITI Aayog\u2019s Recommendations Dedicated Working Capital Financing Scheme NITI Aayog has suggested a sector-wise financing scheme based on enterprise turnover, with loans capped at \u20b925 crore, and a maximum of \u20b95 crore per individual request. The scheme would be managed by the Ministry of MSME and aim to provide timely and flexible funding for manufacturing and services units. Medium Enterprise Credit Card To address urgent liquidity needs such as payroll, inventory purchases, and equipment repair, a medium enterprise credit card facility with a \u20b95 crore limit has been proposed. The interest rates would align with market norms but include a grace period for repayment. Faster Fund Disbursal Through Retail Banks The report advocates the involvement of retail banks for quicker fund distribution, under the supervision of the MSME ministry. This would cut bureaucratic delays and ensure timely credit access. Broader Structural Issues Identified Apart from financial constraints, medium enterprises struggle with several non-financial challenges: Low adoption of advanced technologies Inadequate R&D support Lack of sector-specific testing infrastructure Mismatch between training programmes and actual enterprise needs These factors hinder scalability and innovation potential within the segment. Suggested Digital and Skilling Reforms To improve access to government resources, NITI Aayog recommends developing a dedicated sub-portal under the existing Udyam platform . This portal would include: Scheme discovery tools Compliance support AI-driven navigation assistance for enterprises Additionally, it calls for the integration of medium enterprise-specific modules into skilling and entrepreneurship training, aligned with regional and sectoral demands. Policy Outlook: Building a Supportive Ecosystem The report underscores that unlocking the potential of medium enterprises demands an inclusive and coordinated policy framework. Strategic interventions in financing, skilling, digital access, and infrastructure are essential to harness the segment\u2019s full capabilities. By enabling greater ease of doing business and removing systemic credit bottlenecks, India can position its medium enterprises as powerful drivers of export growth, employment, and self-reliance in the global economy.

A U.S. court ruled that President Donald Trump exceeded his authority by imposing tariffs on various countries under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The Court of International Trade stated that Trump's April 2 tariffs, announced on what he called \"Liberation Day,\" were not justified under the emergency law. The ruling also struck down earlier tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, concluding that the government misused the IEEPA to justify the trade measures. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? U.S. Court of International Trade (USCIT): Role and Standing Challenge to Trump's Tariffs under Emergency Law Court Ruling on Trump\u2019s Tariffs under IEEPA U.S. Court of International Trade (USCIT): Role and Standing The USCIT provides a dedicated judicial forum for civil cases related to import transactions and international trade. It ensures consistent and uniform interpretation of trade laws across the country. Jurisdiction and Authority Under the Customs Courts Act of 1980, the USCIT holds exclusive jurisdiction over civil actions against the United States, its officers, or agencies, arising from laws governing international trade. It can hear cases from any part of the country. Historical Evolution The court traces its roots to 1890, when Congress authorized the appointment of nine general appraisers to oversee merchandise valuation at key ports. Initially administrative, their role evolved over time into a judicial one, with progressively broader powers. Structure and Appointments The USCIT consists of nine judges, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. These judges serve lifetime tenures, reflecting the court\u2019s status as an Article III federal court. Challenge to Trump's Tariffs under Emergency Law Twelve US states (including New York, New Mexico, Connecticut and Arizona) challenged the tariffs, as did five small businesses. The court combined the two cases. Arguments by the States: Tariffs financially burdened state governments. Tariffs did not specifically target drug cartels, despite this being a stated justification. Core Legal Issue: Whether the President's use of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs exceeded the legal limits of emergency economic powers. Court\u2019s Focus: Determining the scope of presidential authority under the IEEPA. Assessing if the tariffs aligned with the intended use of emergency powers. Court Ruling on Trump\u2019s Tariffs under IEEPA The U.S. Court of International Trade examined whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977 grants the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs on goods from nearly every country. Court\u2019s Ruling The court held that IEEPA does not confer such unbounded authority, and therefore struck down the challenged tariffs. It concluded that Trump\u2019s actions exceeded the scope of authority delegated under the Act . IEEPA\u2019s Limitations and Historical Context The court noted that while the President\u2019s economic powers expanded during the World Wars and the Great Depression, IEEPA was enacted in 1977 to limit such powers. Under IEEPA, presidential powers can be exercised only to address \u201cunusual and extraordinary threats\u201d declared under a national emergency. Trump\u2019s Justification and Court\u2019s Rebuttal January 20 Emergency Declaration : Trump declared a national emergency under IEEPA citing threats from international cartels linked to drugs, gangs, and violence in the Western Hemisphere. Tariffs Imposed: 25% on goods from Mexico and Canada; 20% on goods from China. Court\u2019s Response : The court found that these tariffs did not directly address the declared threats, and thus, were unjustified under IEEPA. April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d Tariffs: Trump announced : A flat 10% baseline tariff on all countries; Retaliatory tariffs against specific trade partners. These were justified on grounds like trade imbalances, lack of reciprocity, and suppressed domestic wages. Court\u2019s Response : The court ruled these tariffs were also beyond the President\u2019s emergency powers, as they addressed broad economic concerns, not specific national emergencies as required under IEEPA. Legal Reference to Trade Act of 1974 The court highlighted that Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows limited tariffs to address balance-of-payment issues. This shows that tariffs must be imposed under narrower, clearly defined laws, not unconditionally under emergency powers. Next Steps Ordered by the Court The Trump administration must issue new orders reflecting the court\u2019s decision within 10 days. The administration has paused retaliatory tariffs for 90 days, but the 10% baseline tariff remains active. Appeal and Political Response The White House has appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. It may ultimately reach the Supreme Court.

India\u2019s Sodium-Ion Battery Push: A Strategic Shift Beyond Lithium May 29, 2025 Why in the News? A research team at the Bengaluru-based Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR) has developed a super-fast charging sodium-ion (Na-ion) battery that can charge up to 80 per cent in just six minutes. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Sodium-Ion Batteries (Introduction, Strategic Rationale, Innovation, Advantages, Disadvantages, Future Applications, etc.) Introduction With global concerns mounting over the limited availability and rising cost of lithium, India is taking bold strides toward developing sodium-ion battery (Na-ion) These efforts are part of a broader strategy to reduce reliance on lithium-ion batteries, an area where China commands a dominant position. Recent innovations from Indian institutions like the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR) and IIT Bombay are propelling sodium-ion technology into the spotlight as a feasible and scalable alternative. Strategic Rationale for Sodium-Ion Batteries Lithium-ion batteries have long been the backbone of energy storage in electric vehicles (EVs), portable electronics, and renewable energy grids. However, lithium\u2019s global supply chain is heavily concentrated and geopolitically sensitive, with China leading in both battery manufacturing and lithium refining. Given China's growing dominance, India\u2019s pivot to sodium-ion chemistry reflects both a strategic and technological imperative. Sodium, on the other hand, is more abundant and widely distributed. It can be extracted from seawater and poses fewer environmental hazards during storage and transportation. These characteristics make sodium a viable alternative to lithium, especially in a country like India with ambitions for energy security and technological self-reliance. Breakthrough Innovation by Indian Scientists In a major development, a team at Bengaluru-based JNCASR has developed a NASICON-type sodium-ion battery with significantly enhanced charging performance and lifespan . Unlike conventional Na-ion batteries that suffer from slow charge rates and shorter life cycles, this innovation enables up to 80% charge in just six minutes and supports over 3,000 charge cycles. The researchers achieved this performance by making critical modifications to the battery's anode material: Nanoparticle Engineering: Reducing particle size to the nanoscale. Carbon Wrapping: Encasing the particles in a thin carbon layer. Aluminum Doping: Incorporating small amounts of aluminum to enhance conductivity and ion mobility. These improvements not only accelerate the charging process but also reduce degradation risks, offering a safer and more reliable battery. Advantages and Limitations of Sodium-Ion Batteries Advantages: Resource Abundance: Sodium is far more available than lithium and can be extracted more sustainably. Cost-Effective Materials: Na-ion batteries use aluminium instead of copper, reducing production costs. Safety: Can be transported at zero volt, lowering fire hazards. Thermal Stability: Operate safely at a wider range of temperatures. Limitations: Lower Energy Density: Sodium-ion batteries currently offer less energy storage per unit weight compared to lithium-ion batteries. Design Rigidity: Cannot be moulded into various shapes like prismatic or cylindrical forms. Shorter Cycle Life: While improving, they still lag behind the 8,000+ cycles of lithium iron phosphate batteries. High Initial Costs: Limited commercial presence results in higher production costs at present. Future Applications and Outlook Despite current limitations, sodium-ion batteries hold immense promise for a wide range of applications, from electric two-wheelers and drones to solar-powered rural electrification systems. Their lower cost and safer handling characteristics make them particularly suitable for mass deployment in developing regions. The technology has already undergone validation using high-end electrochemical tests and quantum simulations. As efforts to scale up continue, India\u2019s bet on Na-ion batteries could position it as a leader in alternative battery chemistries, especially at a time when the world seeks safer, cleaner, and more equitable energy storage solutions.

Surge in Bank Fraud Value Despite Decline in Cases: RBI Data for FY25 May 30, 2025 Why in the News? According to RBI\u2019s Annual Report, bank frauds reduced in FY25 but the amount involved went up almost three-fold and most cases occurred in digital payments. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Bank Frauds (Nature & Sectoral Distribution of Frauds, Public vs Private Sector Trends, Legal Developments, etc.) Measures Taken (RBI\u2019s Measures, Govt\u2019s Measures, etc.) Significant Rise in Bank Fraud Amounts Amid Fewer Cases In a surprising trend, data from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) revealed that even as the number of reported bank fraud cases fell by over 34% in FY25, the monetary value involved surged nearly threefold. According to the RBI\u2019s Annual Report 2024-25 , the total amount involved in banking frauds rose from Rs. 12,230 crore in FY24 to Rs. 36,014 crore in FY25, an increase of 194%. The number of frauds dropped from 36,060 to 23,953 cases, suggesting enhanced detection or better internal control measures. However, this decrease in frequency was overshadowed by the steep rise in value, which exposed critical gaps in large-value transactions, especially in loan portfolios. Nature and Sectoral Distribution of Frauds Of the Rs. 36,014 crore frauds reported in FY25, nearly Rs. 33,148 crore, over 92%, were related to advances, indicating persistent vulnerabilities in banks\u2019 lending practices . These loan-related frauds often involve diversion of funds, overvaluation of collateral, and misrepresentation of financial statements by borrowers. In terms of number, the majority of cases were digital payment frauds involving cards and internet banking, totalling 13,516 cases. However, these only accounted for Rs. 520 crore of the total amount, indicating that although digital payment frauds are frequent, their value remains comparatively small. Public vs. Private Sector Bank Trends Private sector banks accounted for the majority (59.4%) of the total fraud cases , reporting 14,233 incidents. However, the maximum value of frauds was reported by public sector banks (PSBs), which accounted for Rs. 25,667 crore, or more than 71% of the total amount. This indicates that while private banks experience more frequent small-value frauds (mainly digital), PSBs continue to struggle with large-ticket loan frauds. The RBI observed that 122 old cases involving Rs. 18,674 crore were reclassified and reported afresh in FY25 after a Supreme Court judgment in March 2023 mandated stricter procedural compliance, leading to this statistical spike. Fraud Reporting Nuances and Legal Developments According to the RBI, frauds reported in a given year might have occurred in earlier years. The reported amounts do not necessarily represent final losses, as some sums may be recovered later. Moreover, a staggering Rs. 112,911 crore worth of 783 fraud cases were withdrawn by banks as of March 31, 2025, due to non-compliance with the principles of natural justice, as laid out by the Supreme Court. This legal correction emphasizes the necessity of procedural diligence and has implications for how fraud is reported and classified in banking. RBI\u2019s Strategic Measures to Mitigate Fraud Recognizing the gravity of the situation, the RBI has proposed multiple regulatory and supervisory interventions to mitigate fraud risks and improve operational resilience in the banking sector. Enhanced Supervisory Framework RBI plans to strengthen supervision of private banks and small finance banks. Special attention will be given to operational resilience, especially for digital services, to ensure they remain robust under stress. Liquidity Stress Testing To avert systemic crises, RBI is developing new cash-flow-based stress testing frameworks to assess the liquidity position of banks under extreme but plausible conditions. These tests aim to ensure that banks maintain adequate buffers and can meet obligations during crises. Digital Forensic Readiness and Monitoring RBI is working on a framework to monitor the uptime and resilience of digital banking services in near real time. A dynamic online dashboard for customers will be rolled out in phases, offering analytics and transparency on service quality. Fraud Risk Governance RBI is expected to tighten reporting mechanisms, requiring banks to adopt more robust internal controls, automated red flags for large advances, and regular audits for high-risk accounts. Government\u2019s Complementary Initiatives Alongside RBI, the Government of India has also taken steps to curb bank fraud: Central Fraud Registry (CFR): The CFR, a searchable online database, helps banks track fraud history across financial institutions before sanctioning new loans. Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, 2018: This allows for confiscation of assets of absconding defaulters like Nirav Modi and Vijay Mallya.

NITI Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam recently claimed that India has overtaken Japan to become the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, citing IMF data. This claim was met with both celebration and skepticism, with some insisting IMF data still places India fifth. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? India's Economic Ranking \u2013 Data, Debate, and Context Understanding Economic Rankings Through Nominal GDP and Purchasing Power Understanding Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) The Politics Behind GDP Rankings The Limits of Aggregate GDP Rankings \u2013 Why Per Capita Matters India's Economic Ranking \u2013 Data, Debate, and Context NITI Aayog CEO recently claimed India is now the fourth-largest economy, overtaking Japan. A More Surprising Claim: India Is Third Based on IMF data, another claim emerges \u2014 India has actually been the third-largest economy in the world since 2009, when it overtook Japan, during the govt under PM Manmohan Singh. Evidence The above figure displays India\u2019s GDP trajectory (dark green line) clearly separating from others in 2009. It also marks another pivotal shift in 2016, when China overtook the US to become the largest economy. Understanding Economic Rankings Through Nominal GDP and Purchasing Power Cost of Living vs. Nominal Income Two individuals earning similar salaries may not enjoy the same quality of life if one lives in a high-cost city like Mumbai and the other in a lower-cost city like Patna. This difference is due to the cost of living , which affects purchasing power and not just nominal income. Nominal GDP Nominal GDP is the total market value of all goods and services produced in a country, measured using current prices and converted into US dollars. This is the metric currently being used to claim India has overtaken Japan . Problems with Nominal GDP Comparisons Exchange Rate Sensitivity : Changes in the rupee-dollar or yen-dollar exchange rate can alter rankings without actual changes in economic output. Data Revisions : India's GDP figures often undergo revisions, making real-time comparisons less reliable. Lack of Cost Context : Nominal GDP ignores purchasing power and cost of living , which are essential for assessing real economic well-being. India\u2019s Current Position As per IMF data, India overtook the UK post-COVID in nominal GDP. However, it is still behind Japan and Germany as of the end of 2024. IMF projections show India overtaking both soon. Why Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) Matters Unlike nominal GDP, GDP by Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) adjusts for cost-of-living differences across countries. It provides a more accurate comparison of what people can actually buy with their incomes \u2014 making it a more meaningful metric of economic strength. While nominal GDP rankings create headlines, PPP-based GDP offers a more realistic picture of a nation\u2019s economic capacity and the standard of living of its citizens. Understanding Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) PPP is a method used to compare the economic productivity and standards of living between countries by accounting for the relative cost of living and inflation rates. It tells us how much actual goods and services one can buy in a country with its income, instead of relying on exchange rates alone . India\u2019s Global Ranking by PPP According to PPP-based GDP estimates, India became the third-largest economy in the world as early as 2009, not just recently \u2014 a fact often overlooked in public discussions. PPP gives a truer picture of a country\u2019s economic strength by adjusting for what money can actually buy. In PPP terms, India has been among the top economies for over a decade. The Politics Behind GDP Rankings India has made significant progress in nominal GDP terms , growing at an average rate of 6% to 7% since 2004 . This growth has helped India surpass major global economies in dollar-based rankings. Why Governments Prefer Nominal Rankings Governments often highlight nominal GDP milestones because: They\u2019re easier to communicate . They show recent progress . They help claim political credit . Why PPP-Based Rankings Are Ignored Even though India became the third-largest economy by PPP in 2009 , this ranking has remained unchanged. Since the relative position hasn\u2019t shifted , PPP metrics offer no fresh political advantage . Hence, they are rarely mentioned in political discourse , despite offering a truer economic picture . The Limits of Aggregate GDP Rankings \u2013 Why Per Capita Matters Since 2021, India\u2019s nominal GDP has been higher than the UK\u2019s in total terms. This is often used to highlight India\u2019s economic rise on the global stage. Per Capita GDP Tells a Different Story Despite India\u2019s higher total GDP: In 2021, UK\u2019s per capita GDP was $46,115 vs. India\u2019s $2,250. By 2025, UK\u2019s per capita GDP will be $54,949, while India\u2019s will only be $2,879. UK\u2019s per capita GDP remains nearly 19 times higher than India\u2019s.

Free Trade Agreements and Indian Agriculture: Prospects and Pitfalls May 28, 2025 Why in News? Between 2013-14 and 2024-25, India\u2019s agricultural exports grew modestly by just over 20%, rising from $43.3 billion to $51.9 billion. In contrast, agricultural imports surged by 148% during the same period, from $15.5 billion to a record $38.5 billion. This sharp rise in imports has led to India\u2019s farm trade surplus shrinking significantly\u2014from $27.7 billion to $13.4 billion. Notably, in 2024-25 alone, agri-exports rose 6.4%, outpacing the flat overall export growth, while farm imports jumped 17.2%, far above the 6.2% rise in total merchandise imports . These trends unfold as India negotiates FTAs with the US and EU, both of which are pushing for lower tariffs and greater access to Indian markets for their agricultural products. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Key Export Drivers Export Setbacks Interesting Case of Spices Major Agricultural Imports Trade Agreements and Future Implications Key Export Drivers Marine Products It is India\u2019s top farm export, but earnings declined from $8.1 billion in 2022\u201323 to $7.4 billion in the next two years. Major markets include the US (35%), China (20%), and EU (15%). Concern : US tariffs (17.7%) on frozen shrimp could rise further, affecting competitiveness. Rice Exports at Record Highs Combined basmati (6.1 mt) and non-basmati (14.1 mt) rice exports hit $12.5 billion in 2024\u201325. Markets: Basmati to West Asia; non-basmati to Africa. Growth in Other Segments Record-high exports of: Spices: Especially chilli, cumin, turmeric, mint, etc. Tobacco: Boosted by crop failures in Brazil and Zimbabwe. Coffee: Higher demand due to global shortage; India mainly exports robusta beans and powder. Fruits & Vegetables: Both fresh and processed saw growth. Export Setbacks Wheat and Sugar Exports peaked recently but are now restricted due to domestic shortages. Wheat peaked at $2.1 billion (2021\u201322). Sugar peaked at $5.8 billion (2022\u201323), with only white sugar exports continuing\u2014processed from imported raw sugar. Cotton Collapse India was once a major cotton exporter (over $4.3 billion in 2011\u201312), but exports have collapsed, turning India into a net importer. Buffalo Meat Recovered to $4 billion in 2024\u201325 but still below the 2013\u201315 levels of $4.4\u20134.8 billion. Interesting Case of Spices In 2024\u201325, India witnessed record highs in both spice exports and imports. While it remains a leading exporter of non-traditional spices like chilli, cumin, turmeric, mint products, oleoresins, and curry powders, it has become a net importer of traditional plantation spices\u2014pepper and cardamom. Major Agricultural Imports Vegetable Oils & Pulses Dominate Imports : India\u2019s top farm imports remain edible oils and pulses. Pulses imports reached a record $5.5 billion in 2024\u201325. Low yields and absence of MSP-backed procurement have deterred domestic expansion. Oilseed exports (mainly groundnut and sesame) and residual meal provide only partial offset. Rising Imports Due to Domestic Production Challenges Cotton Production has declined from 398 lakh bales (2013\u201314) to 291 lakh bales (2024\u201325), owing to stagnant yields and lack of innovation post-GM Bt hybrids. Natural Rubber Annual production averaged 8.5 lakh tonnes in recent years, down from 9\u20139.1 lakh tonnes a decade ago, while consumption has surged to 15 lakh tonnes. Other Notable Imports Fruits and Dry Fruits - Includes almonds, pistachios, walnuts, apples, dates, figs, and raisins. Spices - Mainly pepper and cardamom, which India now imports more of despite being a major spice exporter. Alcoholic Beverages - Imports of wines and spirits continue to grow, with potential for further rise under new trade deals. Trade Agreements and Future Implications The signing of trade agreements with the US, EU, and UK is expected to increase India\u2019s imports of dry fruits, wines, and spirits.

Nine-Month-Old Receives World's First Successful Base Editing Therapy May 27, 2025 Why in News? A nine-month-old boy, Kyle \u201cKJ\u201d Muldoon Jr., became the first known human to be successfully treated using custom base editing therapy , a precise form of gene editing. KJ suffers from CPS1 deficiency , a rare genetic disorder causing toxic ammonia buildup in blood. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Gene Editing Breakthrough CRISPR and its Mechanism Working of CRISPR-Cas9 Gene Editing Base Editing - The Next-Gen CRISPR Ethical, Economic and Regulatory Challenges Conclusion - Hope Amidst Challenges Gene Editing Breakthrough: What is the CPS1 deficiency? Carbamoyl Phosphate Synthetase I (CPS1) deficiency prevents the breakdown of nitrogen in the body, and leads to hyperammonemia , a potentially fatal condition. Treatment innovation: Scientists from the University of Pennsylvania and Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia used base editing , an advanced technique derived from CRISPR-Cas9 . CRISPR and its Mechanism: What is CRISPR? Stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR), it is an immune system found in microbes such as bacteria which fights invading viruses. When a virus infects a bacterial cell, CRISPR helps to establish a memory (a genetic one, not in the form of antibodies like in humans). When a virus enters a bacterial cell, the bacterium takes a piece of the virus\u2019s genome and inserts the DNA into its own genome. CRISPR then produces a new \u201cguide\u201d RNA , which directs an enzyme (a type of protein) called Cas9 to act like \u201cmolecular scissors\u201d to cut and eliminate the virus DNA. Development of CRISPR-Cas9 technology: Pioneered in 2012 by Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier, which earned them the Nobel Prize for Chemistry (2020). Working of CRISPR-Cas9 Gene Editing: The first task for the gene-editing tool is to identify the abnormal DNA sequence behind a patient\u2019s ailment. Once the bad DNA is located, scientists create a guide RNA attached to a Cas9 enzyme, which is then introduced to the target cells of the patient. The guide RNA recognises the bad DNA sequence , then the Cas9 enzyme cuts the DNA at the specified location in a process called a \u201c double-strand break \u201d (since the cut is made on both strands of the DNA). To prevent the regrowth of bad sequence , scientists also supply the correct DNA sequence after the \u201ccutting\u201d process which is meant to attach itself to the broken strands of DNA. Base Editing - The Next-Gen CRISPR: Key features: Base editing and CRISPR-Cas9 differ significantly in how they modify DNA. Unlike CRISPR-Cas9, base editing does not make a double-strand break . Rather, it enables targeted single-base conversions with the help of a Cas9 enzyme fused to a base-modifying enzyme. This allows scientists to fix mispairing of the bases by changing one specific base. Application in KJ\u2019s case: Specific mispaired base responsible for CPS1 was corrected. Advantages: Base editing system works like a pencil and eraser , unlike the scissors and glue of CRISPR, and doesn\u2019t require foreign DNA insertion . Precision, compact delivery, and fewer components. Easier to transport in viral vectors or other delivery systems. Ethical, Economic and Regulatory Challenges: Accessibility and cost: Prohibitively expensive - likely in hundreds of thousands of dollars. KJ\u2019s treatment is funded by research institutes and biotechnology firms. Scalability issues: Treatment was personalised; not applicable to other patients. Commercial disincentive for pharmaceutical companies due to high cost and customisation needs. Regulatory bottlenecks: Complex approval mechanisms, especially in countries like India. Need for reform in bioethics, policy, and governance Conclusion - Hope Amidst Challenges: KJ\u2019s case marks a milestone in personalised medicine. Despite its potential to revolutionise treatment of rare genetic diseases, base editing remains constrained by cost, customisation, and policy hurdles . Future success will depend on efforts to make advanced biotechnologies affordable, scalable, and ethically regulated. newspaper.pdf ( Size: 532.2 KB ) Latest Article See All IndiGo Meltdown Dec. 5, 2025, 2:34 p.m. Economics India to Expand Its Busiest Rail Corridors: What\u2019s Planned Dec. 5, 2025, 2:08 p.m. Economics Census 2027 - Counting India, Renewing the Republic Dec. 5, 2025, 1:54 p.m. Editorial Analysis Health and National Security Cess on Demerit Goods Dec. 5, 2025, 1:48 p.m. Economics A Missing Link in India\u2019s Mineral Mission Dec. 5, 2025, 1:33 p.m. Editorial Analysis A Day to Pause and Come Down to Earth Dec. 5, 2025, 1:27 p.m. Editorial Analysis Rupee Breaches the 90-Mark Dec. 4, 2025, 1:36 p.m. Economics Putin\u2019s Visit: India\u2013Russia Ties and the Road Ahead Dec. 4, 2025, 1:24 p.m. International Relations Judiciary Flags Major Lapses in Critical Care for Acid Attack Survivors Dec. 4, 2025, 1:13 p.m. Polity & Governance India\u2019s Seven-Point ", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

Government Tightens Norms for CSS and CS Schemes Continuation Post-2026 May 30, 2025 Why in News? As India gears up for the 16th Finance Commission cycle (from 1st April 2026 to 31st March 2031), the Union Government has mandated third-party evaluation as a precondition for the continuation of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) and Central Sector Schemes (CS) beyond March 31, 2026. There are 54 CSSs and 260 CSs which have their terminal date of approval till 31.03.2026 and are likely to be submitted for re-appraisal. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Current Evaluation Process Key Directives from the Ministry of Finance Timeline for Ministries Financial Allocations for 16th Finance Cycle About CSS and CS Conclusion Current Evaluation Process: NITI Aayog , the government\u2019s top think tank, is currently conducting evaluation of the CSSs. This exercise is to be completed shortly and the draft reports will be shared with the respective ministries and departments. Key Directives from the Ministry of Finance: No CSS or CS scheme will be appraised for continuation without third-party evaluation. Evaluation must reflect positive outcomes, justification of mandate, and performance-based necessity. Such exercise in the past had allowed the Central Government to enhance its capital expenditure substantially which now stands at Rs. 11.21 lakh crore for FY 2025-26 (BE). Timeline for Ministries: The ministries and departments have been asked to conduct evaluation studies of their schemes by the end of July this year . Get approval for continuation of schemes beyond March 31, 2026 from the Expenditure Finance Committee (EFC) before the start of the budget making process. Financial Allocations for 16th Finance Cycle: Allocation formula: Ministries will get allocations 5.5 times their average actual expenditure during 2021-22 to 2025-26. Requests for increased allocation: For example, the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare sought more funds for vaccination programs. Cabinet Secretary cautioned ministries against inflated projections, urging realistic budgeting. About CSS and CS: CSSs are programs funded mostly by the Union Government and implemented by State Governments. Examples : PM Poshan Scheme, PM Awas Yojana (Gramin). CSs , on the other hand, are fully funded and implemented by the Union Government. This means, they are executed directly through central ministries/departments. Examples : National Digital Health Mission, PLI Scheme. These schemes cover a wide gamut , from social sectors like health, women and child development, school and higher education, tribal welfare to agriculture sector, urban and rural infrastructure, environment, scientific research etc. While in case of CSs , the government of India bears 100% of the cost, in case of CSSs , the scheme expenditure is shared in a predefined ratio between the central and the state governments ( 60:40/75:25/90:10 ). Conclusion: The Government\u2019s insistence on rigorous third-party evaluations before the continuation of CSS and CS schemes marks a shift toward evidence-based policy and fiscal prudence . With the 16th Finance Commission's recommendations looming, ministries must align their priorities with realistic and performance-driven outcomes , making this a crucial development in India's public finance architecture. newspaper.pdf ( Size: 888.7 KB ) Latest Article See All IndiGo Meltdown Dec. 5, 2025, 2:34 p.m. Economics India to Expand Its Busiest Rail Corridors: What\u2019s Planned Dec. 5, 2025, 2:08 p.m. Economics Census 2027 - Counting India, Renewing the Republic Dec. 5, 2025, 1:54 p.m. Editorial Analysis Health and National Security Cess on Demerit Goods Dec. 5, 2025, 1:48 p.m. Economics A Missing Link in India\u2019s Mineral Mission Dec. 5, 2025, 1:33 p.m. Editorial Analysis A Day to Pause and Come Down to Earth Dec. 5, 2025, 1:27 p.m. Editorial Analysis Rupee Breaches the 90-Mark Dec. 4, 2025, 1:36 p.m. Economics Putin\u2019s Visit: India\u2013Russia Ties and the Road Ahead Dec. 4, 2025, 1:24 p.m. International Relations Judiciary Flags Major Lapses in Critical Care for Acid Attack Survivors Dec. 4, 2025, 1:13 p.m. Polity & Governance India\u2019s Seven-Point Energy Transition Agenda for 2035 Dec. 4, 2025, 1:05 p.m. Editorial Analysis", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

A new study conducted over Kolkata has revealed that the toxicity of PM2.5 air pollutants significantly increases after a certain concentration threshold is crossed, highlighting a sharper health hazard linked to rising pollution levels in Indian cities. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? About the Study Key Findings of the Study Why Toxicity Rises Sharply Beyond a Threshold Current Air Quality Standards: Concentration-Based Need for Toxicity-Based Air Quality Standards About the Study Title : Contrasting features of winter-time PM2.5 pollution and PM2.5-toxicity based on oxidative potential: A long-term (2016\u20132023) study over Kolkata megacity at eastern Indo-Gangetic Plain Published in : Science of the Total Environment, December 2024 Significance First-of-its-Kind in India : This is the first study to assess how PM2.5 toxicity varies with concentration levels in an Indian city. Public Health Implications : The findings call for urgent pollution control measures , especially in winter when PM2.5 levels peak. Policy Insight : Could guide threshold-based interventions and health advisories in Indian cities facing high air pollution. Key Findings of the Study Threshold Level Identified : The study found that PM2.5 toxicity sharply increases once the concentration exceeds 70 \u00b5g/m\u00b3. Peak Toxicity Range : The toxicity continues to rise until the concentration hits 130 \u00b5g/m\u00b3, after which it stabilises. No Safe Limit : Even at concentrations below 70 \u00b5g/m\u00b3, PM2.5 poses health risks, though less severe compared to higher levels. Variation Expected : Thresholds for a sharp rise in toxicity are likely to differ across cities. This is because pollution sources vary \u2014 for example, vehicular emissions might dominate in one city, while biomass burning could be a bigger factor in another. Why Toxicity Rises Sharply Beyond a Threshold At lower PM2.5 concentrations, the human body can manage the adverse effects of pollutants more effectively. However, beyond a certain threshold (~70 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 for Kolkata), the body\u2019s natural defence mechanisms become overwhelmed, leading to significantly greater cellular damage, especially in the respiratory system. Role of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Immune Response : When pollutants are inhaled, the immune system releases ROS to combat foreign particles. Double-Edged Sword : ROS can also harm healthy cells in the body. Antioxidants as Defenders : To counteract ROS, the body generates antioxidants, which neutralize ROS and protect cells. Oxidative Stress : When pollutant levels are high, ROS production exceeds the body\u2019s antioxidant capacity, leading to oxidative stress, which damages internal cells. Understanding Oxidative Stress and PM2.5 The sharp rise in oxidative stress at PM2.5 levels beyond 70 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 is mainly due to chemical components from biomass or solid waste burning . Vehicular emissions also contribute, but to a lesser extent compared to biomass burning. Need for Oxidative Stress-Based Standards While India has set air quality standards for PM2.5 and PM10, there are no benchmarks for toxicity or oxidative stress . This study aims to establish toxicity-based threshold values , helping cities adopt more health-focused pollution control policies. Current Air Quality Standards: Concentration-Based In India, air quality standards for PM2.5 are based only on concentration levels, not on how toxic the air is. Safe Limits Annual average: 40 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 Daily average: 60 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 Limitations of Concentration-Based Standards Health risks depend not just on how much PM2.5 is present, but also on its chemical composition and toxicity. The same concentration may be more harmful in one city than another, depending on the pollutant source (e.g., biomass burning vs. vehicular emissions). Why Toxicity Matters More In Kolkata, PM2.5 levels of 50\u201360 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 may not be significantly more harmful than 30\u201340 \u00b5g/m\u00b3. But toxicity spikes sharply after 70 \u00b5g/m\u00b3, indicating a real health emergency. Need for Toxicity-Based Air Quality Standards This study strengthens the case for incorporating toxicity thresholds into air quality norms. City-specific thresholds should be developed, reflecting local pollutant profiles. Such standards could help trigger early warnings or emergency actions when toxicity crosses a critical level, even if concentrations seem \u201cmoderate.\u201d Beyond AQI - Toxicity Key to Measuring Air Pollution.pdf ( Size: 1.2 MB ) Latest Article See All IndiGo Meltdown Dec. 5, 2025, 2:34 p.m. Economics India to Expand Its Busiest Rail Corridors: What\u2019s Planned Dec. 5, 2025, 2:08 p.m. Economics Census 2027 - Counting India, Renewing the Republic Dec. 5, 2025, 1:54 p.m. Editorial Analysis Health and National Security Cess on Demerit Goods Dec. 5, 2025, 1:48 p.m. Economics A Missing Link in India\u2019s Mineral Mission Dec. 5, 2025, 1:33 p.m. Editorial Analysis A Day to Pause and Come Down to Earth D", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

The Deputy Speaker's post has remained vacant for six years, raising concerns about constitutional compliance and democratic strength. In a parliamentary democracy, this role is not merely ceremonial but crucial for ensuring accountability, smooth functioning, and balanced power-sharing between the ruling party and the Opposition. The prolonged vacancy, reportedly due to the ruling government's reluctance to offer the position to an Opposition member, undermines the principle of power-sharing and democratic conventions, which hold significance even in the absence of explicit legal provisions. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Election and Tenure of the Deputy Speaker Powers, Functions, and Privileges of the Deputy Speaker Prolonged Vacancy of the Deputy Speaker Constitutional Implications of the Deputy Speaker's Vacancy Election and Tenure of the Deputy Speaker Under Article 93 of the Constitution, the Lok Sabha must elect a Speaker and Deputy Speaker from among its members \u201cas soon as may be,\u201d though no specific timeline is given. Article 94 ensures that the Deputy Speaker remains in office until resignation, removal, or disqualification, underlining the role's continuity. Election Process The date of the Deputy Speaker\u2019s election is fixed by the Speaker and communicated to members through a parliamentary bulletin. The election is conducted via a ballot paper vote. Tenure and Removal The Deputy Speaker remains in office until the dissolution of the Lok Sabha, unless removed earlier by a resolution passed by a majority of members. The position is also vacated if the Deputy Speaker ceases to be a Member of Parliament. If the Deputy Speaker\u2019s seat falls vacant, the members of the House may elect a new Deputy Speaker. Position in Order of Precedence In the official hierarchy, the Deputy Speaker ranks tenth, alongside the Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, Union Ministers of State, and members of the Planning Commission. Powers, Functions, and Privileges of the Deputy Speaker The Deputy Speaker assists the Speaker in managing the functioning of the Lok Sabha. In the Speaker's absence or when the post is vacant, the Deputy Speaker presides over proceedings and performs all associated duties. If nominated to any legislative committee, the Deputy Speaker automatically assumes the role of its chairman. Participation in Debates and Voting Unlike the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker can participate in debates and vote on matters as an ordinary member when the Speaker is presiding. When presiding over the House, the Deputy Speaker may only cast a vote in the event of a tie. Conventions and Financial Independence By convention, the Deputy Speaker, like the Speaker, does not sponsor Bills or resolutions, nor does he raise questions. His salary is drawn from the Consolidated Fund of India and is not subject to parliamentary approval. Constitutional Authority under Articles 95 and 96 Article 95 empowers the Deputy Speaker to maintain order, discipline, and adjourn proceedings in the Speaker\u2019s absence. Under Article 96, when a motion to remove the Deputy Speaker is under debate (with a 14-day advance notice), he cannot preside but is allowed to vote\u2014though not to cast the deciding vote in case of a tie. Parliamentary Convention While the Speaker is traditionally from the ruling party, the Deputy Speaker's post has conventionally been offered to a member of the Opposition. This informal practice aims to foster cooperation and maintain balance in the parliamentary process. Prolonged Vacancy of the Deputy Speaker Absence in Successive Lok Sabhas The Government did not appoint a Deputy Speaker during the 17th Lok Sabha (2019\u20132024), and indications suggest a similar approach for the 18th Lok Sabha. This ongoing vacancy reflects a failure to reach consensus between the ruling party and the Opposition, reportedly due to the government's reluctance to offer the post to the Opposition. Constitutional and Procedural Violations The prolonged vacancy undermines several constitutional provisions\u2014Articles 93, 94, and 180. Additionally, it violates Rule 8 of the Lok Sabha\u2019s Rules of Procedure (1952), which states that the election shall be held on a date fixed by the Speaker following a formal motion. Constitutional Implications of the Deputy Speaker's Vacancy Misinterpretation of Article 93 Although Article 93 mandates the election of a Deputy Speaker \u201cas soon as may be,\u201d the absence of a fixed timeline has led to prolonged delays. This undermines the constitutional intent and risks creating a constitutional vacuum. Erosion of Democratic Balance The Deputy Speaker\u2019s post is conventionally allotted to the Opposition to ensure power-sharing and uphold democratic values . Its continued vacancy centralizes authority in the Speaker\u2014typically from the ruling party\u2014thus disrupting the intended balance between the government and the Opposition.", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

The Silver Jubilee of a Strategic Partnership May 28, 2025 Context In 2025, India and Germany commemorate a milestone, 25 years of strategic partnership marked by mutual respect, shared goals, and comprehensive cooperation. This long-standing relationship, grounded in trust and common values, continues to evolve with the dynamic challenge s of the modern world. The partnership is deeply rooted in four fundamental pillars: peace, prosperity, people-to-people ties, and sustainable development. As the two nations celebrate this momentous occasion, it is clear that their collaboration is not only thriving but also poised for deeper engagement in the years ahead. Key Aspects of Indo-German Strategic Partnership A Shared Vision for Peace and Stability Peace and stability remain central to the Indo-German relationship. Both countries share a commitment to a rules-based international order and collaborate through a unique political framework, the Intergovernmental Consultations. This institutionalised dialogue develops a high degree of political trust and policy coordination. Strategic cooperation in the defence sector has flourished , exemplified by joint military exercises such as Tarang Shakti 2024 and naval port calls. These engagements not only strengthen operational coordination but also embed the Indo-Pacific more firmly in Germany\u2019s geostrategic consciousness. The future promises even closer collaboration in defence industries , highlighting a maturing and dependable bilateral relationship. Prosperity Beyond Economics Economic cooperation forms a significant aspect of the Indo-German relationship , yet their concept of prosperity transcends mere growth figures. Prosperity, as defined in this partnership, means creating meaningful employment , improving quality of life, and enabling human potential. Approximately 2,000 German companies operate in India, collectively providing employment to over 750,000 Indians. Initiatives like the Delhi-Meerut Rapid Rail , operated by Deutsche Bahn, symbolise high-tech collaboration and trust in shared capabilities. Furthermore, as global trade faces uncertainty, the resilience and integration of Indo-German supply chains underscore their mutual economic reliability. The prospect of an India-European Union Free Trade Agreement offers an exciting opportunity to elevate this cooperation. Joint research initiatives and technological collaboration further enrich this prosperity narrative, particularly in addressing environmental issues through innovation and entrepreneurial solutions. The Soul of the Indo-German Partnership: People-to-People Bonds Beyond formal ties, the human dimension of Indo-German relations breathes life into the partnership. The growing Indian diaspora in Germany, including over 50,000 students, now the largest group of foreign learners in the country , represents a vibrant bridge between the two nations. These students and professionals bring with them stories of adaptation, success, and cultural fusion, which deepen the bilateral relationship at a grassroots level. This human capital exchange is not one-sided. There is a growing need for more Germans to engage with India, to live, study, and work in the country. Enhancing mutual linguistic understanding is key to this effort. While Indians are increasingly learning German, efforts must also be made to encourage Germans to immerse themselves in India's diverse cultures and languages. Investments in future generations on both sides will ensure that the strategic partnership is sustained and strengthened over the next quarter-century. The Way Ahead: A Greener Future Together One of the most forward-looking aspects of the Indo-German partnership is their cooperation on environmental sustainability. Recognising the urgency of ecological preservation, Germany pledged \u20ac10 billion through the Indo-German Green and Sustainable Development Partnership (GSDP) in 2022. This cooperation spans renewable energy, biodiversity, and smart urban infrastructure. Notably, private sector involvement, such as the German technology used in Gujarat\u2019s expansive wind and solar projects, adds momentum to India\u2019s green transition. Germany's participation in India\u2019s clean energy ambitions is both strategic and symbolic, reflecting a shared responsibility for the planet\u2019s future. Conclusion The Indo-German strategic partnership stands as a testament to what sustained dialogue , mutual respect, and shared values can achieve. Over the past 25 years, this relationship has grown in scope and depth , adapting to new global realities while holding firm to foundational principles. With robust cooperation across defence, economy, education, culture, and sustainability, the partnership is well-positioned to address the challenges of the 21st century. As India and Germany look ahead, their bilateral ties serve not just as a model of diplomacy, but as a powerful force for global peace, prosperity", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}
{"id": "87393154-426d-4b63-9a2d-e6f115046c9e", "text": "Home / Mains Articles / Early Monsoon Onset in... Early Monsoon Onset in India This Year May 27, 2025 Why in News? The IMD declared monsoon onset over Kerala on May 24, eight days earlier than the normal June 1 schedule. This onset signals the start of the June\u2013September southwest monsoon, which delivers over 70% of India's annual rainfall, making it vital for agriculture and the economy. The last time the monsoon arrived this early was in 2009, on May 23. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Monsoon Onset Declaration: Criteria and Process Factors Behind Early Monsoon Onset in India Monsoon Onset Declaration: Criteria and Process The IMD attempts to declare the schedule for southwest monsoon onset any time after May 10. To do so, certain essential criteria are considered. Key Criteria for Onset Rainfall At least 60% of 14 designated southern meteorological stations (including Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi, Mangalore, etc.) must report \u22652.5 mm rainfall for two consecutive days. Wind Field Westerly winds must dominate up to 600 hPa pressure level. Wind speed at 925 hPa must range between 15\u201320 knots (27\u201337 km/h). Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) The Earth absorbs and reflects solar energy, affecting global temperature and climate. Aerosol particles in the atmosphere can absorb sunlight, contributing to atmospheric warming. The absorbed energy is re-emitted as longwave infrared radiation (OLR). OLR mainly originates from the warmed upper atmosphere, with some from the Earth's surface. This radiation helps warm the lower atmosphere, which in turn warms the Earth\u2019s surface. OLR values must be below 200 W/m\u00b2, indicating favorable atmospheric conditions for monsoon onset . IMD Declaration The monsoon onset is declared on the second day after all above conditions are met. This Year\u2019s Onset A simultaneous onset occurred over Kerala, Lakshadweep, Mahe (Puducherry), parts of the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, and southern Karnataka and Mizoram. Factors Behind Early Monsoon Onset in India The early onset of the southwest monsoon was driven by favourable atmospheric and oceanic conditions. A low-pressure area over the Arabian Sea and a trough over Vidarbha enhanced moisture inflow and atmospheric convection, accelerating the monsoon\u2019s advance. Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO): MJO is a significant and complex ocean-atmosphere phenomenon that originates in the Indian Ocean and plays a crucial role in influencing the Indian monsoon. It involves disturbances in clouds, winds, and pressure that move eastward at a speed of 4\u20138 metres per second. These disturbances, known as MJO wind bands, can circle the globe within 30 to 60 days and lead to major weather changes along their path. When the MJO is in a favourable phase, it can enhance rainfall over India during the monsoon season. Mascarene High The IMD describes the Mascarene High as a high-pressure area found around the Mascarene Islands (in the south Indian Ocean) during the monsoon period. The variation in the intensity of high pressure is responsible for heavy rains along India\u2019s west coast. Convection and Rainfall An increase in convective activity\u2014vertical movement of heat and moisture in the atmosphere\u2014can lead to rainfall. For example, a convective system over Haryana recently moved southeastward and caused rain in the Delhi region. Somali Jet and Monsoon Strength The Somali jet is a low-level, cross-equatorial wind system originating near Mauritius and north Madagascar . By May, it crosses the east coast of Africa and reaches the Arabian Sea and the west coast of India. A strong Somali jet enhances the monsoon winds, contributing to a robust monsoon. Heat-Low and Moisture Inflow With the Sun\u2019s shift to the northern hemisphere during summer, a low-pressure zone forms over the Arabian Sea. A heat-low over Pakistan and nearby regions acts like a suction pump, drawing moist air into the monsoon trough and intensifying monsoon rainfall. Monsoon Trough The monsoon trough is an elongated low-pressure area stretching from the heat low over northwest India to the north Bay of Bengal.

India\u2019s AMCA Stealth Jet Project Approved: A Leap Towards Indigenous Air Power May 28, 2025 Why in the News? Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has approved the execution model for the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft Programme. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? About AMCA (Background, Features, Capabilities, Significance, Global Comparison, Challenges, etc.) Indigenous Fifth-Generation Fighter Project Gets Green Light In a strategic boost to India\u2019s self-reliant defence vision, the Ministry of Defence has approved the execution model for the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) This decision marks a defining moment in India\u2019s efforts to develop a fifth-generation stealth fighter jet capable of meeting future warfare requirements and matching global standards in air combat technology. The Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) , in collaboration with private industry partners, will spearhead the development of AMCA, a stealth-heavy, multi-role aircraft. The plan is to produce five prototypes under a budget exceeding 15,000 crore . The Cabinet Committee on Security , led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had approved the full-scale engineering development in 2024, with a projected delivery target of 2035 . Features and Capabilities of AMCA The AMCA is envisioned as a twin-engine, 25-tonne aircraft equipped with advanced stealth characteristics , including internal weapons bays , sensor fusion , and super cruise capability . These features are designed to significantly reduce radar visibility, allowing the aircraft to engage in deep-penetration missions and precision strikes with minimal detection. Key technological highlights of the AMCA include: Internal Fuel Capacity : 6.5 tonnes Electronic Pilot : AI-assisted decision-making system Integrated Vehicle Health Management : Predictive maintenance for reduced downtime Net-centric Warfare Suite : Real-time combat coordination, including seamless integration with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) Weapon Load : Internal bay capable of carrying 1,500 kg, including four long-range air-to-air missiles and precision-guided munitions The AMCA's features put it in the same league as advanced fifth-generation fighters like the F-35 Lightning II (USA), Sukhoi Su-57 (Russia), and Chengdu J-20 (China). These aircraft emphasize stealth, multi-role capabilities, and network-enabled warfare. Strategic Significance and Global Comparison The AMCA project aligns with India\u2019s \u2018Atmanirbhar Bharat\u2019 initiative, aimed at strengthening indigenous defence production. By developing a fifth-generation stealth platform, India joins an elite group of nations with cutting-edge aerial combat capabilities. Unlike fourth-generation fighters or India\u2019s Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) variants, AMCA will possess: Low Electromagnetic Signature High Stealth Index Enhanced Avionics and Situational Awareness Comparative platforms like the F-35 offer stealth and combat capabilities with internal fuel capacities exceeding 18,000 pounds and payloads of up to 18,000 pounds, while Russia\u2019s Su-57 boasts supersonic speeds and high manoeuvrability. The AMCA, though smaller in payload and size, promises comparable stealth and digital integration tailored to Indian defence needs. Challenges Ahead: Engine Development and Timeline A critical challenge in the AMCA programme lies in developing an appropriate engine . The current plan involves a joint venture with a foreign Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) to develop a next-gen engine that meets thrust, efficiency, and stealth requirements. The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has committed to delivering the first operational AMCA unit by 2035 , which marks a ten-year development cycle starting from its sanction in 2024. India\u2019s ambitious aerospace roadmap also includes other key indigenous defence systems, such as: LCA Mk II Very Short Range Air Defence System (VSHORAD) Man-Portable Anti-Tank Guided Missile (MPATGM) Generational Leap in Air Warfare Capability The AMCA programme represents a transformative leap for India\u2019s air power. The shift from legacy 3rd and 4th generation platforms, like the MiG-21 , Mirage 2000 , and even the Tejas Mk1 , towards a fifth-generation stealth fighter embodies the evolution of India\u2019s defence doctrine into one that prioritizes technology superiority, survivability , and force multiplication . Each successive generation of fighter jets, from basic jet propulsion in Gen-1 to radar integration in Gen-2, multi-role capabilities in Gen-3, and sensor fusion in Gen-5, reflects the changing nature of aerial warfare. AMCA\u2019s induction will elevate India\u2019s operational readiness across multiple theatres, including both land and maritime domains. newspaper.pdf ( Size: 420.0 KB ) Latest Article See All IndiGo Meltdown Dec. 5, 2025, 2:34 p.m. Economics India to Expand Its Busiest Rail Corridors: What\u2019s Planned Dec. 5, 2025, 2:08 p.m. Economics Census 2027 - Counting India, Renewing the R", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

An Operation That Was Also About a Self-Reliant India May 27, 2025 Context Over the past decade, India has undergone a remarkable transformation across economic, technological, and strategic spheres. Central to this metamorphosis is the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has championed the vision of India not just as a participant in the global economy but as a leader in innovation, manufacturing, and strategic technologies. This period has seen the emergence of India as a globally engaged, self-reliant, and resilient nation. India\u2019s Industrial Resurgence and Manufacturing Drive Make in India Campaign The launch of the \u2018Make in India\u2019 initiative in 2014 marked a watershed moment in India\u2019s industrial policy. It signalled a shift from being a passive player in global manufacturing to aspiring to become a manufacturing powerhouse. The initiative introduced sweeping reforms to enhance the ease of doing business , streamline regulatory approvals, and attract both domestic and foreign direct investment. These reforms sparked renewed interest in sectors such as electronics, defence, and automobiles. PLI Schemes to Strengthen Atmanirbhar Bharat To strengthen these efforts, the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes were introduced, further increasing India\u2019s competitiveness as a manufacturing destination. In 2020, the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-Reliant India Mission) intensified this momentum by emphasizing the need for modern, globally integrated manufacturing value chains. This initiative aimed not only to boost economic growth but also to ensure national security by reducing dependence on critical imports. Strategic sectors like defence manufacturing , semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and critical minerals became focal points. These sectors are pivotal not just for economic growth but also for enhancing India\u2019s strategic autonomy. Some Other Remarkable Transformation Towards a Self-Reliant Powerhouse Rise of a Global Innovation Leader Parallel to its industrial push, India has rapidly emerged as a global innovation hub. With the world\u2019s third-largest startup ecosystem , Indian startups are making global waves across domains including fintech, agritech, health tech, and edtech. Beyond commercial success, startups are now contributing strategically in fields like defence technology, cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and space exploration . India's innovation prowess is reinforced through strategic international partnerships. Programs like the U.S.-India TRUST initiative and the India-France road map have developed collaborations in cutting-edge areas such as AI, quantum computing, and defence technologies. Defence Indigenisation and Strategic Capability India\u2019s increasing focus on indigenous defence manufacturing was vividly illustrated by Operation Sindoor , a successful mission that deployed domestically developed defence technologies. This operation demonstrated the effectiveness and precision of Indian-made equipment and symbolized the country\u2019s transition from an arms importer to a credible defence exporter. As a result of these initiatives, India\u2019s defence exports rose to \u20b923,622 crore in FY25 , with projections to reach \u20b950,000 crore by 2029 . The private sector played a crucial role in this success, contributing over \u20b915,000 crore . Much of the technology used in Operation Sindoor was a product of the Make in India and Atmanirbhar Bharat initiatives, making it a milestone validation of the country\u2019s decade-long focus on self-reliance and technological resilience. Technological Leadership and Future Readiness In an era where technological prowess defines national power , India has recognized the strategic imperative of investing in future-critical technologies. Government-led missions such as the National Quantum Mission and the India Semiconductor Mission are establishing India as a hub for advanced research and development. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), with achievements like the Chandrayaan and Gaganyaan missions, has showcased India\u2019s growing capabilities in space technology. However, sustainable technological leadership cannot rest on government efforts alone; it must be a collective national enterprise involving industry, academia, and startups . Industry\u2019s Role in India\u2019s Technological Journey and a Defining Moment for India Industry\u2019s Role in India\u2019s Technological Journey The Indian private sector is playing a pivotal role in building India\u2019s high-tech capabilities across semiconductors, clean tech, next-generation mobility, defence, and electronics . In space, industry has contributed critical components for satellites and launch vehicles. In defence, it is developing advanced technologies and participating in joint ventures for drones , combat platforms, and missiles.

As India contemplates its historical identity and strategic aspirations, it remains tethered to a recurring pattern of hostility with Pakistan, a state persistently driven by military dominance and religious nationalism. Amid these developments, it is important to explore the political and military dimensions of the India-Pakistan conflict, the role of external powers, the impact of technology on modern warfare , and the implications for India's strategic preparedness in a volatile, multipolar world. Historical Rivalry and Ideological Divide India\u2019s civilisational richness and commitment to democratic secularism stand in stark contrast to Pakistan\u2019s military-dominated governance and ideological orientation. Despite suffering repeated setbacks in wars and skirmishes with India, Pakistan continues to provoke conflict under the banner of \u2018 bleeding India by a thousand cuts .\u2019 This hostile posture stems from a deep-rooted aversion to India\u2019s secular success and its ascent as a global power. Pakistan\u2019s current state of internal turmoil, marked by political instability and the military's unchallenged control, makes it a volatile neighbour. Field Marshal Asim Munir\u2019s public declaration of Pakistan as a religious state distinct from India not only underscores this ideological chasm but also signals a continuation of aggressive posturing, especially regarding Kashmir, which remains a flashpoint in bilateral tensions. The Geopolitical Context and Western Interests The global response to conflicts reveals a stark inconsistency in moral standards. While the West has heavily invested diplomatic resources in the Ukraine conflict, the silence on crises like Gaza highlights a racialized hierarchy in international responses. This inconsistency is evident in the way the West hastily moved to de-escalate the India-Pakistan conflict once it became clear that Pakistan was losing. More intriguingly, geopolitics and resource diplomacy play an increasingly central role. Speculations that the U.S. intervened in South Asia due to its interest in Pakistan\u2019s critical minerals, such as lithium and rare earth elements, suggest that mineral wealth is becoming a strategic bargaining chip, much like Ukraine\u2019s mineral diplomacy. These dynamic highlights the transactional nature of modern diplomacy, where resources often override values or justice. Military Dominance and Political Dysfunction in Pakistan The erosion of democratic processes in Pakistan is now overt. Civilian leadership exists merely in name , with the military shaping both domestic policies and foreign engagements. Imran Khan\u2019s political sidelining, and the symbolic premiership of Shehbaz Sharif, reflect a system where electoral democracy is subjugated to military hegemony. This political reality has serious ramifications for peace in South Asia, as military regimes are historically more prone to conflict escalation than civilian governments. The military's framing of Pakistan as the successor to the Islamic polity of Medina reinforces a religious nationalism that not only alienates India but destabilises regional peace. This ideological framework promotes a permanent state of confrontation , especially regarding territorial disputes like Kashmir. Technological Shifts in Warfare, Future of Warfare and Strategic Gaps Technological Shifts in Warfare One of the most revealing aspects of the recent conflict is the integration of advanced military technologies. The India-Pakistan engagement served as a live demonstration platform for foreign defence suppliers. With India deploying Rafale jets and kamikaze drones, and Pakistan relying on Chinese J-10Cs and Turkish drones, the subcontinent has become a proxy theatre for competing military technologies. This technological showdown highlighted several key trends: The importance of escalation dominance : the ability to control the pace and scale of a conflict. The centrality of drones and electronic warfare in modern engagements. The increasing role of multi-layered air defence systems . Although propaganda from China and Pakistan touts integrated radar-missile operations, there is no confirmed evidence of such successful coordination. What is certain, however, is India\u2019s superior air defence capabilities, strengthened by systems like the Aakash, S-400, and Barak , which provided effective protection. India did not even need to employ the BrahMos missile, underscoring its military restraint and preparedness. Future of Warfare and Strategic Gaps The conflict serves as a clarion call that future wars will be fought through speed, technology, and system integration. India\u2019s current advantage in escalation capabilities may not last indefinitely .

India's Maritime Resurgence and the Strategic Imperative of Indigenous Marine Engines May 31, 2025 Context: The 2025 Union Budget has laid a strong foundation for India's shipbuilding sector . Key announcements include Rs 25,000-crore Maritime Development Fund , establishment of mega shipbuilding clusters, customs duty exemptions for shipbuilding inputs, infrastructure status for large vessels, etc. Strategic global partnerships and private investments aim to position India among the top five shipbuilding nations by 2047. However, to truly lead, India must build what powers the ship - an engine. The Engine Gap - A Strategic Vulnerability: Current scenario: Over 90% of marine engines (above 6 MW) on Indian ships are imported. This import is dominated by five global manufacturers : MAN Energy Solutions (Germany), W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 (Finland), Rolls-Royce (UK), Caterpillar-MaK (US/Germany), and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (Japan). Strategic risks: Dependence on proprietary electronic control units (ECUs), software, and IP-bound components. Export control regulations (EU Dual-Use, US EAR, Japan METI) can block supplies citing national security concerns - creating technological chokepoints . Indigenous Efforts: Initial step: Indian Navy\u2019s Rs 270-crore deal with Kirloskar Oil Engines Ltd to develop a 6 MW marine diesel engine. Vision: Development of 30 MW class engines for larger vessels and warships. Challenges to Indigenous Marine Engine Development: Lack of modern engine design capabilities: Marine engine design is a critical determinant of propulsion efficiency , thermal performance, emissions compliance, structural durability, and system integration in large vessels. These designs must optimize key parameters to meet International Maritime Organization Tier III emission standards and enable integration with hybrid propulsion, waste heat recovery. India\u2019s dependence on foreign OEMs: Restricts its ability to modify engines for military profiles, optimize for local climatic and operational conditions, or transition to fuel-flexible, autonomous maritime systems. Metallurgical deficiency: It is India\u2019s most significant and foundational hurdle that cuts across materials science, manufacturing precision, and component durability under extreme thermal and mechanical conditions. Materials like high-chromium steels, nickel-based superalloys , and thermally stable composites are essential, but India lacks capability to produce these at required scale and quality. Tribology (science of wear, lubrication, and friction) and precision manufacturing bottlenecks: High-efficiency marine engines demand components with tailored surface properties to reduce wear and frictional losses over thousands of operating hours. This necessitates advanced coatings like thermal barrier ceramics, diamond-like carbon and plasma-sprayed composites, which require both sophisticated application techniques and precision control. India\u2019s ecosystem lacks scalable industrial integration. Outdated training and skill development: Training institutes use obsolete models. Potential solution: Decommissioned modern engines from Alang (world\u2019s largest) ship-breaking yard for training purposes. Strategic Way Forward: Startup-led innovation: Leverage startups for agility, cross-disciplinary innovation, and risk-taking ability. Government role: Promote innovation missions , design-linked incentives, and dedicated marine propulsion R&D. Start-ups must be supported not only with capital , but also through access to testbeds, IP support, and public procurement guarantees. Need for access to: 3D modeling software. Thermodynamic and combustion simulation tools. Structural/thermal stress analysis systems. Embedded system development platforms. Institutional support: IIT Madras and others can serve as anchor nodes, supporting venture creation with lab-to-market pipelines. Conclusion - Engine of Independence: While India is advancing in ship construction, engine production remains a critical gap. Indigenous marine engine development is vital for strategic autonomy , similar to the jet engine challenge in aviation (e.g., Tejas fighter jet). Without domestic engines, India risks maritime dependency even in indigenously built ships.

Decline in Government School Enrolment: A Wake-Up Call for Indian States May 31, 2025 Why in the News? The Union Ministry of Education (MoE) has asked multiple States to take \u201cremedial steps\u201d to reverse the trend of students choosing private schools over government schools. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Enrolment Decline (Introduction, Statistics, Govt\u2019s Concerns, Response, Way Forward, etc.) Introduction The Union Ministry of Education has flagged a concerning trend in several Indian states where students are increasingly opting for private schools over government-run institutions. This shift, highlighted during recent Project Approval Board (PAB) meetings for the Samagra Shiksha scheme (2025-26), has prompted the Centre to urge states to identify the root causes and implement corrective measures. The issue underscores a growing challenge in India's public education system, where aspirations for quality learning environments are prompting a move away from government institutions. The Enrolment Decline: States and Figures According to UDISE+ (Unified District Information System for Education Plus) 2023-24 data, the enrolment gap between government and private schools has widened across numerous states. Telangana: Out of 42,901 schools, 70% are government schools, but they account for only 38.11% of enrolments, compared to 60.75% in private schools. Uttarakhand: While 71.84% of schools are government-run, only 36.68% of students are enrolled in them, with unaided schools accounting for 54.39%. Andhra Pradesh: The state has 73.32% government schools but only 46.33% enrolment in them. Private schools, with just 24.82% of the institutions, attract over 52% of the enrolment. Tamil Nadu: Government schools comprise 64% of all schools but see only 37% enrolment. Private schools, despite being 21% of the total, account for 46% of student enrolment. Kerala and Maharashtra: Both states reported declining enrolments in government and aided schools. Maharashtra\u2019s enrolment dropped from 1.63 crore in 2018-19 to 1.50 crore in 2023-24, while Kerala saw a drop from 46.37 lakh in 2022-23 to 45.50 lakh in 2023-24. Other Territories: Similar patterns were observed in Delhi, Ladakh, Puducherry, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, and Dadra & Nagar Haveli & Daman and Diu. Government\u2019s Concerns and Response The Ministry of Education termed the trend \u201cdisturbing,\u201d especially in light of the significant financial investment made in government schools. It emphasized that such enrolment shifts are occurring despite substantial expenditure under schemes like Samagra Shiksha and PM POSHAN . The ministry urged states to conduct a sincere and data-driven analysis to understand the reasons behind the exodus from government schools. Suggestions included: Identifying Structural Gaps: Many government schools lack competitive infrastructure, digital resources, and sufficient teaching staff, pushing parents toward private alternatives. Improving Public Perception: States were advised to focus on \u201cgovernment school branding\u201d to enhance public trust and reverse enrolment trends. Using Data Smartly: While Kerala and Maharashtra defended their numbers by citing verification-led clean-ups, the Ministry wants better distinction between technical data corrections and actual educational shifts. Junior Class Enrolment Dip: The preference for private schools is particularly strong in early education stages, signalling the need for improving foundational literacy in government schools. A Bigger Picture: Education Aspirations and Private School Surge The growing popularity of private schools highlights broader societal aspirations. Many families, even from low-income groups, believe private schools offer better English instruction, discipline, and exam preparedness. According to UDISE+ data, private school enrolment rose to over 9 crore (36%) of India\u2019s total 24.80 crore student population in 2023-24, up from 33% in 2022-23. Even though the pandemic disrupted traditional schooling, the preference for private education has bounced back. In fact, the share of private school enrolment in the pre-pandemic year 2019-20 was 37%, showing that the trend is not new but now gaining sharper momentum. Way Forward: Recommendations for States To counter the drift toward private education and restore faith in public schooling, the following steps are being emphasized: Upgrading Infrastructure: Providing basic facilities such as clean toilets, digital classrooms, and safe campuses. Teacher Training and Recruitment: Investing in quality teacher education and reducing pupil-teacher ratios. Outreach and Awareness Campaigns: Building a positive narrative around government schools and highlighting success stories.

Launched in early May as retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, Operation Sindoor marked the first direct drone-led military conflict between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan. Over four days, both nations shifted to a new mode of engagement centered on Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) \u2014including armed drones, loitering munitions, and electronic decoys\u2014operating below the threshold of full-scale war. Prior to the operation, Israeli Heron MK-II and indigenous TAPAS-BH-201 (Rustom-II) UAVs conducted deep surveillance into Pakistani airspace. From May 7, India struck nine targets, and both sides deployed a wide range of drones for real-time ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance) and precision strikes . Tactics included the use of decoy drones to spoof enemy radars and drain interceptor stocks.

The Case for a Special Fiscal Package for Andhra Pradesh May 30, 2025 Context The bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh in 2014, resulting in the formation of Telangana, left the former in a state of deep financial distress. This fiscal imbalance continues to haunt the State , as it grapples with structural handicaps and political decisions that have eroded its revenue base. The pressing question is whether the Centre, particularly through the Finance Commission, should extend a special financial dispensation to Andhra Pradesh to rectify this imbalance. Therefore, it is important to explore the historical context of the bifurcation, the ineffectiveness of current policy responses, and the rationale for a more objective , formula-based solution to restore fiscal equity. Historical Background and the Demand for Special Category Status The genesis of Andhra Pradesh's fiscal distress lies in the 2014 bifurcation , which separated Telangana, and with it, Hyderabad, the economic powerhouse of the undivided State. This division stripped Andhra Pradesh of a significant portion of its tax base. In recognition of this structural loss, then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh assured Parliament that Andhra Pradesh would be granted \u2018special category\u2019 status. However, this assurance was not codified in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, leaving the State without any formal backing for its demand. When the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) assumed power in 2014, Andhra Pradesh\u2019s plea for special status was repeatedly rebuffed. The NDA cited the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, which advocated discontinuation of the special category designation in favour of a more equitable distribution mechanism across all States. Thus, the critical promise made in Parliament remained unfulfilled . Current Fiscal Challenges and The Problem with Special Category Status Today Current Fiscal Challenges Now, in 2024, with Chandrababu Naidu returning as Chief Minister, Andhra Pradesh finds itself confronting depleted coffers. Years of populist welfare schemes and competitive electoral promises h ave compounded the fiscal burden. While the Centre is not obliged to fund state-level political choices, it does bear responsibility for the structural imbalances created by bifurcation. Without significant external support, Andhra Pradesh risks fiscal stagnation, compromising its ability to deliver basic services and pursue development goals. The Problem with Special Category Status Today While reinstating the special category status might appear to be a straightforward solution , this option no longer carries the benefits it once did. In earlier decades, such status came with substantial central assistance through Plan funds. \u2018 Today, it merely offers access to slightly concessional external loans, rendering the designation more symbolic than substantive. For Andhra Pradesh, a weakened special category status would offer little financial relief while failing to address the root cause of its fiscal woes. The Precedent of Fiscal Disparities in State Bifurcations and A Better Alternative The Precedent of Fiscal Disparities in State Bifurcations The case for such a package is not without precedent. Historical data from state bifurcations post-2000 show that newly formed States, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and Telangana, have consistently fared better in terms of per capita own revenue compared to their parent States. The fiscal impact on the rump States, however, has been uneven. While Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh weathered the split with minimal revenue losses, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh experienced significant declines in fiscal capacity. This suggests a rational basis for compensatory packages: when a State\u2019s own revenue declines by more than 10% as a direct result of bifurcation, it should qualify for targeted assistance over a fixed period. By this metric, both Bihar and Andhra Pradesh are eligible for special financial consideration. A Better Alternative: Special Assistance through the Finance Commission A more effective and equitable solution lies in crafting a tailored financial assistance package through the Finance Commission. Unlike politically motivated, one-off packages, such as those given to regions like Bundelkhand or Kalahandi-Balangir-Koraput, a Finance Commission-recommended package would enjoy constitutional legitimacy and be grounded in objective analysis. This approach would help preserve the integrity of India\u2019s federal structure. It would also offer Andhra Pradesh meaningful relief without setting a dangerous precedent of ad hoc central interventions driven by electoral calculations. Conclusion The fiscal plight of Andhra Pradesh is a direct outcome of a structural division over which the State had limited control. While political decisions and local governance also play roles in exacerbating the situation, the underlying imbalance created by the bifurcation must", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

Focus on Heat-Resilience Despite the Monsoon May 27, 2025 Context The national conference India 2047: Building a Climate-Resilient Future showcased an urgent truth: climate change is not a distant threat; it is a present and intensifying health crisis. Bringing together diverse voices, from garment workers to climate modellers, paediatricians to architects, the event highlighted the necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration. If India is to safeguard its population from the worsening impacts of extreme heat, the health system must evolve from its current reactive model to one that is proactive, preventive, and rooted in equity. The Hidden Toll of Heat on Public Health Despite the early onset of the monsoon, India has already endured another brutal summer. Rising temperatures exert immense strain on public health , exacerbating dehydration, heatstroke, and chronic illnesses. The current health response, however, is skewed toward crisis management, hospital admissions, IV fluids, and emergency care , rather than anticipation and prevention. This reactive model is both unsustainable and insufficient in the face of recurring heatwaves. Challenges and Prospective Solutions Primary Care as the First Line of Defence To combat heat-related health issues effectively, India's primary health-care system must be fortified and climate-proofed. Community health workers such as ASHAs (Accredited Social Health Activists) are strategically positioned to become champions of heat safety. With the right training and protocols, they can deliver early warnings, educate communities, and provide vital interventions , from hydration advice to checking on vulnerable individuals. The integration of meteorological early warning systems with local health networks can further enable swift, community-level action. For example, a forecast of extreme heat could trigger door-to-door visits, WhatsApp alerts, and distribution of hydration kits, simple yet impactful measures that have already shown success in urban centres like Ahmedabad. Importantly, prevention must also be integrated into chronic disease management. Patients with diabetes, heart disease, or kidney issues are particularly susceptible to heat stress, and their treatment must adapt accordingly during summer months. Updating Clinical Protocols for Heat Readiness Despite the rising frequency of heatwaves, clinical awareness remains alarmingly low. Many health-care providers fail to screen for heat exposure, and cases of heatstroke are frequently misdiagnosed or missed entirely. There is an urgent need to establish clear, standardised clinical protocols for identifying and managing heat-related illnesses. Simple measures, such as conducting summer readiness drills in hospitals, creating dedicated \u2018heat corners\u2019 in emergency departments, and pre-stocking cooling kits, can greatly enhance the capacity of health facilities to deal with the heat crisis. These steps reflect a shift from treating symptoms to proactively preventing illness. The Way Forward Beyond Medicine: The Role of Interdisciplinary Action Preventing the health impacts of extreme heat requires more than a medical response. It demands systemic, cross-sectoral collaboration. Urban planners must redesign housing and public spaces to reduce heat exposure . Water departments must ensure reliable access during peak summers. Labour regulations must protect outdoor workers with mandated rest periods and shaded spaces. Crucially, climate scientists must work closely with health officials to ensure that interventions are data-driven and targeted. India must move away from isolated \u2018centres of excellence\u2019 and towards networks of excellence , interdisciplinary teams that combine public health, urban development, labour rights, and grassroots knowledge to create context-specific, scalable solutions. These might include misting shelters in informal settlements or cool roofing in community centres and Anganwadi facilities. Equity at the Core of Climate Resilience Extreme heat is not just an environmental hazard; it is a force multiplier of social injustice. The brunt of rising temperatures is borne by society\u2019s most vulnerable : street vendors, schoolchildren, the elderly in poorly ventilated homes, and daily wage workers under tin roofs. For them, stay indoors is not practical guidance but a stark reminder of systemic neglect. Therefore, equity must be at the heart of climate resilience . Mapping social vulnerabilities , such as occupation, housing, and access to resources, is as critical as tracking temperature trends. Responsive measures such as early morning health checks during heat alerts , mobile hydration stations in low-income areas, and subsidised cool shelters are not just humane but necessary. Protecting the most exposed is both a scientific imperative and a moral duty. Conclusion The window for meaningful action is rapidly closing .

Decline in Poverty and Inequality in India: Insights from NSO Household Surveys (2011\u20132024) May 29, 2025 Context: The Household Consumption Expenditure Surveys ( HCES ) for 2022\u201323 and 2023\u201324 by the National Statistical Office ( NSO ) provide updated insights into poverty and inequality trends in India. There is the need to explore trends in head count ratio, the depth of poverty and trends in inequality from 2011-12 to 2023-24. Defining Poverty - Based on the Rangarajan Committee Methodology: Rural poverty lines (monthly per capita consumption expenditure - MPCE): 2011\u201312: \u20b9972 2022\u201323: \u20b91,837 2023\u201324: \u20b91,940 Urban poverty lines (MPCE): 2011\u201312: \u20b91,407 2022\u201323: \u20b92,603 2023\u201324: \u20b92,736 (For a family of five: \u20b913,680). Poverty Reduction Trends: Declining poverty ratios: Total poverty ratio (rural + urban) - 2011\u201312: 29.5% 2022\u201323: 9.5% 2023\u201324: 4.9% Poverty declined significantly between 2011-12 and 2023-24 ( 2.05 percentage points per annum ), though the rate of decline was slightly less compared to the period 2004-05 to 2011-12 (2.2 percentage points per annum). Global comparison \u2013 World Bank insights: In India, extreme poverty (living on less than $2.15 per day in purchasing power parity terms) - 2011\u201312: 16.2% 2022\u201323: 2.3% - more than 170 million were lifted above conditions of extreme poverty in this period. The number of people below the poverty line criteria for lower-middle-income countries \u2014 $3.65 per day \u2014 fell from 61.8% to 28.1%. Possible Drivers of 2023\u201324 Poverty Reduction: Key macroeconomic factors: GDP growth: GDP growth increased from 7.6% in 2022-23 to 9.2% in 2023-24 \u2014 an increase of 1.6 percentage points in one year . CPI inflation: The consumer price index (CPI) declined from 6.7% in 2022-23 to 5.4% in 2023-24 \u2014 a decline of 1.3 percentage points. Food Inflation: However, food inflation increased from 6.6% to 7.5% during the same period. Observation: As there are no major changes in welfare schemes, GDP growth appears as the most plausible reason for poverty reduction in 2023\u201324. However, caution is advised \u2014 trends must be validated by future data. Depth of Poverty - Beyond the Headcount Ratio: Headcount ratio vs poverty depth: The headcount ratio measures the percentage of the population living below the poverty line, while poverty depth (also known as the poverty gap) measures the average distance between the poor and the poverty line. Observation: It can be concluded that many non-poor lie just above the poverty line (115\u2013125% of PL). This means that most people are clustered around the poverty threshold . Inequality Trends - Consumption Expenditure: Gini coefficient: The Gini coefficient is a statistical measure designed to quantify the level of income inequality within a population. It is a numerical value between 0 and 1 , where 0 represents perfect equality (everyone has the same income) and 1 represents perfect inequality (one person has all the income). Observation: The decline in inequality was higher for urban areas . The inequality in consumption (Rural + Urban) declined significantly in one year \u2014 the Gini coefficient fell from 0.282 in 2022-23 to 0.253 points \u2014 a decline of 0.029 points. On the other hand, the decline during the 11-year period 2011-12 to 2022-23 is almost similar. Conclusion: Poverty in India is now in single digits , and inequality has declined moderately. The significant one-year drop in poverty (2022\u201323 to 2023\u201324) may be driven by GDP growth but requires more data to confirm if it's a lasting trend. The concentration of the poor near the poverty line indicates better prospects for targeted policy interventions.

Don\u2019t Merely Enrol Students, But Equip Them with Skills May 31, 2025 Context As the admission season unfolds across India , colleges and universities display banners advertising knowledge, transformation, and research excellence. The growing enrolment in undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral programmes signals a vibrant academic ecosystem. However, this apparent progress masks a troubling reality : the number of degrees being awarded is outpacing the creation of meaningful job opportunities. This mismatch between education and employment poses a critical challenge to India\u2019s socio-economic development. The Paradox of Higher Education and Rising Unemployment Data from the Ministry of Statistics presents a paradox, unemployment rates in India rise with higher levels of education. This suggests a fundamental disconnect between academic attainment and employability. The situation is especially acute in non-elite institutions located in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. These colleges, which cater to the majority of India\u2019s student population, often lack adequate resources, industry linkages, and updated curricula. While elite institutions occasionally attract attention for placement woes, the steady decline in employability among graduates of everyday colleges frequently goes unnoticed. Instruction in many of these institutions remains overwhelmingly theoretical. A student of English literature might explore Shakespearean tragedies but graduate without the ability to draft a professional email. Likewise, economics graduates may master complex theories while being unfamiliar with everyday tools like Microsoft Excel. This academic-practical divide results in a large population of young, educated Indians who struggle to convert their qualifications into career opportunities. The Cultural and Structural Roots of the Problem This crisis is rooted not only in institutional shortcomings but also in India\u2019s entrenched academic culture, which often glorifies abstract scholarship over practical skills. Within academic circles, including prestigious universities , intellectual pursuits are prized, while immediate employability is sometimes dismissed as a lesser goal. As a result, many students pursue postgraduate degrees and PhDs as an escape from the job market, eventually entering academia themselves and perpetuating a cycle that prioritises credentials over capability. Recognising this systemic issue, various government initiatives such as Skill India, Start-Up India, and the National Education Policy have sought to promote vocational training, skill development, and entrepreneurship. While these policies mark important steps forward, their implementation has been uneven. Many academic programmes continue to rely on rote learning, and while trendy courses in artificial intelligence or entrepreneurship may be introduced, they often lack substance and integration into the broader curriculum. Vocational Stigma, the Societal Lens and A Path Toward Reform Vocational Stigma and the Societal Lens The Indian education system also faces a societal dilemma: while degrees are revered as symbols of upward mobility, they increasingly fail to deliver on that promise. In contrast, countries like China and Japan have strategically positioned vocational and technical education at the heart of their economic planning. In India, however, such training is often viewed as a fallback for those who are academically unsuccessful. This stigma undermines the viability and attractiveness of skill-based education, limiting its transformative potential. T his is not an argument against liberal or abstract education. Such education plays a crucial role in nurturing critical thinking and creativity. However, the system must also deliver tangible economic outcomes. For students, particularly from under-resourced institutions and smaller towns, degrees must serve as gateways to agency, opportunity, and dignity. A Path Toward Reform A meaningful solution requires integrating practical skill modules into the core structure of general degree programmes. Modules on communication , digital literacy, data analysis, budgeting, and other applied skills should not be optional add-ons but essential components. Doctoral education, too , must evolve to prepare graduates for a wide array of careers, in policy-making, industry, consulting, development, and beyond, rather than confining them to academia alone. Furthermore, the widespread aspiration among graduates for government jobs reflects a narrow perception of viable employment. While public sector roles remain significant, expanding opportunities in the private sector and entrepreneurial domains is essential. Strengthening employability will reduce the overdependence on competitive exams and diversify career options for the youth.

A Case of Practical, Pragmatic and Innovative Education May 29, 2025 Context The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 marks a significant reform in India's education sector. It aims to align academic pursuits with real-world needs, enhance global competitiveness, and cultivate a robust ecosystem of innovation and sustainable employment. As a strategic, long-term overhaul, the NEP is designed to develop originality, empower students with practical skills , and integrate Indian education into the global landscape. Transformative Goals of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 Reimagining Employability through Education One of the most transformative goals of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 is to fundamentally reimagine how Indian education prepares students for the workforce. In an era where traditional degrees no longer guarantee meaningful employment, the NEP aims to align academic curricula with the evolving demands of the labour market. It does this by embedding flexibility, vocational relevance, and industry integration into the core of the education system. Flexible Learning Pathways At the heart of this transformation is the introduction of a four-year undergraduate programme with multiple entry and exit options. This flexible structure allows students to earn a certificate after one year, a diploma after two, or a degree after three or four years , depending on when they choose to exit. Crucially, students can rejoin the system later to complete or upgrade their qualifications. This ensures that those who need to leave education temporarily, due to financial, personal, or professional reasons, are not penalised or left behind. This modular approach recognises the diverse life circumstances of learners and replaces the rigid, one-size-fits-all model with a system that supports continuous and lifelong learning. It offers a pragmatic solution to high dropout rates, enabling students to accumulate meaningful credentials and re-enter education or employment more smoothly. Strengthening the Link Between Academia and Industry Another cornerstone of the NEP is its emphasis on closing the gap between academic learning and real-world skills. Traditionally, Indian education has been criticised for focusing too heavily on rote learning and theoretical knowledge, with limited applicability in the job market. The NEP addresses this by promoting the vocationalisation of education, integrating skill-based courses, hands-on projects, and industry-relevant training into curricula across disciplines. Internships and apprenticeships have been mainstreamed within higher education institutions, creating opportunities for students to gain on-the-job experience. Building Multi-Dimensional Career Readiness Employability in the 21st century demands more than domain knowledge. Employers increasingly value a combination of cognitive, technical, and soft skills , such as communication, adaptability, problem-solving, and digital literacy. The NEP recognises this by promoting a multidisciplinary approach to education. Students are encouraged to study across disciplines , engineering students can take humanities courses, and vice versa, helping them develop broader perspectives and more versatile skill sets. Some Other Notable Aspects of NEP 2020 Strengthening Global Competitiveness One of the notable impacts of the NEP is its contribution to the global standing of Indian education. The number of Indian universities listed in international rankings, such as the QS 500 and QS Asia Rankings, has seen a significant rise. Institutions like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) have featured prominently in subject-specific global rankings , reflecting the improved quality of education and research. The rise in patents filed, from 7,405 in 2021\u201322 to 19,155 in 2022\u201323, underscores India\u2019s strengthening research landscape. Furthermore, India's climb from 76th to 39th in the Global Innovation Index demonstrates a maturing innovation ecosystem , sustained by reforms and targeted policy interventions. Focus on R&D Several national initiatives have played a role in these improvements. The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), AICTE\u2019s IDEA Labs, and the Scheme for Promotion of Academic and Research Collaboration (SPARC ) exemplify the institutional commitment to nurturing research. SPARC, for instance, facilitates international research collaborations with institutions from over 28 countries, including the US, UK, Germany, and Australia. This global academic integration positions India as a credible contributor to international knowledge systems. Prioritisation of Indigenous Knowledge NEP 2020 also prioritises indigenous knowledge through the Indian Knowledge System (IKS), aiming to imbue students with traditional wisdom alongside modern scientific understanding.

Rewriting the Script of Early Childhood Education May 30, 2025 Context Nobel Laureate Professor James Heckman once remarked, \u2018 Some kids win the lottery at birth; far too many don\u2019t, and most people struggle to catch up.\u2019 This profound observation highlights the inequality of opportunity that begins at birth and continues throughout life. In India, this disparity is sharply evident, where a child has a one-in-five chance of being born into poverty. Such early disadvantages affect not only health and nutrition but also learning outcomes and long-term earning potential. The Power of Early Investment The Heckman Curve illustrates the significant return on investment that early childhood development offers. Every dollar spent on early childhood education (ECE) can yield returns of $7 to $12. Children who benefit from quality ECE are more likely to achieve higher earnings and improved life outcomes. By the age of five, many cognitive, emotional, and motivational gaps become apparent, making it essential to intervene before formal schooling begins. Unfortunately, this critical window of development is often missed , especially among disadvantaged populations. Challenges Facing India\u2019s ECE System Inadequate Instructional Time and Poor Learning Outcomes One of the most pressing issues is the lack of sufficient instructional time in pre-primary education. Although approximately 5.5 crore children between the ages of 3 and 6 are enrolled across 14 lakh Anganwadis and 56,000 government pre-primary schools , the quality and quantity of learning remain alarmingly low. Anganwadi workers dedicate just 38 minutes per day to preschool instruction , less than one-third of the prescribed two hours. This limited engagement severely restricts cognitive development during the critical early years. Resource Constraints and Underutilisation The second major challenge is the inefficient allocation and underutilization of resources in ECE . Despite its critical importance, government spending on early childhood education is disproportionately low, just \u20b91,263 per child annually, compared to \u20b937,000 per student in the school education system. This funding gap reflects a systemic undervaluing of early education and directly impacts the availability of materials, infrastructure, and trained personnel. Lack of Parental Engagement and Awareness A third and often overlooked challenge lies in engaging parents in their children\u2019s early learning journey. While most parents deeply care about their children's education , many lack the knowledge, tools, or confidence to contribute meaningfully to early learning at home. This is especially true in low-income and rural households , where educational levels of parents are low, and time and resources are constrained. Promising State-Level Initiatives Despite systemic challenges, some Indian states are pioneering innovative solutions. Uttar Pradesh is leading with its recruitment of nearly 11,000 ECE educators for Balavatikas and conducting rigorous training programs for master trainers. Odisha, on the other hand, is establishing Shishu Vatikas in government schools to ensure school readiness for five- and six-year-olds. These initiatives are not just policy experiments; they are tangible steps toward transforming the nation\u2019s educational landscape from the ground up. Looking Ahead: India\u2019s Demographic Dividend As India approaches its centenary of independence in 2047 , more than a billion Indians are expected to join the global workforce. This presents a historic opportunity to shape the country's economic future. Investing in ECE today means equipping tomorrow\u2019s citizens with the skills and capacities necessary to lead. By empowering children through quality early education and involving parents meaningfully, India can help 200 million people escape the constraints of their birth and fulfil their potential. Conclusion Reversing the consequences of the \u2018lottery of birth\u2019 is not a pipe dream, it is a feasible goal with the right investments and strategies. Quality early childhood education, supported by robust state programs and active parental involvement, can provide a strong foundation for lifelong learning and social mobility.

On May 25, a Liberian-flagged cargo ship carrying 640 containers \u2014 including 13 with hazardous materials \u2014 capsized and sank off the Kerala coast. All crew members were safely rescued by the Indian Coast Guard and Navy. The incident raised concerns about a possible oil spill. The Indian Coast Guard deployed Saksham, a ship with pollution response equipment, to handle any spill risks. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Cause of Capsizing Oil Spill International Framework Dealing with Oil Spill: MARPOL Convention Methods of Oil Spill Cleanup Challenges in Cleanup Advisory for Local Population Following Shipwreck Near Kerala Coast Cause of Capsizing The cargo ship MSC ELSA 3 capsized rapidly in the early hours of May 25 due to flooding in one of its cargo holds , as confirmed by the Indian Coast Guard (ICG). A hold refers to a below-deck compartment used for storing cargo. The ship had departed from Vizhinjam port and was headed to Kochi at the time of the incident. Cargo and Fuel Details The vessel was carrying 640 containers, including: 13 with hazardous cargo 12 with calcium carbide 84.44 metric tonnes of diesel 367.1 metric tonnes of furnace oil Oil Spill Monitoring ICG deployed aircraft with advanced oil spill mapping technology to monitor the situation. As of now, no oil spill has been reported. Oil Spill An oil spill occurs when oil accidentally enters oceans, seas, or rivers due to natural disasters, human error, or equipment failure. It spreads quickly and forms a layer on the water surface because of its lighter density. Environmental Impact The oil layer blocks sunlight, affecting photosynthesis in marine plants and phytoplankton, which are crucial for oxygen production and food chains. Harm to Marine Life Birds lose insulation as oil coats their feathers, leading to hypothermia and drowning. Fish and invertebrates may suffer reproductive and growth issues, as noted by the US EPA. Severity Factors The impact depends on: Type and volume of oil Weather conditions Proximity to sensitive ecosystems Long-Term Consequences Severe spills can have decades-long impacts. For instance, the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster released over 4 million barrels of oil over 87 days into the Gulf of Mexico, killing thousands of wildlife. International Framework Dealing with Oil Spill: MARPOL Convention Oil spill prevention is governed by the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL). Originated after major oil spill disasters in the 1970s. The key protocol was issued in 1978. India is a signatory to MARPOL. Scope of MARPOL MARPOL includes six annexes, covering pollution from: Oil Noxious liquid substances Dangerous goods in packaged form Sewage Garbage Air pollution from ships Domestic Implementation in India Enforced through the Merchant Shipping Act. Includes provisions for civil liability and pollution prevention certificates. Indian ships and foreign ships in Indian waters must comply. Preparedness and Enforcement Ports must have oil spill contingency plans. The Indian Coast Guard is the nodal agency for oil spill response and enforcement. Methods of Oil Spill Cleanup Skimming Involves removing oil from the sea surface before it reaches the coast. Most effective in calm seas. In Situ Burning Involves burning concentrated patches of oil directly on the water. Quick but may produce toxic fumes. Chemical Dispersants Break down oil into smaller droplets. Helps microbes degrade oil into less harmful substances. Can be harmful to marine ecosystems. Challenges in Cleanup Rapid Spread of Oil - Oil disperses quickly across water surfaces. Weather Conditions - Rough seas and strong currents hinder cleanup. Variation in Oil Types - Some oils sink or mix with water (emulsify), making removal harder. Environmental Trade-offs - Dispersants may impact marine life. Manual cleanup is slow, labour-intensive, and less effective in remote areas. Advisory for Local Population Following Shipwreck Near Kerala Coast Public Safety Warning The Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) has warned locals not to touch any cargo containers or oil that may wash ashore. Reporting Protocol Residents are urged to immediately inform the police if they see containers or oil along the shore. Risk of Oil Contamination Oil films may appear on the sea surface near the coast. According to INCOIS, oil pollutants may reach Alappuzha, Ambalapuzha, Arattupuzha, and Karunagappally within 36\u201348 hours. These areas are at risk of environmental contamination and need urgent monitoring and response.

India and France have signed a government-to-government deal worth $7.4 billion (around \u20b963,000 crore) for 26 Rafale Marine fighter jets for the Indian Navy. Earlier, 36 Rafale jets were inducted into the Indian Air Force starting in 2021. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Naval Aviation: An Overview Aircraft Carrier: An Overview History of Carrier Aviation in India Why India Needs Aircraft Carriers How Rafale M Will Help the Indian Navy Naval Aviation: An Overview Naval aviation refers to the use of military aircraft by naval forces, operating from aircraft carriers, helicopter-equipped ships, or land bases to support maritime operations. Specialised Aircraft and Operations Naval aviation includes aircraft designed for: Short takeoffs and arrested landings on carriers Air-to-air combat and surface/submarine attacks Maritime reconnaissance and search & rescue Logistics and supply missions Key Roles of Naval Aviation Fleet Air Defence : Protects naval forces beyond the range of land-based air cover. Strategic Power Projection : Projects air power globally without relying on land bases. Anti-Surface Warfare : Targets enemy ships with air-launched weaponry. Support for Amphibious Warfare : Assists in marine landings and inland operations. Mine Countermeasures : Detects and neutralizes enemy sea mines using aerial assets. Importance Naval aviation is vital for sea control, supporting joint naval-ground operations, and projecting power far from home bases. It comprises carrier-based jets, maritime patrol aircraft, helicopters, and unmanned aerial systems. Aircraft Carrier: An Overview An aircraft carrier is a warship that functions as a floating airbase. It is equipped with a full-length flight deck and hangar facilities to support, arm, deploy, and recover aircraft. Key Functions Seaborne Air Power Projection Enables naval forces to project air power far from land-based airfields, enhancing operational reach. Carrier Battle Groups Often the centerpiece of modern naval warfare, playing a critical role in deterrence, sea control, and achieving air superiority. Strategic and Tactical Capabilities Adaptability and Survivability : Aircraft carriers can control seas, conduct strikes, and operate across the electromagnetic spectrum and cyberspace. Global Presence About 50 active carriers are currently in service worldwide. The United States Navy leads with 11 large nuclear-powered carriers, followed by countries such as Brazil, China, France, India, Italy, Russia, Spain, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. History of Carrier Aviation in India India's carrier aviation began with the commissioning of INS Vikrant in 1961, marking the start of the country's naval aviation journey. India continues to expand its carrier fleet, with future plans for additional indigenous carriers . Key Aircraft Carriers in India INS Vikrant (1961-1997): India\u2019s first aircraft carrier, operational for several decades. INS Viraat (1987-2017): Served the Indian Navy for 30 years after being commissioned in 1987. INS Vikramaditya (Since 2013): A Russian-origin carrier, currently in service with the Indian Navy. INS Vikrant (Commissioned in 2022): India\u2019s first indigenously built aircraft carrier, joining the fleet in 2022. Why India Needs Aircraft Carriers Strategic Deterrence and Power Projection Aircraft carriers allow India to assert influence and maintain a favourable balance of power in the Indian Ocean, a region vital for trade, energy, and security. Protection of Maritime Interests With over 90% of India\u2019s trade by volume transported by sea, aircraft carriers help secure Sea Lines of Communication (SLOCs), protect island territories, and deter potential threats. Blue Water Navy Capability Carriers enable the Indian Navy to operate far from its shores, establishing India as a blue water navy capable of extended operations and rapid crisis responses. Continuous Operational Readiness Multiple carriers ensure that at least one is always operational on each coast, even when others are undergoing maintenance or refit. Non-Military Roles In addition to military functions, aircraft carriers are essential for Humanitarian & Disaster Relief (HADR) operations, projecting India\u2019s soft power and providing rapid responses to regional emergencies. How Rafale M Will Help the Indian Navy Enhancing Carrier-Based Fighter Fleet Rafale M jets will augment the current MiG-29K fleet, joining a legacy of carrier-based fighters like Sea Hawks, Alizes, and Sea Harriers.

TN Revives Push for State Autonomy - Echoes of Rajamannar Committee After 50 Years April 29, 2025 Why in News? Citing concerns over the erosion of state powers, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin has set up a high-level committee led by former Supreme Court judge Justice Kurian Joseph to review Centre-State relations and suggest ways to strengthen states' constitutional rights. Nearly 50 years ago, then CM C N Annadurai had formed a similar committee under Dr. P V Rajamannar to recommend measures for maximizing state autonomy without compromising national integrity. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Rajamannar Committee's Observations on Centre-State Relations Renewed Push for Federalism Rajamannar Committee's Observations on Centre-State Relations It noted a growing dominance of the Centre over the States, with state-specific matters increasingly controlled by the Centre, often because the same party ruled both levels of government. Though initiated during Annadurai\u2019s tenure, the Rajamannar Committee report was submitted under M Karunanidhi's leadership to then PM Indira Gandhi. De Facto Centralisation of States The committee argued that although the Constitution appeared federal, its practical implementation had reduced States to mere administrative units of the Centre. Constitutional Provisions Enabling Central Control The report cited Articles 256, 257, and 365. These provisions gave sweeping powers to the Centre. The Centre could issue directions to the States and enforce them. The committee said President\u2019s Rule was used as a drastic and unprecedented constitutional weapon. Key Recommendations Repeal Article 356 to prevent misuse of President\u2019s Rule. Establish a robust Inter-State Council under Article 263 to resolve Centre-State differences through dialogue rather than coercion. Criticism of Extra-Constitutional Institutions The Rajamannar Committee criticised the rise of bodies like the Planning Commission, created by an executive order and not by the Constitution. Central Control Through Financial Powers The committee noted that discretionary grants from the Centre gave it a \"whip in its hands,\" allowing it to control States through financial dependence . It argued that this made the constitutionally mandated Finance Commission irrelevant and reduced States to \"suppliants for aid\" in their own areas. Erosion of Federal Balance The report warned of a growing \"Triple\" threat \u2014central planning, massive grants, and party politics\u2014which was steadily eroding the federal structure. Increasing Central Interference The committee observed that the Centre\u2019s frequent involvement in State matters created the impression of an anxiety to exercise overall supervision, undermining State autonomy. Rethinking the Idea of a Strong Centre The Rajamannar Committee challenged the notion that centralisation strengthens India. It warned that by taking on too many responsibilities, the Centre risks becoming weak. True strength, it argued, lies in restraint and clear focus, not in expansionism. Quoting C N Annadurai\u2019s 1967 speech, the report stressed that while the Centre must have enough powers to safeguard India\u2019s sovereignty. It should not encroach on subjects like health and education, which do not contribute to national security. Renewed Push for Federalism Half a century later, the Stalin-led DMK government is once again questioning the Centre-State balance, amid disputes over NEET, GST compensation, delimitation, and language policy. Mandate of the New Committee The newly formed committee will review the current legal framework and suggest measures to restore the rights of States within the constitutional setup. Uncertain Impact It remains unclear if New Delhi will act on the new committee\u2019s recommendations, as the Rajamannar Report and later reviews by the Sarkaria and Punchhi Commissions were largely ignored. A Call for Cooperation The spirit behind these efforts echoes Annadurai\u2019s 1967 vision of strengthening Centre-State relations through mutual goodwill and understanding. newspaper.pdf ( Size: 606.0 KB ) Latest Article See All IndiGo Meltdown Dec. 5, 2025, 2:34 p.m. Economics India to Expand Its Busiest Rail Corridors: What\u2019s Planned Dec. 5, 2025, 2:08 p.m. Economics Census 2027 - Counting India, Renewing the Republic Dec. 5, 2025, 1:54 p.m. Editorial Analysis Health and National Security Cess on Demerit Goods Dec. 5, 2025, 1:48 p.m. Economics A Missing Link in India\u2019s Mineral Mission Dec. 5, 2025, 1:33 p.m. Editorial Analysis A Day to Pause and Come Down to Earth Dec. 5, 2025, 1:27 p.m. Editorial Analysis Rupee Breaches the 90-Mark Dec. 4, 2025, 1:36 p.m. Economics Putin\u2019s Visit: India\u2013Russia Ties and the Road Ahead Dec. 4, 2025, 1:24 p.m. International Relations Judiciary Flags Major Lapses in Critical Care for Acid Attack Survivors Dec. 4, 2025, 1:13 p.m. Polity & Governance India\u2019s Seven-Point Energy Transition Agenda for 2035 Dec. 4, 2025, 1:05 p.m. Editorial Anal", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

Understanding the 2025 Papal Conclave: Dynamics, Divisions, and Decisions April 29, 2025 Why in the News? Recently, Pope Francis died at the age of 88 at Domus Sanctae Marthae in Vatican City. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Papal Conclave (Background, Governing Rules, Political Divisions, Power Dynamics, Key Issues, etc.) Introduction The Catholic Church has entered a historic moment with the passing of Pope Francis. The Church now stands in the sede vacante period, the interregnum until a new Pope is elected. At the heart of this transition is the Papal Conclave , an ancient, deeply spiritual, yet inherently political process. Governed by strict rules under the apostolic constitution Universi Dominici Gregis (UDG) , the Conclave blends ritual, secrecy, diplomacy, and strategic negotiation to determine the next leader of the global Catholic community. Governing Rules and Procedures of the Conclave The Conclave\u2019s procedures are strictly dictated by UDG , emphasizing complete secrecy and isolation within Vatican City to minimize external influence. Only cardinals under 80 years of age are eligible to vote. Voting requires a two-thirds majority , necessitating broad consensus and preventing narrow factional control. Despite being barred from voting, senior cardinals (over 80) still participate in pre-Conclave deliberations, potentially influencing the electors. Behind the locked doors of the Sistine Chapel, alliances are built , negotiations unfold , and influence is wielded through respected figures known as the 'great electors' . The secrecy ensures that decisions are made based on conscience, away from public or political pressure. Political Divisions within the College of Cardinals The College of Cardinals is notably divided, largely reflecting debates over Pope Francis's reformist legacy and the Church\u2019s future direction. Two broad camps emerge: Reformists/Progressives : Support Pope Francis\u2019s emphasis on pastoral theology over rigid doctrine. Advocate for social justice , climate action , migration rights , and greater inclusion of women and LGBTQ+ Catholics . Conservatives/Traditionalists : Stress liturgical tradition , doctrinal clarity , and a return to pre-Francis norms. Seek to reaffirm established moral teachings and resist perceived doctrinal dilution. However, these divisions are nuanced. Many cardinals from the Global South , Africa, Asia, and Latin America, combine social conservatism (e.g., opposition to same-sex blessings like the Fiducia Supplicans ) with a strong commitment to social justice and environmental advocacy , making their voting behaviour less predictable. Geographical Shifts in Power Dynamics Pope Francis deliberately altered the traditional European dominance in the College of Cardinals: Europeans now constitute only about 39.3% of the electors, down from over 50% in 2013. Asia-Pacific represents about 17%, Latin America 15.6%, and Africa 13.3%. This diversification reflects the global nature of Catholicism and introduces new political complexities. Cardinals from the Global South , shaped by poverty, migration, and interreligious dynamics, will likely influence the focus of the Conclave toward broader global challenges rather than traditional European concerns. The shrinking European share and growing southern representation increase the possibility of a non-European Pope , and make cross-regional coalition-building essential to reach the two-thirds voting threshold. Key Issues Likely to Shape the Conclave Deliberations Several pressing theological and social issues are expected to dominate discussions: Synodality : Pope Francis\u2019s project to promote a more consultative Church faces uncertain prospects, with some seeing it as renewal, others as a threat to hierarchical authority. Handling of LGBTQ+ Issues : The backlash to Fiducia Supplicans (allowing blessings for same-sex couples) highlights tensions between pastoral outreach and doctrinal purity. Role of Women : Calls for greater inclusion, including possibilities like women deacons , are gaining momentum. Clerical Celibacy and Bioethics : Sensitive discussions on evolving traditional stances are expected.

Sarvam AI Selected to Build India\u2019s First Homegrown Sovereign AI Model April 27, 2025 Why in the News? The government has selected Bengaluru-based start-up Sarvam to build the country\u2019s first indigenous artificial intelligence (AI) large language model (LLM) amid waves made by China\u2019s low cost model DeepSeek. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? India\u2019s Sovereign AI Model (Introduction, About Sarvam AI Model, Variants, Significance, Challenges, Future Prospects) Introduction In a landmark move to bolster India\u2019s strategic autonomy in artificial intelligence (AI), Bengaluru-based start-up Sarvam AI has been selected to build the country\u2019s first homegrown sovereign large language model (LLM). The project, undertaken under the government\u2019s ambitious \u20b910,370 crore IndiaAI Mission , aims to create a robust AI infrastructure fully developed, deployed, and optimized within India. This development marks a critical step toward ensuring India\u2019s leadership in the AI domain and promoting domestic innovation through indigenous capabilities. About the Sarvam AI Model Initiative The government chose Sarvam after a rigorous selection process involving 67 applicants. The start-up will receive extensive support, including access to 4,000 high-end GPUs for six months to build the model from scratch\u200b. The GPUs will be provided through companies such as Yotta Data Services, Tata Communications, and E2E Networks, which were separately empanelled to create AI data centres in India\u200b. The model, to be built entirely using local talent and infrastructure, will have 70 billion parameters , positioning it to compete with some of the best global AI models. According to Sarvam, the LLM will focus on advanced reasoning , voice-based tasks , and fluency in Indian languages , making it uniquely suited for India's diverse population\u200b\u200b. Model Variants Under Development Sarvam AI plans to develop three key variants of its LLM\u200b: Sarvam-Large : Designed for advanced reasoning and complex generation tasks. Sarvam-Small : A lightweight model optimized for real-time interactive applications. Sarvam-Edge : A compact model tailored for on-device processing, enabling AI capabilities on mobile and IoT devices. These variants aim to cater to a wide range of applications, from citizen services to enterprise solutions, ensuring adaptability across various use cases. Strategic Significance of the Project This initiative goes beyond technological advancement; it is a strategic move to establish critical national AI infrastructure . The company emphasized that the goal is to create multi-modal, multi-scale foundation models that are not just functional but deeply integrated with Indian languages and societal needs\u200b\u200b. For citizens, this means AI systems that feel familiar and culturally relevant. For enterprises, it unlocks the potential to harness AI capabilities without concerns over data sovereignty, as all processes will remain within India's borders. The IndiaAI Mission and National AI Infrastructure The IndiaAI Mission , approved by the Union Cabinet, is focused on scaling India's AI ecosystem by investing in compute capacity, skilled research talent, datasets, AI applications, and trusted AI practices\u200b. One of its key initiatives is the IndiaAI Compute Capacity program , which aims to deploy over 10,000 GPUs to democratize access to AI resources for startups, researchers, and institutions. To facilitate greater participation, especially by smaller companies, the government has also eased eligibility norms for accessing these resources, offering GPU services at globally competitive subsidized rates\u200b. Sarvam\u2019s selection to develop the first sovereign AI model exemplifies the mission\u2019s objective of nurturing homegrown champions capable of competing on the global stage. Challenges and Opportunities Ahead While the opportunity is historic, building a population-scale LLM is a complex challenge. It demands seamless integration of vast datasets , engineering innovations to handle diverse languages and dialects, and fine-tuning for cultural and contextual understanding. Additionally, unlike some global LLMs that are open-sourced, Sarvam\u2019s model is expected to be closely managed and fine-tuned specifically for Indian use cases \u200b. This positions it as a secure and specialized alternative in an era where data privacy and localized solutions are paramount. Future Prospects Sarvam\u2019s success could unlock a universe of possibilities, from enabling AI-driven citizen services in rural areas to building enterprise-grade AI applications with localized intelligence. It sets the foundation for India to not merely consume global AI solutions but to become a co-creator and leader in AI innovation. With investments from prominent venture capitalists\u200b, Sarvam is well-resourced to deliver on this ambitious national mission. newspaper.pdf ( Size: 215.2 KB ) Latest Article See All IndiGo Meltdown Dec. 5, 2025, 2:34 p.m. Economics India to ", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

Modernising India\u2019s Education System: Government\u2019s Push for 21st Century Readiness April 30, 2025 Why in the News? Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that the government is modernising the country\u2019s education system to meet the needs of the 21st century. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Educational Reforms (Introduction, Driving Forces, Key Interventions, Research & Innovation, Global Engagement, etc.) Introduction India is undergoing a significant transformation in its education landscape, with the government taking proactive steps to modernise the system in alignment with global standards and the needs of a rapidly evolving knowledge economy. Addressing the first-ever YUGM Innovation Conclave held at Bharat Mandapam, New Delhi, PM Modi reaffirmed the government\u2019s commitment to creating a dynamic, inclusive, and future-ready education ecosystem. The centre piece of this transformation is the New Education Policy (NEP) , which aims to equip India\u2019s youth with the skills, resources, and mindset necessary to make the country a global innovation hub. Driving Forces Behind Education Reform At the heart of this reform initiative is the belief that India\u2019s future depends on its youth , and preparing them for global competitiveness is crucial. The government\u2019s approach encompasses three key elements: Talent, Technology, and Temperament , which together form the trinity envisioned to drive India\u2019s ascent on the world stage. The NEP, introduced in 2020 and continuously refined, has become the cornerstone of this vision. From curriculum redesign to technological integration , the focus is on transforming Indian classrooms, research spaces, and learning ecosystems to meet international benchmarks. Key Interventions and Infrastructure Development National Curriculum Framework and School Reforms The development of new textbooks and teaching-learning materials for Classes 1 to 7 under the National Curriculum Framework represents a foundational shift. The framework prioritises conceptual clarity, experiential learning, and multilingual education, addressing the diversity of India's learners. Higher Education Expansion The government has committed to increasing seats and capacity in premier institutions such as IITs, and to launching meditech courses in partnership with institutions like AIIMS. These efforts aim to bridge the gap between academia and industry, especially in areas such as biomedical engineering and AI-driven healthcare. Digital Education Infrastructure Under the PM e-Vidya initiative and the DIKSHA platform , a robust digital backbone is being developed to enable \u2018One Nation, One Digital Education Infrastructure\u2019 . Educational content is now being created in over 30 Indian languages and seven foreign languages , enhancing accessibility and equity across socio-economic groups. Empowering Research and Innovation Research Parks and R&D Cells India\u2019s research ecosystem has witnessed significant growth. Since 2014, the number of operational research parks has grown from 3 to 9, with 13 more planned. Nearly 6,000 higher education institutions now house Research and Development Cells , encouraging a research-driven academic culture. National Research Foundation The proposed Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) will play a central role in promoting frontier research. With the Gross Expenditure on R&D (GERD) doubling from \u20b960,000 crore in 2013-14 to \u20b91.25 lakh crore, India is signalling a shift from rote-based education to a discovery-driven model. Innovation and Commercialisation To shorten the gap between idea, prototype, and product , the government is actively facilitating lab-to-market transitions . This includes catalysing public-private-academic partnerships and encouraging youth-led innovation, making university campuses the new epicentres of transformative ideas. Global Engagement and Academic Mobility India is not only transforming education domestically but also internationalising its institutions . Campuses of IIT Delhi in Abu Dhabi, IIT Madras in Tanzania, and upcoming plans for IIM Ahmedabad in Dubai signal India\u2019s academic footprint going global. Simultaneously, top foreign universities are being invited to establish campuses in India, enhancing cross-border knowledge flows. Access to World-Class Knowledge The \u2018One Nation, One Subscription\u2019 initiative ensures that Indian students and researchers can access top-tier research journals without institutional barriers. This initiative aims to democratise academic access and foster a culture of continuous learning. India\u2019s AI Ambitions in Education Aligning with the larger IndiaAI Mission , the government is also investing in AI-based educational infrastructure . The objective is to leverage AI not just for administrative efficiency but to personalise learning , predict skill gaps , and transform pedagogy across education levels.

Kashmir, Terrorism, and India's Long-Term Security Strategy April 30, 2025 Context: Recent terrorist attacks on tourists in Pahalgam , Jammu and Kashmir, highlight the persistent threat from Pakistan\u2019s deep state. The attack is part of Pakistan's attempts to derail democratic normalcy and development in the region. Lessons for India: Historical parallels: America\u2019s strategic myopia: America evacuated its personnel from the roof of its Saigon embassy via helicopter (on 30 April, 1975) and lost a proxy war in Vietnam . End of soft separatism in J&K: Same year, Sheikh Abdullah returned to democratic politics in J&K (as the elected CM of J&K), ending 22 years of soft separatism. Modern misjudgments - Trump and Munir: Trump\u2019s proposal to \u201c empty Gaza \u201d (to make it a Mediterranean Florida) ignores historical lessons. Pakistan Army Chief Asif Munir echoed outdated ideas - Jinnah's two-nation theory and Z.A. Bhutto\u2019s \" jugular vein \" rhetoric on Kashmir. Both ignore India\u2019s institutional strength, strategic autonomy, and economic rise . Three Pillars of India\u2019s Long-Term Kashmir Strategy: Specialisation - Targeted security operations: Intelligence-driven operations led to the formation of Rashtriya Rifles (1990) and Special Operations Groups (1993). Replacement of BSF with CRPF (1995) and CBI with NIA for counter-terror financing shows institutional adaptability. Moderation - Minimum use of force: India followed a path opposite to the US's \"search and destroy\" in Vietnam. Strategy rooted in public order with minimal resistance, echoing Subrata Mitra's \u201c Governance by Stealth \u201d. Symbols of legitimacy: Surrender of terrorists at Hazratbal (1993), state election voting lines (2024). Democracy - Civil participation in conflict zones: Frequent elections , civil service involvement, and respecting political diversity, even those who espoused soft separatism. Reflects a deeper commitment to democratic processes versus Pakistan\u2019s unstable governance (no PM completing a full term since 1947). Killings Signal Pakistan\u2019s Desperation: India\u2019s evolving strategy - abrogation of Article 370 , cross-border strikes, strategic autonomy, and infrastructure development (e.g., railways) - is yielding results. Terrorist attacks are a reaction to India\u2019s success in integrating J&K , not a sign of weakness. Message from Kashmir: Kashmiris: After the murders at Baisaran (Pahalgam, J&K), Kashmiris are on streets blaming Pakistan for the attack. Security forces of India: 1,608 J&K police, 511 CRPF, and hundreds of army personnel\u2019s supreme sacrifice in protecting J&K depicts that \u201cThe flag does not flutter in the wind, but with the last breath of martyrs.\u201d So, \u201c Veer Bhogya Vasundhara \u201d (The brave shall inherit the earth) is the symbolic message from the forces. Conclusion - Strategic Resolve over Reaction: India's response must be seen not as war-mongering but as measured, courageous defence of peace. The world must draw lessons from India\u2019s experience: institutional resilience, democratic depth, and calibrated security actions.

The Real Indian Arbitrator Needs to Stand Up April 28, 2025 Context India\u2019s economic ascent has been accompanied by intensified discussions regarding its arbitration framework\u2019s potential to contribute meaningfully to the country\u2019s commercial growth. As cross-border and domestic commerce flourish, the inevitability of commercial disputes has become evident. However, India\u2019s traditional court-litigation system , burdened by overwhelming caseloads and inefficiency, struggles to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving economic landscape. These discussions often highlight legislative reforms and judicial restraint but overlook a crucial factor, the role of arbitrators, the most significant stakeholders in the arbitration ecosystem. The Importance of Human Capital in Arbitration The success of any legal or dispute-resolution mechanism is determined not only by its theoretical or structural framework but also by the quality of its human capital. In the case of Indian arbitration, this human capital encompasses a community of arbitration lawyers and, even more crucially, arbitrators themselves, who serve as decision-makers in the process. The credibility and legitimacy of Indian arbitration are largely dependent on two critical parameters: the efficient conduct of arbitral proceedings and the quality of arbitral awards. In both aspects, the arbitrator\u2019s role is central. While arbitration lawyers significantly influence proceedings, it is the arbitrators who ultimately govern procedural rules, set timelines, resolve procedural disputes , and penalise improper conduct. Their decisions, the arbitral awards, are the final products that parties may choose to accept or challenge in courts worldwide. Thus, arbitrators form the backbone of India\u2019s arbitration environment and are essential to its success on the global stage. The Neglected Discussion in Indian Arbitration: Building Elite Indian Arbitrators Despite their pivotal role, arbitrators rarely feature in the mainstream discourse on improving Indian arbitration. While numerous initiatives focus on expanding the arbitration bar, comparable efforts to strengthen the arbitration bench are notably absent. This omission is particularly concerning in light of observations by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud , the former Chief Justice of India, who recently questioned the absence of Indian arbitrators in purely international disputes. The marginalisation of Indian arbitrators on the global stage stems from a deep-rooted trend : the identification of elite Indian arbitrators primarily with retired judges of the Supreme Court or High Courts. It is a common practice in India, especially for high-value disputes, to prefer retired judges as arbitrators, assuming that their judicial experience naturally ensures procedural efficiency and well-reasoned awards. However, this assumption has been increasingly challenged. In June 2024, guidelines issued by the Ministry of Finance painted a grim picture of arbitration proceedings in India , highlighting their resemblance to protracted court procedures, their inefficiency, and the frequent setting aside of poorly reasoned awards. Clearly, judicial experience alone does not automatically translate into effective arbitration. The skills required to manage arbitral proceedings and deliver high-quality awards differ substantially from those needed in traditional courtroom litigation. Requirement to Become a Proficient Arbitrator Skills Beyond the Courtroom The transition from a judicial to an arbitral mindset demands a reorientation of skills and approaches. A proficient arbitrator must be not only legally sound but also an adept manager of proceedings , balancing procedural certainty with innovation and flexibility, hallmarks of modern arbitration. Unlike litigation, where rigid rules of civil procedure and evidence dominate, international arbitration demands familiarity with best practices that are often more flexible, efficient, and party-centric. Ability to Collaborate with Diverse Legal Systems Additionally, in international settings, arbitrators often collaborate with colleagues from diverse legal systems and cultural backgrounds. Successfully navigating such multi-national panels requires refined soft skills , including negotiation, persuasion, and cross-cultural sensitivity, competencies not automatically imparted through judicial service. Specialised Skills in Evidence Management Finally, the drafting of an arbitral award demands a different methodology compared to writing a court judgment. Arbitral awards typically involve a detailed examination of extensive documentary evidence , expert and fact-witness testimony, and sophisticated financial analysis. Arbitrators must, therefore, possess specialised skills in evidence management , fact-finding, and damage quantification, areas that require dedicated training.

CSR Spending in India Sees 16% Growth in FY24: HDFC Bank, Reliance Lead the Charge April 28, 2025 Why in the News? Funds spent by listed companies on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) rose by 16% to Rs 17,967 crore in 2023-24, in comparison to 2022-23. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? About CSR (Meaning, Objective, etc.) CSR Spending in FY24 (Statistics, Leading Contributors, Sectoral Allocation, Trends, etc.) About Corporate Social Responsibility: CSR has become a central pillar of India's corporate governance framework. Enacted through the Companies Act, 2013 and enforced from April 2014, CSR mandates eligible companies to spend at least 2% of their average net profits over the preceding three years on socially impactful initiatives. Companies with a net worth of \u20b9500 crore or more , turnover of \u20b91,000 crore or more , or net profit of \u20b95 crore or more are obligated to undertake CSR activities. The intent behind the CSR mandate is twofold : to ensure that businesses contribute meaningfully to society, and to embed social responsibility as an integral part of corporate strategy. Over the years, CSR in India has expanded to include areas like education, healthcare, rural development, environmental sustainability, and cultural heritage. While compliance levels have consistently improved, recent trends suggest an evolving landscape where corporates are increasingly aligning their CSR strategies with sustainable development goals and national priorities. Rise in CSR Spending in FY24 In the financial year 2023-24, India witnessed a 16% surge in CSR spending , with listed companies investing a total of \u20b917,967 crore , up from \u20b915,524 crore in FY23\u200b\u200b. This significant rise mirrors the 18% increase in average three-year net profits , which grew to \u20b99.62 lakh crore from \u20b98.14 lakh crore\u200b. As per the CSR mandate, companies were required to spend \u20b918,309 crore. The slight shortfall between required and actual spending was due to \u20b92,329 crore being transferred to Unspent CSR Accounts for future utilization\u200b. This increase in spending came after three years of relatively flat growth, signalling a strong corporate commitment towards social welfare, driven by regulatory push and profit expansion. Sectoral Allocation of CSR Funds CSR funds were predominantly directed towards key societal needs: Education remained the top priority, attracting \u20b91,104 crore. Healthcare followed closely, receiving \u20b9720 crore\u200b\u200b. Notably, spending on environmental sustainability saw the steepest increase, with a 54% growth compared to the previous year. Meanwhile, areas like slum development (-72%), rural development (-59%), and armed forces veterans\u2019 welfare (-52%) witnessed significant declines\u200b. This sectoral shift indicates a growing awareness and responsiveness among corporates towards environmental challenges and the sustainable development agenda. Trends in Compliance and Governance Corporate compliance with CSR norms continued to remain robust: 98% of the 1,394 eligible companies fulfilled their CSR obligations\u200b. Around 49% of the companies exceeded their mandated spending, reflecting a proactive approach. Only 259 companies fell short of the spending requirement, mainly due to multi-year project planning\u200b. Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) also enhanced their contribution, with 66 PSUs spending \u20b93,717 crore , marking a 19% increase from the previous year\u200b. Governance around CSR has also improved . Companies spending over \u20b950 lakh must form a CSR Committee comprising at least three directors, including one independent director. Among the 1,028 companies mandated to set up committees, 990 had fully compliant structures \u200b. Call for Revising CSR Thresholds Given the significant rise in average corporate profits over past decade, experts have called for a revision of CSR eligibility thresholds . The original thresholds were set when the average three-year net profit was \u20b94.18 lakh crore; now it has more than doubled to \u20b99.62 lakh crore. Revising these limits would help focus CSR mandates on larger entities and ease regulatory burdens on smaller companies. Future Outlook As India's economy grows, CSR is expected to evolve from being a compliance obligation to a strategic pillar for brand building, social impact, and stakeholder trust. Emerging focus areas are likely to include: Climate change mitigation Digital inclusion Skilling for the future workforce Healthcare innovations Greater integration of CSR initiatives with corporate business strategies and national development programs will further enhance their effectiveness and impact.

Teaching Children to Eat Well Must Begin in School April 26, 2025 Context The global fight against malnutrition took a significant leap forward at the recent Nutrition for Growth (N4G) Summit held in Paris, where world leaders gathered to reaffirm their commitment to ending all forms of malnutrition. Coinciding with this summit, the United Nations General Assembly extended the Decade of Action on Nutrition to 2030, reinforcing alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). While past efforts have focused heavily on access to food and early childhood nutrition, a growing global consensus is calling for a paradigm shift, one that emphasises nutrition education, particularly for school-aged children and adolescents. Nutrition Education: From Awareness to Action One of the key takeaways from the N4G Summit\u2019s side event, \u2018Learn to Eat Well: Bio-diverse Diets and Youth as Agents of Change,\u2019 was the call to embed nutrition education in schools. This education must transcend calorie counting and include lessons on how to make informed, sustainable, and culturally respectful food choices. In today\u2019s fast-paced, convenience-driven food landscape, where processed foods are easily accessible and aggressively marketed, such education is more important than ever. The Crisis of Dietary Diversity and Rethinking the Focus on Nutrition The Crisis of Dietary Diversity A major casualty of modern food systems is dietary diversity. Despite the UN\u2019s adoption of Minimum Dietary Diversity as an indicator under SDG 2, many children still fail to consume even five of ten essential food groups daily. This dietary inadequacy is not confined to impoverished region s but is also prevalent in urban centres, indicating systemic issues in both food access and education. Poor diets contribute not only to malnutrition and obesity but also to chronic illnesses and mental health challenges. Alarmingly, research suggests that 70% of preventable adult diseases originate from childhood habits, underlining the urgency of early and sustained intervention. Rethinking the Focus on Nutrition Historically, nutrition initiatives have targeted the first 1,000 days of life , from conception to age two, as the most critical period for preventing malnutrition. However, emerging research highlights the importance of the next 4,000 days , including adolescence, a time marked by intense physical and psychological development. Proper nutrition during this period can mitigate early deficits, aid in growth recovery, and lay the foundation for lifelong health. This calls for a shift from simply feeding children to teaching them how and why to eat well. The Missing Link in Schools Despite the critical role schools can play, nutrition education is often absent, outdated, or disconnected from students' lived experiences. Teachers frequently lack the tools and training needed to deliver effective food education. A structured curriculum, beginning from preschool and extending through middle school, could fill this gap. Such a curriculum should explore the relationship between food , the human body, the environment, and cultural identity. Central to this approach is the promotion of bio-diverse diets , those that prioritise local, seasonal, and culturally familiar foods, benefiting not just personal health but also local economies and environmental sustainability. The Way Forward and Opportunities for India Bringing Food Education to Life To be effective, food education must be an immersive part of school life. Weekly lessons, practical experiences like gardening and cooking, healthier canteen options, and student-led campaigns can develop deeper engagement and lasting habits. Around the world, innovative schools are already demonstrating success: students are reading food labels, preparing meals, and understanding the impact of their dietary choices on both personal and planetary health. India\u2019s Opportunity India\u2019s National Education Policy and the School Health and Wellness Programme have laid a foundational framework for integrated nutrition education. Yet, to achieve meaningful change, this framework must evolve into a comprehensive curriculum with consistent implementation, appropriate learning materials, and teacher training. Recognising children as not only learners but also influencers is vital. Equipped with the right knowledge, they can positively impact their families and communities, advocating for healthier meals, reducing food waste, and promoting sustainable practices. Conclusion In a world grappling with the twin challenges of undernutrition and overconsumption , climate change, and cultural erosion, food literacy is no longer optional, it is essential. Teaching children to eat well is about much more than nutrition; it is about cultivating respect for health, heritage, and the environment.

This historical meeting of 29 newly independent Asian and African nations, set the stage for South-South cooperation and laid the foundation of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) . The relevance of the Bandung principles is critical in today\u2019s geopolitical environment - rising global polarisation, erosion of multilateralism, and challenges to the rules-based international order. Bandung\u2019s Core Principles and Objectives: Anti-colonial solidarity: Shared experiences of colonial exploitation and marginalisation. Common goals: Principles of sovereignty and independent policy making. Collective action in the global south. Key principles adopted: Political independence. Mutual respect for sovereignty. Non-aggression and non-interference in internal affairs. Alignment with UN charter: Commitment to a rules-based international order grounded in UN principles. South Africa\u2019s Role and Anti-Apartheid Advocacy: Strategic use of Bandung: Brought global attention to the oppressive apartheid regime in South Africa that governed the country through White minority rule. The African National Congress (ANC) delegation: The ANC was the foremost liberation organisation championing the freedom of the country both within and internationally. It sent two delegates to the conference (Moses Kotane and Maulvi Chachalia) to lobby support internationally for South Africa\u2019s freedom struggle. Challenges to the Multilateral World Order: Erosion of multilateralism: Rise of polarisation and trust deficit among major powers. Emergence of \u201c might is right \u201d as a guiding principle. UN reform crisis: Paralysis of institutions like the UN Security Council. Stalled negotiations on equitable representation and expansion of UNSC membership. PM Narendra Modi\u2019s critique: Described international organisations as \" irrelevant \" due to lack of reform. The Global South - Then and Now: Initial marginalisation: Absence during UN\u2019s formation in 1945; continued exclusion from global decision-making bodies. Bandung legacy: Precursor of the NAM (1961) and G77 (1964). Advocated collective aspirations and a multipolar world. Contemporary relevance and role: Emerging powers: Rise of China, India, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa. South-south institutions: Formation of BRICS as a counterweight to Global North\u2019s dominance. Strategic imperative: Forge new partnerships and alliances. Collaborate with like-minded Global North nations. Champion an inclusive, equitable, just global order .

India Expands its Extended Continental Shelf Claim in the Arabian Sea April 27, 2025 Why in News? India has expanded its Extended Continental Shelf (ECS) claim by nearly 10,000 sq km in the Central Arabian Sea . India has also modified earlier claims to avoid a long-standing maritime boundary dispute with Pakistan. Revised submissions were made in April 2025 to the United Nations' Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS). What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Background - Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and ECS India\u2019s Current Oceanic Claims Dispute with Pakistan and Sir Creek Issue India's Strategic Response - Modified and Partial Claims Overlap with Other Countries - Oman, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka Background - Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and ECS: EEZ: Coastal countries have exclusive rights to mining, fishing, and resources up to 200 nautical miles from their baselines. ECS: Countries can claim additional seabed areas if they can scientifically prove it is a natural extension of their landmass to the CLCS. Rights include commercial mining of polymetallic nodules , oil reserves, and other valuable minerals. India\u2019s Current Oceanic Claims: 12 nautical miles: Territorial Sea. 200 nautical miles: New extension: ~1.2 million sq km of ECS being added to ~2 million sq km EEZ. Combined seabed and sub-seabed area: It would become almost equal to India's land area of 3.274 million sq km. India's first submission to the CLCS: It was made in 2009 covering the Bay of Bengal, Indian Ocean, and Arabian Sea. Dispute with Pakistan and Sir Creek Issue: In 2021 , Pakistan objected to India's claims, citing an overlap of 100 nautical miles near the disputed Sir Creek region. Sir Creek is a disputed tidal estuary between Rann of Kutch in Gujarat and Sindh province (Pakistan). As a result, CLCS rejected India's full claim in the Arabian Sea in March 2023. India's Strategic Response - Modified and Partial Claims: April 3, 2025: India submitted two partial claims to safeguard uncontested regions. This approach avoids weakening India\u2019s position in the valuable Central Arabian Sea region. Govt\u2019s Position: \u201cWe have increased our claim by an additional 10,000 sq km based on new data.\u201d Institutions of the MoES, such as the National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research ( NCPOR, Goa ), have played a key role in the technical aspects of determining India\u2019s continental shelf. Overlap with Other Countries - Oman, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka: Oman: Overlaps exist but not under dispute due to a 2010 agreement. Myanmar and Sri Lanka: India's claims in the Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean (~300,000 sq km) face objections from Myanmar and Sri Lanka. CLCS will begin new consultations later this year on these claims.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted above-normal rainfall of 105% of the long-period average (LPA) for the June-September southwest monsoon season. Key drivers like the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) are favorable for the monsoon. The April 15 forecast is the first of the year, with an updated forecast expected in the last week of May. Long-range forecasts can extend from 30 days to two years. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Early Efforts in Monsoon Forecasting Post-Independence Challenges and the IMD\u2019s Early Forecasting Models Recent Improvements in Monsoon Forecasting Early Efforts in Monsoon Forecasting A systematic effort to forecast monsoon rainfall began in 1877 , following the establishment of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) in 1875. The impetus for this was the Great Famine of 1876-78, which highlighted the critical need to understand monsoon patterns for agriculture, revenue, and public health. British colonial interests, including agricultural production and shipping, relied heavily on the monsoon. Blanford's Contribution (1882-1885) The first tentative forecasts were made by Henry Francis Blanford, who analyzed the relationship between Himalayan snow cover and monsoon rainfall. Blanford\u2019s theory suggested that the extent and thickness of snow in the Himalayas influenced rainfall patterns over India, particularly in northwest regions. Eliot's Advances (1889) Sir John Eliot succeeded Blanford as the first Director General of Indian Observatories in 1889. Eliot expanded on Blanford's work by incorporating data on Himalayan snow, local weather conditions, and factors from the Indian Ocean and Australia. Despite these advancements, Eliot\u2019s forecasts were still unable to predict droughts or famines, such as the devastating Indian Famine of 1899-1900. Sir Gilbert Walker and Global Influences (1904) In 1904, Sir Gilbert Walker succeeded Eliot and made significant advancements by incorporating global atmospheric, land, and ocean parameters. Walker identified 28 predictors with stable historical correlations to the Indian monsoon and identified the Southern Oscillation (SO) as a key global pressure pattern influencing India's climate. SO was later linked to El Ni\u00f1o, which was identified by Jacob Bjerknes in the 1960s. Walker also divided India into three subregions\u2014Peninsula, Northeast, and Northwest\u2014for more accurate forecasts . Post-Independence Challenges and the IMD\u2019s Early Forecasting Models After India\u2019s independence, the IMD continued using Walker\u2019s monsoon forecasting model until 1987, but the forecasts were not very accurate. From 1932 to 1987, the average error in predictions was significant, with errors of 12.33 cm for the peninsula and 9.9 cm for Northwest India. The primary issue was that many of Walker\u2019s parameters had lost their relevance over time, leading to poor accuracy despite attempts to improve the model . Introduction of the Gowariker Model (1988) In 1988, the IMD adopted a new model based on power regression, developed by Vasant R Gowariker and his team. This model used 16 atmospheric variables as predictors in statistical relationships with total rainfall. Forecasts for the entire country replaced regional forecasts, though regional predictions were reintroduced in 1999 with modified geographical boundaries. However, the new model still faced issues, and by 2000, four of the 16 parameters had lost their correlation with the monsoon, requiring adjustments. Failures and Re-evaluation (2000s) The Gowariker model faced significant challenges, including its failure to predict the drought of 2002, which followed 14 years of good monsoons. This failure led to a re-evaluation of the model. In 2003, the IMD introduced two new models based on 8 and 10 parameters, along with a two-stage forecast strategy. While the 2003 forecast was accurate, the models again failed to predict the 2004 drought, prompting further refinement. Development of the Statistical Forecasting System (2007) In 2007, the IMD introduced a Statistical Ensemble Forecasting System (SEFS) to support its two-stage forecasting strategy. This new system reduced the number of parameters in the models, replacing the eight-parameter model with a five-parameter model for the first forecast and the ten-parameter model with a six-parameter model for the update. The aim was to avoid \"overfitting,\" ensuring the models could accurately predict new data. The IMD also implemented ensemble forecasting, which combined all possible forecasting models based on different predictor combinations to generate a more robust prediction. This new approach significantly improved the accuracy of monsoon forecasts, with the average error decreasing from 7.94% of the long-period average (LPA) between 1995 and 2006 to 5.95% of LPA between 2007 and 2018.

India Considers Allowing 49% Foreign Investment in Nuclear Power Plants April 26, 2025 Why in the News? The Indian government is contemplating permitting foreign firms to acquire up to 49% ownership in nuclear power facilities, according to three government officials. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? India\u2019s Nuclear Energy Landscape (Background, Proposal, Key Features, Significance, etc.) Introduction India is preparing for a major shift in its energy strategy by considering allowing up to 49% foreign investment in its nuclear power sector. This landmark move aims to strengthen the country\u2019s clean energy capacity, reduce dependency on coal, and contribute significantly to carbon emission reduction goals. If implemented, it would mark the first time India opens its tightly controlled nuclear energy sector to substantial foreign participation. Background: India\u2019s Nuclear Energy Landscape Nuclear energy plays a relatively small but strategic role in India's electricity mix, currently contributing just over 8 GW, roughly 2% of the installed capacity . India's nuclear energy infrastructure is governed strictly by state-owned entities under the Atomic Energy Act of 1960 , with no provision for private or foreign ownership till now. In 2008, India signed a civil nuclear agreement with the United States, opening doors for billion-dollar deals with American firms. However, concerns over the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act of 2010 , particularly regarding unlimited liability during accidents, deterred foreign participation. Key Features of the Proposed Move Allowing 49% Foreign Investment The proposed policy will permit foreign companies to own up to 49% equity in nuclear power plants. This foreign ownership would not be automatic; it would require prior government approval to ensure stringent scrutiny. Legal Amendments To facilitate this change, the government plans to amend two critical legislations: The Atomic Energy Act, 1960 : To allow private sector companies to build, own, and operate nuclear plants and engage in atomic fuel mining and manufacturing. The Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act, 2010 : To modify liability norms that have been major deterrents for foreign and private investments. The draft proposals are expected to be tabled before the federal cabinet soon, with an aim to pass the amendments during the Parliament\u2019s monsoon session in July 2025. Private Sector Participation Besides foreign firms, Indian private conglomerates like Reliance Industries, Tata Power, Adani Power, and Vedanta have also shown interest. Together, they are discussing potential investments amounting to around $26 billion in the nuclear sector . Strategic Importance of the Decision Meeting Carbon Reduction Goals India\u2019s pledge to reduce carbon emissions and achieve net-zero emissions by 2070 relies heavily on expanding its clean energy portfolio. Expanding nuclear energy capacity is crucial, especially to meet night-time electricity demands when solar and wind energy are insufficient. Target: 100 GW Nuclear Capacity by 2047 The government aims to expand nuclear energy capacity from around 8 GW today to 100 GW by 2047 , a 12-fold increase. This ambitious target underscores the urgency behind liberalizing the nuclear energy sector. Boosting Global Cooperation The move could facilitate deeper energy partnerships with countries like the United States, France, and Russia. Foreign firms such as Westinghouse Electric, GE-Hitachi, Electricit\u00e9 de France (EDF), and Rosatom have expressed interest in participating as technology suppliers, contractors, or service providers. Safeguards and Regulatory Control Despite the opening up, stringent regulatory oversight will continue. Foreign investments will require case-by-case government approvals, and the core principles of nuclear non-proliferation and safety will remain uncompromised. Conclusion India\u2019s plan to allow 49% foreign investment in nuclear power plants represents a historic transformation of the sector. By inviting global expertise and capital, India is not only addressing its urgent energy and environmental needs but also strengthening its strategic partnerships. While the move faces legislative and regulatory hurdles, it signals India's determination to align its energy policy with its climate and growth ambitions. newspaper.pdf ( Size: 269.3 KB ) Latest Article See All IndiGo Meltdown Dec. 5, 2025, 2:34 p.m. Economics India to Expand Its Busiest Rail Corridors: What\u2019s Planned Dec. 5, 2025, 2:08 p.m. Economics Census 2027 - Counting India, Renewing the Republic Dec. 5, 2025, 1:54 p.m. Editorial Analysis Health and National Security Cess on Demerit Goods Dec. 5, 2025, 1:48 p.m. Economics A Missing Link in India\u2019s Mineral Mission Dec. 5, 2025, 1:33 p.m. Editorial Analysis A Day to Pause and Come Down to Earth Dec. 5, 2025, 1:27 p.m. Editorial Analysis Rupee Breaches the 90-Mark Dec. 4, 2025, 1:36 p.m. Economics Putin\u2019s Visit: In", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

The \u2018Political Trilemma\u2019 and the Crisis in the West April 28, 2025 Context In recent years, democracies across the Western world have faced an escalating crisis. Marked by deepening political polarisation , growing mistrust in democratic institutions, and the rise of populism, these societies are increasingly turning inward. This phenomenon, although alarming, was foreseen in economic theory. Economist Dani Rodrik\u2019s political trilemma, proposed over two decades ago, provides a powerful lens through which to understand these unfolding developments. Rodrik\u2019s Political Trilemma: Theoretical Foundations In his influential 2000 paper, How Far Will International Economic Integration Go? Rodrik highlighted three objectives of countries. Rodrik argued that countries could, at most, achieve two of the following three objectives simultaneously : deep international economic integration (globalisation), national sovereignty, and mass politics (popular democracy). Pursuing all three together, Rodrik contended, would eventually result in unsustainable tensions. Despite the strong rhetoric around globalisation, he observed that national barriers to free trade and economic integration had persisted due to transaction costs and protectionist policies, suggesting an inherent limit to how globalised the world could become. Rodrik\u2019s once-theoretical framework is now being visibly manifested in the political and economic struggles of Western democracies. The ongoing crisis highlights the contradictions between the three goals and the grave consequences of attempting to balance them all. From Theory to Reality: The Western Experience Reality of Globalisation The first configuration Rodrik identifies is the combination of globalisation and popular democracy, achieved at the cost of national sovereignty . The European Union (EU) exemplifies this model. EU member states have ceded significant control over monetary policy , trade, and migration to a supranational body to benefit from economic integration. While the EU has created a vast single market and boasts impressive economic output, it has also generated resentment among segments of the population. Many citizens feel economically marginalised or culturally threatened by policies that facilitate free movement and open borders. This discontent has fuelled nationalist backlashes, most dramatically witnessed in Brexit and the rise of far-right political parties across Europe , showcasing the fragility of this configuration. The Issue of National Sovereignty The second option involves maintaining globalisation and national sovereignty while sidelining mass politics. This results in governance by technocratic institutions insulated from public opinion . Central banks and regulatory authorities often operate independently to prioritise market confidence over popular welfare. However, this arrangement risks both democratic disengagement and national sovereignty , as global markets exert significant influence. The experience of countries like Kenya, where IMF-imposed austerity measures provoked widespread public anger, illustrates the societal tensions that arise when global financial interests override domestic priorities. Bretton Woods Compromise The third path, known as the Bretton Woods compromise, preserves national sovereignty and democracy while limiting globalisation. Countries like India have adopted protectionist policies and industrial strategies to foster domestic growth while regulating foreign investment and influence. China and the East Asian Tigers pursued controlled globalisation, allowing selective integration while maintaining political control. While this model has delivered robust economic growth, it often comes at the cost of individual freedoms and political dissent , presenting a different set of trade-offs. The Western Crisis: An Unattainable Balance The predicament facing Western democracies stems from a persistent attempt to achieve all three goals simultaneously. For decades, policymakers believed that open markets, national self-determination, and vibrant democracy could coexist harmoniously. However, globalisation has produced uneven outcomes , creating winners and losers within societies. Manufacturing industries in the U.S., the U.K., and Europe have declined , leaving once-thriving communities economically vulnerable. These economic dislocations have been fertile ground for populist leaders like Donald Trump, Geert Wilders, and Viktor Orb\u00e1n , who capitalised on grievances against globalisation, immigration, and political elites. As traditional political parties and institutions lose public trust, populist movements advocate protectionism, tighter immigration controls, and disengagement from global cooperative efforts such as climate change initiatives. In doing so, they offer a nationalist alternative but further deepen societal divisions and threaten democratic norms.

{"id": "9262c7fd-7709-413b-ab86-c14b8f42570d", "text": "Home / Mains Articles / The Post of Deputy Spe... The Post of Deputy Speaker is Not Symbolic or Optional April 29, 2025 Context The Office of the Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha , enshrined within the Constitution of India, holds far more than ceremonial significance. Mandated by Article 93, it is a constitutional imperative designed to ensure the seamless functioning of the lower House of Parliament. However, a disturbing trend has emerged in recent years, the persistent vacancy of this vital office , posing serious questions about constitutional adherence and democratic resilience. Constitutional Mandate and Historical Significance Constitutional Mandate Article 93 of the Indian Constitution unequivocally demands that the House of the People shall, as soon as may be, choose two members of the House to be respectively Speaker and Deputy Speaker. The language used, particularly the phrase as soon as may be, implies urgency and necessity, not discretion. Furthermore , Article 94 reinforces the continuity of the Deputy Speaker\u2019s office until resignation , removal, or disqualification. Thus, the framers intended for no disruption in leadership, safeguarding the stability of parliamentary proceedings . Historical Significance The roots of this office extend back to colonial India , when it was known as the Deputy President of the Central Legislative Assembly. Sachidanand Sinha\u2019s appointment in 1921 marked the institutional beginning of this role. Post-independence, the Constituent Assembly deliberately continued this office, recognising its indispensable contribution to parliamentary democracy. Notably, M.A. Ayyangar\u2019s seamless transition to Acting Speaker following Speaker G.V. Mavalankar\u2019s sudden demise in 1956 demonstrated the practical necessity and importance of the Deputy Speaker as a ready and capable leader. Role and Relevance in Parliamentary Functioning While the Speaker is the primary presiding authority, no individual can personally oversee every minute of legislative business. As constitutional expert S.C. Kashyap observed, the Speaker\u2019s responsibilities are too vast to allow for continuous chairing of sessions. The Deputy Speaker, therefore, plays an indispensable role in maintaining the continuity of legislative work. Moreover, the Deputy Speaker\u2019s responsibilities extend beyond substitution. They preside over committees, oversee crucial debates, and serve as neutral arbiters during sensitive discussions. Once elected, the Deputy Speaker, like the Speaker, is expected to act impartially , setting aside partisan loyalties to uphold parliamentary decorum. An equally important convention has been the informal practice of offering the Deputy Speaker\u2019s post to a member of the Opposition. Although not legally mandated, this tradition has served to develop bipartisanship, moderation, and trust across the political aisle , values critical to the health of a parliamentary democracy. A Growing Constitutional Vacuum Despite the constitutional clarity and historical precedents, the office of the Deputy Speaker has remained vacant throughout the tenure of the 17th Lok Sabha (2019\u20132024) and, as of now, the newly constituted 18th Lok Sabha as well. This is an unprecedented dereliction. Though the Constitution does not impose a strict timeline, interpreting \"as soon as may be\" to permit years-long delay is a distortion of constitutional intent. The absence of a Deputy Speaker centralises procedural authority in the hands of the ruling establishment , disrupting the delicate institutional balance envisioned by the framers. In events of sudden crises , such as the resignation, incapacitation, or death of the Speaker, the lack of a designated second-in-command could cause confusion and paralyze the House\u2019s functioning. Additionally, the failure to uphold the tradition of offering the office to the Opposition undermines the spirit of consensus-driven politics and erodes democratic goodwill. It signals not mere oversight but an active sidelining of constitutional morality and parliamentary conventions. The Way Forward: Towards Legislative Reform and Democratic Renewal This prolonged vacancy invites the urgent question: should the Constitution be amended to introduce a strict deadline for the election of the Deputy Speaker? For instance, mandating that the post be filled within 60 days of the first sitting of a new Lok Sabha could reinforce compliance and ensure continuity. Alternatively, a statutory intervention could empower the President, upon advice from the Prime Minister or Speaker, to initiate the election process if the House fails to act within a stipulated time frame. Either measure would close the dangerous loophole of indefinite delay that currently undermines institutional integrity. Ultimately, the Office of the Deputy Speaker is neither symbolic nor dispensable . It is a constitutional safeguard, a critical cog in the machinery of India\u2019s parliamentary democracy.

The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has released the Draft Greenhouse Gases Emissions Intensity (GEI) Target Rules, 2025 . These rules set emission reduction targets for \"obligated entities\" in energy-intensive sectors and establish a compliance mechanism under the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS), 2023 . The CCTS aims to enable carbon credit trading to reduce emissions and support India\u2019s climate goals under the 2015 Paris Agreement. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) Greenhouse Gases Emissions Intensity (GEI) Summary of Draft GEI Target Rules Draft Rules Tie into India\u2019s Carbon Credit Trading Scheme Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) GHGs are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, contributing to the \"greenhouse effect\" and raising Earth's surface temperature. The five most abundant GHGs are water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Other GHGs include synthetic gases like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). Greenhouse Gases Emissions Intensity (GEI) GEI refers to the amount of GHGs emitted per unit of product output, such as emissions per tonne of cement, aluminium, or paper produced. Definitions under the Draft Rules GEI Definition : The Draft Greenhouse Gases Emissions Intensity (GEI) Target Rules, 2025, define GEI as \"greenhouse gases emission intensity in tCO\u2082e/ equivalent output or product.\" tCO\u2082e Meaning : tCO\u2082e (tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent) is the standard unit used to measure the warming impact of all GHGs. Summary of Draft GEI Target Rules Baseline Emissions & Reduction Targets Establishes 2023-24 as the baseline year for emissions. Gradual GHG reduction targets set for 2025-26 and 2026-27. Part of India's Carbon Credits Trading Scheme, 2023. Industries & Entities Covered Applies to energy-intensive industries: Aluminium \u2013 13 plants Cement \u2013 186 plants Pulp & Paper \u2013 53 plants Chlor-Alkali \u2013 30 plants Total of 282 industrial units affected. Major Companies Assigned Targets Includes leading corporations such as: Vedanta, Hindalco, Bharat Aluminium, SW Cement, Ultratech, Nalco, JK Cement, Dalmia Cement, Shree Cement, Grasim Industries, and JK Paper. Compliance & Penalties Rules define compliance mechanisms for industries. Penalties prescribed for non-compliance with reduction targets. Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) 2023 and Its Importance Foundation: The PAT Scheme (Since 2012) PAT (Perform, Achieve, Trade) was launched in 2012 to enhance energy efficiency. It set energy consumption reduction targets for selected energy-intensive industries. Companies achieving more than their targets earned Energy Saving Certificates ( ESCerts ), which could be traded with those who underperformed. Evolution: Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS), 2023 CCTS builds upon the PAT scheme, expanding the focus from energy efficiency to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction. It introduces GHG emissions intensity (GEI) reduction targets specific to industries. Why Industry-Specific Targets Matter Critical to achieving India\u2019s climate goals and low-carbon growth. Helps industries reduce, remove, or avoid GHG emissions. Example: Cement plants can lower emissions by using biomass instead of coal or adopting energy-efficient kilns. Alignment with International Commitments Supports India\u2019s Paris Agreement pledge: Reduce emissions intensity of GDP by 45% by 2030 (compared to 2005 levels). Encourages the adoption of sustainable and advanced technologies in high-emission sectors. Key Objective Drive systemic change in emission-heavy industries by integrating climate action with industrial growth. How do these Draft Rules Tie into India\u2019s Carbon Credit Trading Scheme? Framework of the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) CCTS establishes a system for generating, trading, and utilizing carbon credit certificates. Inspired by Article 17 of the Kyoto Protocol, which allowed trading of unused emission units among countries. Role of GEI Targets in Carbon Credit Generation GHG Emission Intensity (GEI) targets clearly define goals for industries. Industries must prepare action plans to achieve these targets. Carbon credits are awarded to industries that reduce their emissions intensity. Trading and Compliance Mechanism The trade mainly revolves around carbon dioxide, the principal GHG. Carbon credits are traded on the Indian Carbon Market platform. Oversight by: Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), Union Ministry of Power. Industries falling short must either: Buy credits to cover the gap, or Face penalties imposed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Incentives for Industries Availability of carbon credits motivates industries to decarbonize. Resource-rich industries can adopt clean technologies and profit from surplus credits. Resource-constrained industries can transition gradually by purchasing credits.

The Strategic Importance of Crimea Context of Crimea in the Current War Donald Trump\u2019s Proposal on Crimea The Strategic Importance of Crimea Geographic Significance Crimea holds immense strategic value due to its location, benefiting both from its own geography and that of Russia. Russia\u2019s Historical Quest for Warm Water Ports Most of Russia\u2019s coastline lies in the Arctic region, making many ports unusable during winter. Hence, gaining access to warm water ports has been a long-standing goal of Russian foreign policy. Black Sea \u2013 Russia\u2019s Gateway to the Mediterranean The Black Sea provides Russia with its warmest waters and the only direct maritime access to the Mediterranean via the Turkish-controlled Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits . Control of these straits has historically been viewed as critical to Russia\u2019s economic and military interests. Sevastopol \u2013 The Naval Stronghold Unlike other shallow Black Sea ports, Sevastopol in Crimea is a deep-water port ideal for hosting the Black Sea Fleet . It has been central to Russia\u2019s maritime strategy since the 18th century and became a focal point in post-Soviet tensions with Ukraine. Post-Soviet Disputes and Agreements After the Soviet Union's collapse, the 1997 Kharkiv Pact allowed Russia to retain its naval base in Sevastopol, even though Crimea was part of Ukraine. This lease was extended until 2042, but Russia unilaterally ended the agreement during its 2014 annexation of Crimea. Context of Crimea in the Current War 2014 Political Upheaval and Russian Annexation After the ousting of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014 by a pro-Western movement in Ukraine, Russian forces swiftly occupied strategic locations in Crimea. By mid-March, Crimea was formally annexed by Russia following a declaration of independence and a request to join the Russian Federation. Russia\u2019s Strategic Motives for Annexation: Securing Sevastopol The renewed lease in 2010 was opposed by the new Ukrainian leadership. Russia feared losing access to the naval base in Sevastopol if Ukraine consolidated power. NATO Expansion Fears The Kremlin was alarmed by the prospect of Ukraine joining NATO, which would place the alliance on Russia\u2019s Black Sea border, undermining Russian security interests in what was once a \"Soviet lake.\" Crimea as a Launchpad for Invasion Control over Crimea was seen as essential for any future military action in Ukraine. The 2022 invasion was partly enabled by Russia\u2019s fortified presence in the peninsula. Current Status While Ukraine controls the city of Kherson, Russia holds much of the surrounding oblast and thus maintains effective control over the canal\u2019s operations. Donald Trump\u2019s Proposal on Crimea Crimea was part of Russia for centuries before being transferred to Ukraine in 1954 by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. Putin does not accept this transfer and considers it a historical mistake. Trump\u2019s proposal aligns with this and legitimizes Russia\u2019s claim over the peninsula. By freezing Ukraine\u2019s political map as it stands today, the US will secure Crimea \u2014 and the canal \u2014 for Moscow for the long term . Ukraine\u2019s Rejection Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy firmly rejected any deal that involves ceding Ukrainian territory, emphasizing that such an agreement would violate Ukraine\u2019s constitution. Geopolitical Risks and Consequences Commentators argue that accepting Trump\u2019s proposal would be disastrous for Ukraine, as it could embolden Russia to eventually conquer all of Ukraine. Furthermore, such a concession might set a dangerous precedent for other authoritarian regimes, notably China, regarding territorial ambitions, such as over Taiwan.

India\u2019s Urban Future is At a Crossroads April 29, 2025 Context As summer intensifies across India, cities are grappling with severe water shortages, surging electricity demand, and escalating temperatures. Reports from metropolitan areas like Bengaluru and Hyderabad reveal a sharp increase in water tanker bookings and frequent power cuts driven by heightened air-conditioner usage. These annual struggles highlight a pressing question: Are Indian cities prepared to withstand climate extremes and the pressures of rapid urbanisation? The Complexities of Urban Growth and Limitations of Current Indices The Complexities of Urban Growth Urbanisation in India has brought economic opportunities, innovation, and growth. However, it has also exacerbated pollution, congestion, and environmental degradation, disproportionately affecting the underprivileged. According to the Sustainable Futures Collective\u2019s report \u201cIs India Ready for a Warming World?\u201d (2025), Indian cities still have a long way to go in terms of long-term climate planning. Repeated concerns raised in Parliament about the worsening urban heat island effect reinforce the stark realities on the ground. As India aims to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG-11), building inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities by 2030, these issues demand immediate and sustained attention. Limitations of Current Indices While global frameworks for measuring SDG-11 progress exist, India lacks robust, city-level tools for effective tracking. NITI Aayog\u2019s SDG Urban Index evaluates 56 cities across 77 indicators, yet its assessment of SDG-11 is limited to just four parameters: Swachh Survekshan (sanitation survey), road accident deaths, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (housing scheme), and waste treatment coverage. Meanwhile, the Ease of Living Index covers 111 cities but does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of SDG-11 dimensions . International indices such as Mercer\u2019s Quality of Living Index and the Economist Intelligence Unit\u2019s Resilient Cities Index offer valuable insights but often fail to account for India\u2019s unique urban realities. This absence of a focused, context-sensitive SDG-11 index creates a significant policy-research gap, limiting policymakers' ability to identify which cities are truly safe, sustainable, and inclusive. A New Approach to Measuring Urban Progress To bridge this gap, researchers have developed four distinct indices focusing on the core pillars of SDG-11: safety, inclusivity, resilience, and sustainability. Ten major cities, Hyderabad, Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, Mumbai, Pune, Kolkata, Jaipur, Ahmedabad, and Surat, were ranked using indicators drawn from United Nations urban frameworks. Data sources included the Census 2011, Road Transport Yearbook, Indian Forest Survey, National Crime Records Bureau, Periodic Labour Force Survey, National Family Health Survey-5, Reserve Bank of India, India Meteorological Department, and the Ola Mobility Institute\u2019s Ease of Moving Index 2022. Employing the Shannon Entropy Weighting Technique from Multi-Criteria Decision-Making modelling, researchers assigned objective weights to the indicators, enhancing the reliability of the indices. The findings reveal striking disparities: Inclusivity : Ahmedabad ranked highest, while Jaipur performed the worst. Safety : Bengaluru was found to be the safest city; Kolkata ranked the lowest. Sustainability : Surat led, whereas Kolkata lagged. Resilience : Chennai topped the resilience index; Jaipur ranked last. Notably, cities that were deemed front-runners in NITI Aayog\u2019s SDG-11 assessments performed poorly under this new, more rigorous evaluation. Key Insights and Challenges These variations spotlight urgent urban challenges: Inclusivity gaps show deep-rooted disparities in economic and social access, underscoring the need for equitable urban development. Safety rankings highlight inconsistent urban security and law enforcement across cities. Sustainability outcomes point to uneven progress in waste management, environmental planning, and pollution control. Resilience disparities reveal significant deficiencies in disaster preparedness and recovery strategies. The Annual Survey of Indian City Systems 2023 by Janaagraha reinforces these concerns, reporting that only 16 cities have a dedicated \u201ccity sustainability plan\u201d and only 17 have formal city resilience strategies. Such deficits reveal the groundwork still needed for India to achieve meaningful progress toward SDG-11. The Road Ahead City-level Monitoring : Urban Local Bodies (ULBs ) must adopt SDG-11 tracking frameworks , similar to the district-level mechanisms established by some states. Leveraging Technology : Integrated Command and Control Centres (ICCCs) under the Smart Cities Mission should be utilised for real-time urban data collection to enhance planning and decision-making.

In March and April, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) system faced three outages, disrupting payments on apps like GPay and PhonePe. One major cause was individual banks overwhelming the National Payments Corporation of India\u2019s (NPCI) systems by sending excessive transaction status check requests. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? How UPI Works Why NPCI Faced Several Outages Why Banks Are Displeased with UPI How UPI Works UPI is built on the Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) architecture. For UPI transactions, banks must join the UPI system and allow users to link their bank accounts via a mobile number on a Payment Service Provider (PSP) app like PhonePe or GPay. Almost all public and private banks are part of this network. Interoperability UPI is designed to be interoperable, enabling users to access their bank accounts through any UPI-enabled app and even register on multiple apps simultaneously. Role of NPCI While UPI appears to be a peer-to-peer system, nearly all transactions are routed through the NPCI . NPCI encrypts the user's PIN and forwards payment information to the payer\u2019s bank, which then processes the transaction. Single Point of Failure Since NPCI handles critical encryption and transaction routing, any downtime at NPCI results in complete disruption, as banks cannot independently process UPI transactions without it. Why NPCI Faced Several Outages NPCI is a collective of banks, with public sector banks holding the majority stake, as required by the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007. Being bank-led, much of the system's implementation is left to individual banks, though NPCI oversees the UPI design and management. Cause of Outages Recently, individual banks overwhelmed the NPCI systems by sending excessive \u201ccheck transaction\u201d requests to verify completed payments. This stressed the system\u2019s single point of failure and caused brief outages. Introduction of UPI Lite To reduce downtime impact, NPCI introduced UPI Lite, allowing users to make small payments (up to \u20b92,000) without entering a PIN. However, even UPI Lite transactions still pass through NPCI servers for device verification, meaning NPCI remains a critical intermediary. Persistent Single Point of Failure Despite lighter processes like UPI Lite, NPCI continues to be at the center of all UPI activity, maintaining its position as a single point of vulnerability. Why Banks Are Displeased with UPI Lack of Significant Fees Although UPI has revolutionized payments in India, banks have limited opportunities to collect fees from transactions, despite the associated costs. Banks incur around \u20b90.80 per transaction, mainly due to SMS notification charges and the costs of maintaining payment records. However, they cannot charge a Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) for these services. Impact on Bank Incentives Without the ability to charge MDR, banks have few incentives to maintain rigorous uptime standards, leading to more frequent outages compared to the NPCI. These outages result in increased payment declines. Comparison with Card Networks Commercial card networks like MasterCard and Visa experience fewer and shorter downtimes, thanks to better monitoring and enforceable service level agreements (SLAs). Government\u2019s Incentive Programme To address the issue, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has introduced a \u201ccarrot and stick\u201d approach. This includes an annual UPI incentive program that rewards banks based on their performance and penalizes those with poor uptime. The subsidy compensates banks for not being able to charge MDR. Banks with the lowest performance in uptime receive no compensation.

Expanding Tree Cover is Crucial April 30, 2025 Context As climate change intensifies, nations are seeking sustainable solutions to reduce carbon emissions and restore ecological balance. For India, a rapidly developing economy with high carbon dependencies, tree plantation and carbon sequestration have emerged as indispensable tools. These tools are necessary not only to mitigate climate change but also to strengthen environmental resilience , industrial competitiveness, and rural livelihoods. The Urgent Need for Afforestation and Environmental and Economic Benefits The Urgent Need for Afforestation India\u2019s forest and tree cover currently stands at 25.17%, significantly below the 33% target outlined in the National Forest Policy of 1988. This gap is critical , especially as deforestation, urban expansion, and industrial emissions continue to strain ecological systems. Forests serve as natural carbon sinks , absorbing atmospheric CO\u2082 and regulating climate systems. The need to enhance India\u2019s carbon sequestration potential through afforestation is urgent , not just as a climate imperative, but also as a socio-economic strategy. Environmental and Economic Benefits Large-scale tree plantations offer multifaceted benefits . Beyond absorbing greenhouse gases, they contribute to improving soil health, reducing erosion, recharging groundwater, and increasing resilience against climate-induced disasters like droughts and floods. These environmental functions translate into economic value , particularly in rural areas where afforestation creates jobs in nursery management, forest restoration, and agroforestry. Agroforestry, which integrates trees with crops and livestock systems, is especially promising. It enhances biodiversity, boosts productivity , and diversifies income streams. According to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, agroforestry practices can raise farm incomes by 20\u201330%, showcasing their potential for climate adaptation and rural development. Policy Initiatives and Private Sector Involvement Recognising these benefits, India has rolled out several policies to accelerate afforestation. The National Agroforestry Policy (2014) and the Trees Outside Forests in India Program encourage private landowners and industries to undertake tree planting, reducing pressure on natural forests and restoring degraded lands. One flagship initiative, the Green India Mission (GIM), under the National Action Plan on Climate Change, has been instrumental in increasing forest cover and promoting sustainable forest management. Between 2017 and 2021, GIM contributed to a 0.56% increase in forest area , signalling modest but tangible progress. Corporate engagement has also grown , driven by environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals and international pressure. Companies in sectors such as cement, steel, and automotiv e have adopted tree plantation drives as part of their carbon offset strategies. These efforts are not merely philanthropic; they are increasingly strategic, helping firms earn carbon credits under mechanisms like the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS ) and Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Global Pressures and Competitive Advantage India\u2019s industrial sector faces growing international scrutiny regarding carbon intensity. Notably, the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), set to take effect in 2026, will levy tariffs on carbon-intensive imports such as steel, aluminium, and cement. With India-EU trade hitting \u20ac124 billion in 2023, non-compliance could erode India's export competitiveness. Consequently, afforestation presents a cost-effective alternative for emission reduction. While the average price of carbon credits under the EU Emissions Trading System reached \u20ac83 per tonne in 2023 , investing in domestic tree plantations allows Indian firms to offset emissions at a lower cost , while also contributing to national climate goals. Challenges and Policy Recommendations Despite its promise, large-scale afforestation in India faces structural challenges . Chief among them is the lack of a robust carbon trading framework. To fully leverage the global carbon market, India must establish a transparent national carbon credit registry and adopt a clear regulatory framework under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Furthermore, financial incentives and risk mitigation tools are necessary to encourage long-term private sector investments in forestry projects. Additionally, there is a need for greater community involvement. Empowering rural communities through training, financial support, and market linkages can ensure the sustainability and scalability of afforestation efforts. Local participation not only increases the success of these projects but also fosters a sense of ownership and environmental stewardship.

A Powerful Judicial Remedy for Waste Management April 30, 2025 Context India\u2019s plastic pollution crisis has reached alarming levels , as highlighted by a recent study published in Nature, which ranks the country as the largest contributor to global plastic emissions. Releasing an estimated 9.3 million tonnes annually, nearly 20% of global emissions, India\u2019s plastic waste problem is not only a reflection of consumer behaviour and systemic mismanagement but also a critical failure of monitoring, data transparency, and institutional accountability. Therefore, it is important to analyse the key challenges, governance failures, and potential legal and administrative solutions to India\u2019s increasing plastic waste crisis. The Core of the Problem: A Deepening Crisis and Data Blindness At the core of the problem lies a glaring mismatch between reported statistics and ground realities. According to the Nature study, India underestimates its per capita plastic waste generation. While the official figure stands at 0.12 kg per capita per day, the study suggests the actual number is closer to 0.54 kg, a more than fourfold discrepancy. Much of this underestimation is attributed to the exclusion of rural areas , uncollected waste, and informal recycling activities from official statistics. Additionally, India\u2019s waste management infrastructure is overwhelmingly reliant on uncontrolled dumpsites , which outnumber sanitary landfills by a staggering 10:1 ratio. This data deficit is particularly stark in ecologically sensitive zones such as the Indian Himalayan Region, where plastic waste has begun to choke delicate mountain ecosystems. Despite alarming anecdotal evidence, no comprehensive or transparent methodology exists to account for either the quantity or quality of waste generated in these regions. Reports by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), based on data from state pollution control boards and municipal bodies, lack methodological transparency and fail to include crucial rural data . This omission further undermines efforts to design effective waste management strategies. Legal Mandates and the Role of Local Governance The Indian legal framework does mandate local governance structures , urban municipal bodies and rural panchayats , to be the primary nodes for waste management. However, without accurate data and adequate infrastructure, these mandates remain largely unfulfilled. There is an urgent need for robust data systems that not only track the generation and composition of waste but also map the infrastructure meant to handle it , such as Material Recovery Facilities (MRFs), recycling units, sanitary landfills, and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) kiosks. To operationalise EPR effectively, the formation of decentralised kiosks across the country is proposed. These would serve as collection points for producer-importer-brand-owner (PIBO) waste and would be staffed to ensure proper segregation and redirection to appropriate recycling or disposal streams. While challenging, such a plan is feasible if built upon a foundation of reliable data, coordination, and technological leverage, a domain where India already has significant capability. Judicial Activism and the Role of the Supreme Court The Indian judiciary, particularly the Supreme Court, has increasingly recognised its role in enforcing environmental safeguards. In a landmark judgment on January 31, the Court ordered a remediation program to reverse environmental degradation caused by tanneries in Vellore, Tamil Nadu. Notably, the Court adopted the principle of continuing mandamus, which enables it to retain jurisdiction over the matter to ensure ongoing compliance. This verdict not only affirmed environmental protection as a constitutional obligation but also reinforced the polluter pays principle, placing absolute liability on polluters for both ecological restoration and victim compensation. This judicial stance presents a viable template for addressing the broader issue of waste mismanagement in India. Continuing mandamus could be institutionalised as a tool to enforce compliance in cases of systemic environmental degradation, especially where government action is ineffective or delayed. The Way Forward: Towards Accountability and Sustainable Development India's plastic waste crisis is not merely an environmental issue but a matter of public health, ecological sustainability, and constitutional justice. Despite having a robust legal framework, enforcement remains weak due to bureaucratic inertia, data opacity, and institutional fragmentation. Bridging the gap between law and practice requires three key interventions: Comprehensive Data and Transparency Waste generation and processing data must be systematically gathered, made public, and subjected to third-party scrutiny. Geotagging of infrastructure and real-time reporting mechanisms should be prioritized.

SC Upholds Use of Spyware, Says National Security Paramount in Pegasus Case April 30, 2025 Why in News? The Supreme Court, while hearing the Pegasus case, said there is no issue with a country having spyware for national security, but the real concern is its use against individuals, which will be examined. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Spyware SC Emphasizes National Security Over Disclosure Spyware Spyware is a type of malicious software (malware) designed to secretly gather data from a user\u2019s device and transmit it to third parties without consent. It is often used for financial gain by advertisers, data brokers, or cybercriminals. Purpose and Risks Spyware collects sensitive information like browsing history, financial details, and login credentials. It poses serious threats by: Enabling identity theft and financial fraud Slowing device and network performance Causing data breaches in businesses Installing additional malicious software Common Types of Spyware Adware \u2013 Monitors activity to serve or sell targeted ads. Infostealer \u2013 Gathers specific data and chat logs. Keyloggers \u2013 Records every keystroke to steal usernames, passwords, and messages. Rootkits \u2013 Grants deep access to a system, often undetectable. Red Shell \u2013 Tracks user activity during PC game installations. System Monitors \u2013 Captures emails, websites visited, and keystrokes. Tracking Cookies \u2013 Follows user behavior across the web. Trojan Horse Virus \u2013 Delivers spyware by disguising as legitimate software. How Spyware Works: The 3-Step Process Infiltration \u2013 Installed via apps, malicious websites, or attachments. Monitoring and Data Capture \u2013 Tracks browsing, captures keystrokes, and takes screenshots. Transmission or Sale \u2013 Sends stolen data to attackers or sells it on the dark web. Impact Spyware compromises personal and business data, facilitates identity theft, and weakens cybersecurity defenses. Detecting and removing spyware can be challenging due to its stealthy nature. SC Emphasizes National Security Over Disclosure The Supreme Court stated that national security cannot be compromised, and there is nothing wrong with a country possessing or using spyware for security purposes . The bench, led by Justice Surya Kant and Justice N Kotiswar Singh, clarified that the key concern is not ownership of spyware but against whom it is deployed. Individual Right to Privacy Recognised While declining to make the full report public, the Court acknowledged that individuals have a Constitutionally protected right to privacy . It stated that people who suspect their phones were hacked deserve to know the truth, and the court would consider informing them individually. Petitions Alleging Government Surveillance The case stems from petitions filed in 2021 by journalists, activists, and public figures. They alleged that the government used Pegasus spyware , a military-grade surveillance tool made by Israel\u2019s NSO Group, to monitor citizens. Petitioners argued that the core issue remains whether the government possesses and has used Pegasus. They stressed that ownership implies the potential for continued surveillance. Justice R V Raveendran Committee Report: No Public Disclosure On demands to release the report of the SC-appointed Justice R V Raveendran committee, the bench refused, citing national security and sovereignty concerns. In October 2021 , the Supreme Court appointed a technical committee to investigate whether individuals' phones were hacked using Pegasus spyware. The committee was supervised by Justice (retd) R.V. Raveendran, and in 2022 , it submitted its findings to the court in a sealed cover. In August 2022, the Supreme Court noted the committee had found no conclusive evidence of Pegasus spyware use in the phones examined. Malware was detected in five devices, but its nature could not be definitively linked to Pegasus. The Centre did not cooperate with the investigation, as per the report. SC remarked that while individuals can be informed if their phones were targeted, the report cannot become a public debate document.

Pakistan's closure of its airspace to Indian airlines is set to impact over 800 weekly flights, leading to longer travel times, higher fuel consumption, and complications in crew and flight scheduling. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Impact of Pakistan Airspace Closure on Indian Flights Pakistan\u2019s Last Airspace Closure Possible Future Outcomes Impact of Pakistan Airspace Closure on Indian Flights Scope of the Ban: Pakistan has banned all aircraft registered in India or operated by Indian carriers from using its airspace. Affected Routes The closure impacts all west-bound flights from northern Indian cities, especially Delhi, to Central Asia, the Caucasus, West Asia, Europe, the UK, and North America. Longer Flight Paths Flights will need to reroute over the Arabian Sea, increasing journey times and leading to higher fuel consumption. Operational Challenges Airlines will face difficulties with fuel management and payload, potentially needing to reduce the number of passengers or baggage to maintain safe weight limits. Increased Costs and Airfares Operational costs will rise due to longer routes and higher fuel burn. Airfares on international routes operated by Indian carriers may increase by 8\u201312%, with a possibility of further hikes if the situation persists. Competitive Disadvantage Foreign airlines that can still use Pakistani airspace will gain a cost advantage over Indian carriers on shared routes. Most Affected Airline Air India, which operates several direct flights to Europe, the US, and Canada from Delhi, is expected to be hit the hardest. Uncertainty in Flight Plans Airlines are still evaluating routing options, and more clarity will come once final flight plans are submitted. IndiGo\u2019s Growing Exposure Since 2019, IndiGo has expanded significantly into Central Asia, Turkey, and the Caucasus, becoming the only Indian carrier operating in those regions. Its operations are notably impacted under the new restrictions. Pakistan\u2019s Last Airspace Closure Pakistan last closed its airspace in February 2019 after the Indian Air Force conducted air strikes in Balakot in response to the Pulwama terror attack. Duration and Impact The closure lasted for several months, causing significant operational disruptions for Indian airlines due to the need for longer alternate routes. Financial Losses Indian airlines collectively incurred losses of around Rs 700 crore, mainly due to increased fuel expenses and logistical challenges. Most Affected Airline Air India suffered the most, as it operated the highest number of west-bound international flights during the closure period.

Background - Petition and Argument Uncontested Elections in Lok Sabha Response of the Election Commission of India (ECI) View of the Supreme Court Background - Petition and Argument The petition was filed in August 2024. It argues that if an election is not held when there is only one candidate, voters lose the chance to choose the \"None of the Above\" (NOTA) option . This, the petition says, violates the fundamental rights of voters. Reference to Supreme Court Judgment The petition cites the Supreme Court\u2019s 2013 judgment in People\u2019s Union for Civil Liberties vs Union of India. In this judgment, the Court recognized the right to cast a negative vote (NOTA) as protected under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. Core Argument It argues that the right to express disapproval through NOTA should be available regardless of the number of candidates contesting the election. Uncontested Elections in Lok Sabha The petition states that between 1951 and 2024, candidates were elected uncontested in 26 Lok Sabha constituencies, based on Election Commission of India reports. As a result, over 82 lakh voters were deprived of their right to vote. Breakup of Uncontested Elections According to the petition, uncontested elections occurred as follows: seven in 1957, five each in 1951 and 1967, three in 1962, two in 1977, and one each in 1971, 1980, 1989, and 2024. Recent Example In 2024, BJP candidate was declared elected unopposed from Surat after all other candidates withdrew or had their nominations rejected. Uncontested Elections in State Assemblies The petition also points out that uncontested elections are more frequent in state Assembly elections. Response of the Election Commission of India (ECI) The ECI, in its counter affidavit, noted that uncontested elections occurred in only nine out of 20 Lok Sabha elections held between 1951 and 2024. Since 1989, only one MP has been elected uncontested, highlighting that such instances have become extremely rare with the growth of political participation and voter awareness . Argument Against the Petition The Commission argued that with democracy evolving and more parties contesting, the likelihood of uncontested elections is now minimal. Therefore, the Supreme Court should not entertain the petition. Position on NOTA The ECI emphasized that the \"None of the Above\" (NOTA) option is available only when polling takes place. NOTA is not to be treated as a competing candidate in uncontested elections. Need for Legislative Change The Commission stated that recognizing NOTA as a mandatory contesting option would require amendments to the RPA, 1951, and the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961, as the current law does not provide for this. View of the Supreme Court Suggestion for Minimum Vote Requirement SC suggested that when only one candidate remains, they should be required to secure a minimum percentage of votes \u2014 such as 10% or 15% \u2014 to be declared elected, rather than winning automatically. Democracy and Majority Principle It emphasized that democracy is founded on majority support, and even in uncontested situations, a candidate should have at least some voters\u2019 approval to uphold democratic principles. Advice to the Government SC urged the government to consider introducing a provision to address such scenarios in the future, stressing that Parliament could decide the specifics. It questioned the idea of allowing someone to enter Parliament \"by default\" without even minimal voter support .

The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has notified the National Mission for Clean Ganga ( NMCG ) as an authority under the Income Tax (IT) Act, 1961 . This grants NMCG income tax exemptions , aiding its functioning under the Namami Gange Programme. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Namami Gange Programme Recent Developments Background and Legal Transition of NMCG Income Tax Issues Related to NMCG Namami Gange Programme: It is an integrated conservation mission , approved as \u2018Flagship Programme\u2019 by the Union Government in 2014 with budget outlay of Rs.20,000 Crores. It is administered by the Ministry of Jal Shakti 's Department of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, to accomplish the twin objectives of - Effective abatement of pollution, Conservation and rejuvenation of National River Ganga. The program would be implemented by the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), and its state counterpart organisations i.e., State Program Management Groups (SPMGs). NMCG is the implementation wing of National Ganga Council (NGC), which replaced the National Ganga River Basin Authority. NGC was created in 2016 under the River Ganga (Rejuvenation, Protection and Management) Authorities Order, 2016. NGC oversees efforts to clean and rejuvenate the Ganga River, and is headed by the PM. In order to implement the programme, a three-tier mechanism has been proposed for project monitoring comprising of: A high-level task force chaired by Cabinet Secretary assisted by NMCG at the national level, State level committee chaired by Chief Secretary assisted by SPMG at the state level, and District level committee chaired by the District Magistrate. Its implementation has been divided into - Entry-Level Activities (for immediate visible impact), Medium-Term Activities (to be implemented within 5 years of time frame) and Long-Term Activities (to be implemented within 10 years). Recent Developments: Legal basis of the CBDT notification: Clause 46A of Section 10, IT Act, 1961: Exemption for income of bodies constituted under a Central/State Act for specified purposes. NMCG was constituted under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. Effective from: Assessment Year (AY) 2024-25. Condition: NMCG must continue as an authority under the Environment (Protection) Act with relevant purposes. Significance: It ensures financial autonomy and operational efficiency for NMCG, crucial for the effective execution of the Namami Gange Programme. Background and Legal Transition of NMCG: Initial status: Registered as a society (August 12, 2011) under the Societies Registration Act, 1860. Upgradation: Declared an \u2018 authority \u2019 (October 7, 2016) under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. Technical issue: Despite this transition, PAN status continued as Association of Persons (AOP), attracting scrutiny and tax demands. Income Tax Issues Related to NMCG: Tax demands: NMCG faced income tax demands totaling \u20b9243.74 crore. Condonation by CBDT: Allowed delayed filing of revised returns for the three assessment years. Enables NMCG to claim tax exemptions retrospectively.

Legal Difference Between Preparing for Rape and Attempting the Crime March 28, 2025 Why in news? The Supreme Court stayed an Allahabad High Court ruling that downgraded charges against three accused from attempted rape to mere preparation, calling the judgment insensitive. The High Court had removed attempted rape charges and directed trial under lesser offences, including IPC Section 354B (using criminal force against a woman) and Sections 9/10 (aggravated sexual assault) of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO Act). The case highlights the critical legal distinction between \u201cpreparation\u201d (generally not punishable) and \u201cattempt\u201d (criminally punishable), prompting Supreme Court intervention. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s article? Background of the case Distinction Between \u2018Preparation\u2019 and \u2018Attempt\u2019 Allahabad HC Downgrades Attempted Rape Charges Historical Precedents in Attempted Rape Cases Background of the case The High Court was hearing an appeal against a POCSO court order that had summoned the accused for trial under Section 376 IPC (rape) and Section 18 of the POCSO Act (punishment for attempt). On March 17, the HC removed attempted rape charges, terming the act as mere \"preparation.\" Key Legal Distinction: Preparation vs. Attempt The case highlights the crucial difference between \"preparation\" (generally not punishable) and \"attempt\" (which is criminally punishable), leading to Supreme Court intervention. Distinction Between \u2018Preparation\u2019 and \u2018Attempt\u2019 The Supreme Court has clarified that an attempt to commit an offence goes beyond preparation and involves concrete steps toward committing the crime. Preparation is merely a stage that precedes an attempt. Legal Criteria for \u2018Attempt\u2019 In Abhayanand Mishra v. State of Bihar (1961), the SC outlined key requirements to establish an attempt: The accused had the intention to commit the offence. The accused prepared to commit the offence. The accused took actions towards committing the offence (not necessarily the final act). The penultimate act occurred during the course of committing the offence ( proximity requirement ). Key SC Ruling: Where Attempt Begins In State of Maharashtra v. Mohd. Yakub (1980), the SC ruled that \u201cattempt begins where preparation ends\u201d \u2014an accused cannot be punished for mere preparation without an overt act leading to the crime. Allahabad HC Downgrades Attempted Rape Charges The Allahabad High Court ruled that the accused could not be charged with attempted rape, stating that the prosecution failed to prove the offence had progressed beyond preparation. HC\u2019s Reasoning The court held that the allegations did not meet the legal threshold for attempted rape , as no concrete steps towards the offence were proven. It relied on the 1836 English case Rex v. James Lloyd, which required evidence that the accused intended to gratify their passions despite resistance . The HC noted no claim of penetrative assault , a key requirement for proving rape under the IPC . Reduced Charges and Punishment The HC ruled that the accused could only be charged under Section 354B IPC (assault with intent to disrobe a woman) , which carries a punishment of 1-5 years in prison , rather than attempted rape under the IPC and POCSO Act. Historical Precedents in Attempted Rape Cases The Lloyd ruling (1836) , despite being nearly two centuries old, continues to influence Indian courts in determining whether an accused has attempted to commit rape. Recent Applications of the Lloyd Ruling May 2024 : The Rajasthan High Court applied the Lloyd test and altered an attempted rape conviction, reducing the charge to Section 354 IPC (assault on a woman with intent to outrage modesty). 2004: In Aman Kumar & Anr v. State of Haryana , the Supreme Court adopted a similar approach, lowering the conviction from attempted rape to a lesser offence. SC\u2019s Criticism and Potential Legal Reassessment On March 25, 2025, the Supreme Court took suo motu cognizance of the Allahabad HC\u2019s ruling and issued a stay, strongly criticizing its reasoning. The SC remarked that the observations were legally flawed, insensitive, and inhumane. This case presents an opportunity for the Supreme Court to reconsider and redefine the legal standard for attempted rape.

Judicial Appointments in India - Evolution, Challenges, and the NJAC Verdict March 27, 2025 Context: The controversy surrounding the discovery of massive cash at Delhi HC judge Justice Yashwant Varma's home last week has reignited interest in the debate of judicial appointments in India. \u201cThings would have been different\u201d if the Supreme Court had not struck down the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act passed by Parliament in 2014.\" ( Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar ) Judicial Appointments in India: Article 124 of the Constitution establishes and governs the Supreme Court of India. Article 124 (2): The President, on the advice of the Council of Ministers, appoints Supreme Court judges in consultation with the Chief Justice of India (CJI). B.R. Ambedkar opposed granting veto power to the CJI, rejecting the substitution of \u201cconsultation\u201d with \u201cconcurrence.\u201d Evolution of Judicial Appointments: Early years (1950-1970s): Initially, the executive had full discretion in appointing judges. Judicial independence was not a major issue despite constitutional amendments. The 1970s saw executive interference, including the supersession of judges , leading to concerns over judicial autonomy. For example, Justice M H Beg was appointed CJI in 1977, overlooking Justice H R Khanna, who was first in seniority. First Judges case (1981) - S P Gupta case: The Supreme Court ruled that \u201cconsultation\u201d (in Article 124) does not mean \u201cconcurrence.\u201d The executive retained discretion in judicial appointments. Second and Third Judges cases (1993 and 1998): The Court reversed its earlier stance , ruling that \u201cconsultation\u201d meant \u201cconcurrence.\u201d The collegium system was established, transferring power from the executive to a body of judges. The Collegium System: Established through judicial rulings, not mentioned in the Constitution . Headed by the CJI , it includes the four senior-most Supreme Court judges. It makes recommendations for the appointment of judges to the SC, the appointment of Chief Justices of the High Courts, and the transfer of judges of High Courts. A three-member collegium, headed by the CJI and comprising the two senior-most judges of that court, makes recommendations for the appointment of judges to the High Courts. The collegium system is often criticized for lack of transparency, accountability, and lobbying within the system. The National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC): The Parliament passed the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, 2014 , and the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act, 2014. These two laws provided for an independent commission to appoint judges to the SC and High Courts, replacing the collegium system. The NJAC comprised six members: Chief Justice of India (Chairperson) Two senior-most Supreme Court judges Union Minister of Law and Justice Two eminent persons from civil society (one from SC/ST/OBC/minorities or women) to be nominated by a committee comprising the CJI, the PM, and the LoP in Lok Sabha. It enjoyed near-unanimous political support and was ratified by 16 state legislatures. Striking Down of NJAC (2015): The Supreme Court declared NJAC unconstitutional in a 4:1 judgment. Key issue: Veto power of non-judicial members, allowing any two NJAC members to reject a recommendation and risking the judiciary being outnumbered by the executive. The Court invoked the Basic Structure Doctrine, ruling that judicial primacy in appointments is essential for judicial independence . Justice Jasti Chelameswar\u2019s dissenting opinion: Criticized the collegium system\u2019s secrecy, lack of transparency, and lobbying. Argued that NJAC was a better alternative if properly structured. Justice Kurian Joseph (concurring judgment): Acknowledged lack of transparency, accountability, and credibility in the collegium system. Later regretted striking down NJAC , citing collegium failures. Can NJAC be Revived? The NJAC was struck down before being tested in practice , leaving room for revisiting judicial reforms. Alternative proposals suggest modifications: Giving the CJI a casting vote to ensure judicial predominance. Eliminating the veto power of non-judicial members. Ensuring appointments are not subject to executive reconsideration. Conclusion and the Way Forward: The NJAC case was a missed opportunity for judicial reforms. Growing concerns over collegium opacity and internal politics warrant a fresh debate on judicial appointments. A balanced system ensuring both judicial independence and accountability remains a key issue in India\u2019s constitutional framework.

A new study, \u2018 Long-term impact and biological recovery in a deep-sea mining track\u2019 , published in Nature, reveals that a section of the Pacific Ocean seabed mined over 40 years ago has not yet recovered. Conducted by scientists led by Britain\u2019s National Oceanography Centre, the study found long-term sediment changes and a decline in larger marine organisms. The findings come amid increasing calls for a moratorium on deep-sea mining. Recently, 36 countries attended a UN International Seabed Authority meeting in Jamaica to discuss whether mining companies should be permitted to extract metals from the ocean floor. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Deep Sea Mining Key Findings of the Study Deep-Sea Mining and Its Future Deep Sea Mining Deep sea mining involves extracting mineral deposits and metals from the ocean\u2019s seabed. It is classified into three types: Collecting polymetallic nodules from the ocean floor Mining massive seafloor sulphide deposits Stripping cobalt crusts from underwater rocks Significance of Deep Sea Mining These deposits contain valuable materials like nickel, rare earth elements, and cobalt, which are essential for renewable energy technologies, batteries, and everyday electronics such as cellphones and computers. Technological Developments in Deep Sea Mining The engineering methods for deep sea mining are still evolving. Companies are exploring: Vacuum-based extraction using massive pumps AI-driven deep-sea robots to selectively pick up nodules Advanced underwater machines to mine materials from underwater mountains and volcanoes Strategic Importance Governments and companies see deep sea mining as crucial due to depleting onshore reserves and rising global demand for these critical materials. Key Findings of the Study The study examined the long-term impact of a small-scale mining experiment conducted in 1979 on a section of the Pacific Ocean seafloor. The experiment involved removing polymetallic nodules, and scientists analyzed the affected 8-meter strip during an expedition in 2023. Key Findings Long-Term Environmental Impact : The mining led to lasting changes in the sediment and a decline in marine organism populations. Partial Recovery Observed : While some areas showed little to no recovery, certain animal groups were beginning to recolonize and repopulate. Broader Concerns About Deep Sea Mining Previous studies have warned about negative effects of deep sea mining below 200 meters, including: Harmful noise and vibrations Sediment plumes and light pollution A 2023 study in Current Biology found that deep sea mining significantly reduces animal populations and has a wider ecological impact than previously estimated. Significance for Policy and Environmental Debate The study provides crucial data for assessing the long-term effects of deep-sea mining and guiding future regulations by the International Seabed Authority (ISA) . Findings suggest that while some marine life begins to recover, full ecosystem restoration remains uncertain and may take decades . The research forms part of the Seabed Mining and Resilience to Experimental Impact (SMARTEX) project, which aims to support informed decision-making on deep-sea mining's societal and ecological implications. Deep-Sea Mining and Its Future The Clarion Clipperton Zone (CCZ) is a vast, mineral-rich region in the Pacific Ocean, home to unique deep-sea biodiversity and crucial metal resources. CCZ is a vast plain in the North Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and Mexico. It is known to hold large volumes of polymetallic nodules containing minerals used in electric vehicles and solar panels including manganese, nickel, copper, and cobalt. Governments and companies are increasingly considering deep-sea mining to meet global demand for critical minerals needed in renewable energy and technology. The ISA is currently evaluating whether and under what conditions deep-sea mining should be permitted.

Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024: Major Changes and Parliamentary Debate March 27, 2025 Why in the News? Both the Houses of the Parliament have passed the Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024, which allows bank account holders to have up to four nominees. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? About Banking Laws Bill (Objective, Key Features, etc.) News Summary (Gov\u2019s Arguments, Oppositions\u2019 Concerns, etc.) Understanding the Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024: The Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024 was introduced in the Lok Sabha on August 9, 2024 , and passed on December 3, 2024 . The Bill amends five major laws governing India\u2019s banking sector: Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 Banking Regulation Act, 1949 State Bank of India Act, 1955 Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Acts of 1970 and 1980 Key Features of the Bill: Four nominees for deposits : Deposit holders can now appoint up to four nominees, either successively or simultaneously. Previously, only one nominee was allowed. Updated definition of \u2018fortnight\u2019 : For calculating cash reserves, banks will now follow fixed calendar periods\u20141st to 15th or 16th to month-end\u2014instead of the old Saturday-to-Friday format. Extended director tenure in co-operative banks : Directors can now serve for 10 consecutive years , up from the earlier limit of 8 years. Dual directorship allowed in certain co-operative banks : A director of a central co-operative bank can now serve on the board of a state co-operative bank if they are a member. Increased threshold for \u2018substantial interest\u2019 : The definition now includes shareholdings worth up to \u20b92 crore, replacing the outdated \u20b95 lakh cap set decades ago. Unclaimed funds broadened : Unclaimed dividends, shares, and bond payments older than seven years will be transferred to the Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF) . Bank autonomy in auditor pay : Banks will now decide the remuneration of their auditors instead of the RBI and Central Government doing so. News Summary: The Rajya Sabha passed the Bill on March 26, 2025 , amid both support and criticism. Over 20 MPs took part in a four-hour discussion, which highlighted different aspects of the banking system\u2019s health and governance. Government\u2019s Stand: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman defended the Bill, saying it brings necessary reforms. She made the following key points: Public sector banks posted a record \u20b91.41 lakh crore profit in FY 2023\u201324 . Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) have significantly reduced. Over 912 bank fraud cases involving wilful defaulters are under probe by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). Loan write-offs are accounting practices, not waivers\u2014banks still pursue recovery. Opposition\u2019s Concerns: Wilful Defaulters & Write-offs They highlighted that \u20b987,000 crore owed by 50 wilful defaulters\u2014including names like Mehul Choksi and Rishi Agarwal \u2014were written off, while poor and small borrowers face harsh actions. Need for Deeper Scrutiny Opposition members criticised the practice of amending five laws at once without detailed review, calling for a Joint Parliamentary Committee to examine the Bill. Concerns About NPAs Opposition said Indian banks are burdened with \u20b910 lakh crore in NPAs over five years, largely due to a small group of high-profile defaulters. Issues in Rural and Cooperative Banks Opposition raised concerns about the rising financial frauds in cooperative banks (over 4,000 cases in five years ) and outdated tech infrastructure. They also questioned the static \u20b92 crore cap and suggested linking it to inflation. Government\u2019s Counterpoints The government said the Bill gives new strength to the banking sector and pointed to improvements under the government post-2014, including widespread financial inclusion and direct benefit transfers. Conclusion: The Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024 represents a major update in India's banking regulation , addressing everything from customer convenience to board governance. While the provisions are largely forward-looking, concerns about oversight, transparency, and the handling of large-scale NPAs remain. newspaper.pdf ( Size: 711.4 KB ) Latest Article See All IndiGo Meltdown Dec. 5, 2025, 2:34 p.m. Economics India to Expand Its Busiest Rail Corridors: What\u2019s Planned Dec. 5, 2025, 2:08 p.m. Economics Census 2027 - Counting India, Renewing the Republic Dec. 5, 2025, 1:54 p.m. Editorial Analysis Health and National Security Cess on Demerit Goods Dec. 5, 2025, 1:48 p.m. Economics A Missing Link in India\u2019s Mineral Mission Dec. 5, 2025, 1:33 p.m. Editorial Analysis A Day to Pause and Come Down to Earth Dec. 5, 2025, 1:27 p.m. Editorial Analysis Rupee Breaches the 90-Mark Dec. 4, 2025, 1:36 p.m. Economics Putin\u2019s Visit: India\u2013Russia Ties and the Road Ahead Dec. 4, 2025, 1:24 p.m. International Relations Judiciary Flags Major Lapses in Critical Care for Acid Attack Survivors Dec. 4, 2025, 1:13 p.m. Polity & Governance India\u2019s Seven-Point Energy", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}
{"id": "9598d86d-bd3d-4db8-aa8f-845574f70999", "text": "Home / Mains Articles / India's Cotton Crisis ... India's Cotton Crisis - From Self-Sufficiency to Import Dependence March 29, 2025 Context: India, once a leading producer and exporter of cotton, is now facing a severe decline in production and has become a net importer of the natural fibre . The crisis is largely due to policy paralysis and restrictions on genetically modified (GM) crops rather than external factors. The Rise of India's Cotton Production: Technological advancements: India became a major cotton producer due to hybrid technology and later, genetically modified (GM) Bt cotton . GM cotton revolution: 1970: H-4, the world\u2019s first cotton hybrid, developed by C.T. Patel. 1972: Varalaxmi, the first interspecific cotton hybrid, developed by B.H. Katarki. 2002-03: Introduction of GM Bt cotton , which offered resistance against the American bollworm. 2006: Bollgard-II technology introduced, providing additional protection against pests. 2013-14: 95% of India's cotton cultivation adopted Bt cotton, pushing yield to a peak of 566 kg per hectare . The Decline in Cotton Production: Production trends: 2002-03 to 2013-14: Production surged from 13.6 million bales (mb, 1 bale=170 kg) to 39.8 mb. The imports halved to 1.1 mb and exports surged well over hundredfold to 11.6 mb (from not even 0.1 mb in 2002-03). 2024-25: Projected at 29.5 mb, the lowest since 2008-09 . Imports surpassing exports: 3 mb imports vs. 1.7 mb exports. Reasons for decline: Policy restrictions on GM technology and regulatory hurdles. For example , the treatment of GM crops as \u201chazardous substances\u201d under the Environment Protection Act, 1986. Resistance to scientific advancements in agriculture. Pink bollworm infestation due to lack of new pest-resistant varieties. Regulatory and Policy Failures: Ban on GM crops: 2010: Moratorium on GM Bt brinjal , setting a precedent for halting GM crop approvals. Field trials of new GM cotton hybrids blocked under the NDA government. Regulatory deadlock despite scientific validation and biosafety data. Judicial and activist interventions: Activist-driven opposition led to stagnation in agricultural biotech research. Courts stepping into technical domains have further slowed progress. Economic Implications: Impact on trade: A country that was the world\u2019s no . 1 producer in 2015-16 and a close second biggest exporter to the US by 2011-12 has today been \u201cinundated\u201d by American, Australian, Egyptian and Brazilian cotton. Cotton imports doubled in value in 2024-25 compared to the previous year (from $518.4 million to $1,040.4 million) alongside a dip in exports (from $729.4 million to $660.5 million). Pressure from the US and Brazil to remove the 11% import duty on cotton. Impact on farmers: Indian farmers are denied access to the latest GM technologies . Despite resistance to GM crops, GM soyameal and corn are being imported . Need for Policy Reforms: Scientific approach over activism: Policy decisions should be based on scientific validation rather than public consultations dominated by activists. Revival of GM research: Approval of new pest-resistant GM cotton varieties. Establishment of a transparent and evidence-based regulatory framework . Reducing import dependence: Encouraging domestic production through technology adoption. Balancing environmental concerns with the need for agricultural progress . Conclusion: In 1853, Karl Marx famously wrote how British rule \u201cbroke up the Indian handloom and destroyed the spinning wheel\u201d, and finally \u201cinundated the very mother country of cotton with cottons\u201d. Something similar has taken place with Indian cotton over the last decade. However, it was not by any grand imperialist design, but by sheer domestic policy paralysis and ineptitude. India\u2019s cotton crisis underscores the urgent need for a balanced, science-driven approach to agricultural policy. The failure to act decisively has not only hurt farmers but also made India reliant on foreign cotton, benefiting global competitors like the US and Brazil.

{"id": "9beaa745-9b1c-4e46-8575-7ec4fa4ab7d5", "text": "Home / Mains Articles / The Issue is About the... The Issue is About the \u2018Quality\u2019 of India\u2019s Publications March 27, 2025 Context Scientific progress is a cornerstone of national development , and nations that prioritise research and innovation tend to lead the global economy. At a recent National Science Day function, India\u2019s Union Minister for Science and Technology made an ambitious claim: India will overtake the United States in the number of scientific publications by 2029. However, a deeper examination of international research metrics , funding allocation, and research quality suggests that this assertion is more aspirational than realistic. Comparing Research Output and Investments A crucial factor in scientific progress is the level of investment in research and development (R&D). The data for six leading research nations illustrate a stark contrast: Israel spends 6.3% of its GDP on R&D, South Korea 4.9%, Japan 3.3%, the United States 3.46%, Germany 3.13%, China 2.4%, and India a mere 0.67%. These figures highlight a fundamental problem , India cannot expect to compete with scientific powerhouses while investing significantly less in R&D. China\u2019s research dominance is backed by long-term strategic investments in education and scientific infrastructure. Since 2006, China has implemented a well-planned Medium-to-Long-Term Plan (MLP) for science and technology development , leading to a research output of 898,949 publications. In contrast, the U.S. produced 457,335 publications, while India lagged with 207,390 papers. Given these figures, India's claim that it will surpass the U.S. in research output by 2029 appears unfounded. The Issue of Research Quality A more relevant measure of impact is the quality of research, which can be evaluated using citation impact, the Hirsch Index (H-Index), and the Impact Factor (IF) of journals in which papers are published. According to Clarivate, a global research analytics firm, India\u2019s citation impact (CNCI) stands at 0.879, compared to 1.12 for China and 1.25 for the U.S. Among 30 ranked countries, India is positioned at a disappointing 28th place. A case study in chemistry research provides further insight. An analysis of publications in top-tier chemistry journals between 2017 and 2024 revealed that the U.S., China, and India contribute vastly different numbers of papers. For instance , in the prestigious Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS), the U.S. published 8,503 papers, China 5,521, and India only 305. Moreover, a breakdown of Chinese institutions shows that even second-tier Chinese universities produce significantly more research than India\u2019s premier institutions, such as the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). This disparity underscores India's weak research ecosystem and the need for deeper systemic changes. The Challenge of Ethics and Research Integrity in Indian Science The Proliferation of Predatory Journals These journals often have misleading impact factors , fake editorial boards, and little to no editorial oversight. A 2018 study found that 62% of the world's standalone predatory journals originate in India. This means that a significant portion of Indian research is published in outlets that do not ensure academic rigor , thereby diminishing its global credibility. The most infamous case is the Hyderabad-based Omics Group , which was fined $50 million by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2019 for deceptive publishing practices. The Omics Group published thousands of articles in questionable journals, falsely claiming that they were peer-reviewed and had high impact factors. It also tricked researchers into paying hefty publication fees , exploiting the pressure on Indian academics to publish in large numbers for career advancement. With 69,000 articles published through this unethical model, Omics significantly polluted global scientific literature, making it difficult to distinguish legitimate research from junk science. Plagiarism and Fabrication of Data Plagiarism and data fabrication are other pressing concerns in Indian academia. Many research papers have been found to be either copied from existing work or based on manipulated data. This unethical behaviour is often driven by institutional pressures to meet publication quotas for promotions and funding. Several high-profile cases have exposed these issues. In 2020, a senior professor at Banaras Hindu University (BHU) was accused of plagiarising multiple research papers. Similarly, the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) saw a scandal where fabricated data was used in published research. Retractions of Indian research papers due to plagiarism and falsification have been steadily increasing, leading to embarrassment for the country\u2019s scientific community. The Weakness of the Peer Review System A robust peer review system is essential for maintaining scientific quality, but in India, this system is often compromised.

India's E-Retail Market Surpasses US at $60 Billion, but Growth Slows in 2024 March 28, 2025 Why in News? India's e-commerce market has reached $60 billion in gross merchandise value (GMV), becoming the world's second-largest online shopper base. GMV is the total value of merchandise that's sold over a given period through a customer-to-customer (C2C) exchange site. However, growth slowed to 10-12% in 2024, down from the historical 20%, due to higher inflation and stagnant real wages, according to a Flipkart-Bain report. Despite short-term challenges, long-term prospects remain strong, driven by three key trends: quick commerce , trend-first commerce (especially in fashion), and hyper-value commerce. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Government Initiatives Boosting E-commerce in India E-Retail Slowdown Key Drivers of E-Retail Growth Government Initiatives Boosting E-commerce in India Digital Infrastructure & Policy Support The Indian government has launched key initiatives like Digital India, Make in India, Start-up India, and Skill India, driving e-commerce growth. The Government e-Marketplace (GeM) has surpassed \u20b94 lakh crore GMV in FY24, enhancing procurement efficiency. Expanding E-commerce Access Collaborations like CSC-ONDC (Open Network for Digital Commerce) aim to extend e-commerce to rural areas. The National Retail Policy focuses on digitization and ease of business, while FDI in B2B e-commerce is now allowed up to 100%. Regulatory & Tax Measures Consumer Protection (E-commerce) Rules 2020 ensure fair competition. 5G expansion is expected to further accelerate digital commerce adoption. E-Retail Slowdown India\u2019s private consumption growth has slowed from 11% (2017\u201319) to 8% (2022\u201324), driven by high inflation and stagnant real wages. This has impacted e-retail, with growth dropping to 10\u201312% in 2024, compared to historical rates of over 20%. Expected Rebound and Future Growth Fiscal and monetary policy interventions are anticipated to revive e-retail growth, particularly from the 2025 festive season. By 2030, the market is expected to reach $170\u2013190 billion, growing at over 18% annually. As India's GDP per capita crosses $3,500\u20134,000, discretionary spending is set to rise, with nearly 1 in 10 retail dollars projected to be spent online. Key Drivers of E-Retail Growth High-frequency categories like grocery, lifestyle, and general merchandise will fuel e-retail expansion, making up two-thirds of total online spending by 2030. E-retail penetration in these segments is expected to grow 2\u20134 times over this period. Rise of Tier-3 and Smaller Cities Online shopping adoption is shifting from Tier-2 to Tier-3 cities, with 60% of new shoppers since 2020 coming from smaller cities. The Northeast has 1.2 times higher e-retail penetration than the rest of India. Additionally, 60% of new sellers since 2021 are from Tier-2 or smaller cities, diversifying the seller base. Quick Commerce\u2019s Rapid Expansion Quick commerce dominates e-grocery, accounting for two-thirds of orders and 10% of total e-retail spending. It is projected to grow over 40% annually until 2030, expanding across new categories and geographies. Trend-First and Hyper-Value Commerce on the Rise Trend-first fashion is set to grow fourfold, reaching $8\u201310 billion by 2028, with over half of sales happening online. Hyper-value commerce, driven by ultra-low-price assortments, has grown from 5% of e-retail GMV in 2021 to over 12% in 2024, gaining traction among lower-middle-income consumers in smaller cities. Hyper-value commerce refers to a retail model that focuses on offering ultra-low-priced products to attract cost-conscious consumers. newspaper.pdf ( Size: 515.7 KB ) Latest Article See All IndiGo Meltdown Dec. 5, 2025, 2:34 p.m. Economics India to Expand Its Busiest Rail Corridors: What\u2019s Planned Dec. 5, 2025, 2:08 p.m. Economics Census 2027 - Counting India, Renewing the Republic Dec. 5, 2025, 1:54 p.m. Editorial Analysis Health and National Security Cess on Demerit Goods Dec. 5, 2025, 1:48 p.m. Economics A Missing Link in India\u2019s Mineral Mission Dec. 5, 2025, 1:33 p.m. Editorial Analysis A Day to Pause and Come Down to Earth Dec. 5, 2025, 1:27 p.m. Editorial Analysis Rupee Breaches the 90-Mark Dec. 4, 2025, 1:36 p.m. Economics Putin\u2019s Visit: India\u2013Russia Ties and the Road Ahead Dec. 4, 2025, 1:24 p.m. International Relations Judiciary Flags Major Lapses in Critical Care for Acid Attack Survivors Dec. 4, 2025, 1:13 p.m. Polity & Governance India\u2019s Seven-Point Energy Transition Agenda for 2035 Dec. 4, 2025, 1:05 p.m. Editorial Analysis", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

Farewell to the Equalisation Levy - A Bold Move in Global Taxation March 28, 2025 Context: The government has proposed the abolition of the 6% Equalisation Levy on online advertising in the Finance Bill 2025, reducing the tax burden on digital ad consumers and lowering costs on platforms like Google and Meta. This is a significant move in the context of the ongoing Indo-US bilateral trade talks , and the imminent threat of reciprocal tax, which is likely to come into force from 2nd April, 2025. If passed in parliament, the 6% Equalisation Levy would cease to exist from 1 April 2025 . The origins of the equalisation levy have generated interest as we say goodbye to it. The Genesis of Equalisation Levy: Introduced in 2016 via the Finance Act, rather than the Income-tax Act, to avoid treaty override. Aimed at taxing online advertising revenues earned by foreign digital companies in India. Large multinational digital corporations opposed the levy, citing double taxation concerns . The Global Taxation Landscape: International tax efforts sought to close loopholes but lacked consensus on digital taxation. The OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative left digital taxation unresolved. India was the first country to impose such a tax, despite criticisms of unilateralism. Other countries followed suit, leading the US to intervene. International Negotiations and the Role of OECD & UN: Dispute over profit allocation: US preferred taxation only on residual returns. India advocated for formulary apportionment. OECD attempted a consensus-driven approach but faced US influence. Growing discontent among developing nations led to UN intervention . In 2024, 110 countries supported an UN-led international tax convention. The UN\u2019s proposal for a withholding tax on digital services faced obstacles similar to OECD\u2019s. US Opposition and Trade Disputes: In 2020, the US launched investigations under USTR, calling India\u2019s levy discriminatory. The US threatened retaliatory tariffs , leading to India\u2019s withdrawal of a similar levy of 2% on digital e-commerce supplies and services. With Donald Trump\u2019s return , trade tensions resurfaced, likely prompting the 6% levy\u2019s removal. Impact and Future of Digital Taxes: India collected \u20b940 billion from the levy in 2022. Critics argue the tax burden was passed on to consumers , though evidence is lacking. The withdrawal raises concerns as there is still no global tax framework in place . Despite its discontinuation, the equalisation levy showcased India\u2019s ability to assert its economic interests independently of global consensus. Conclusion: The withdrawal of the equalisation levy marks the end of India\u2019s bold attempt to tax digital giants in the absence of a global consensus. While the levy served as an effective tool to ensure fair taxation, geopolitical pressures , particularly from the US, played a crucial role in its rollback. The episode highlights the complexities of international tax diplomacy , where developing nations like India must navigate economic interests while asserting their sovereignty. As global negotiations continue, the future of digital taxation remains uncertain , but India's pioneering approach has set a precedent for alternative models of taxation beyond OECD-driven frameworks.

Fixing India\u2019s Highway Black Spots: Panel Calls for Urgent Action March 29, 2025 Why in the News? The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism and Culture has criticised the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) for the persistent existence of accident-prone \u201cblack spots\u201d on national highways (NHs). What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Background (Context, About Black Spots) Parliamentary Panel\u2019s Report (Key Findings, Action Plan, Audits, Targets vs Actuals, etc.) Background: India has one of the highest numbers of road accidents in the world. A significant portion of these fatalities happen on national highways (NHs) due to poorly designed or managed road segments called \u201cblack spots\u201d , specific locations where a high number of accidents and fatalities have been recorded over the years. Despite various efforts by the MoRTH to reduce road deaths, a recent report by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism and Culture reveals worrying gaps in execution. According to MoRTH\u2019s own data, out of 13,795 black spots identified across India\u2019s NHs, long-term rectification has been completed on only 5,036 spots. This translates to a large number of dangerous zones still unaddressed , posing daily risks to drivers and pedestrians. About Black Spots: A \u201cblack spot\u201d is a hazardous location on a national highway identified by the frequency and severity of road accidents, particularly those causing grievous injuries or deaths across three consecutive years . These spots can occur due to poor road design, lack of signage, bad lighting, sharp curves, or congested junctions. Parliamentary Panel\u2019s Findings: A Governance Failure In a report related to the Demands for Grants for FY 2025-26 , the parliamentary panel called the poor progress a \u201csignificant governance failure\u201d . It emphasised that these black spots represent preventable dangers that could be fixed with faster, coordinated intervention. The committee expressed deep concern about the mismatch between the ministry\u2019s commitments and the reality on the ground. Three-Tier Action Plan for Fixing Black Spots: To address the issue, the panel has recommended a three-tier prioritisation framework based on: Severity (how often and how serious the accidents are), Complexity of the fix required , and Population exposure (how many people use the spot regularly). The plan includes strict time-bound interventions : Category A black spots (highest risk): Temporary safety measures must be deployed immediately. Permanent rectification must begin within 30 days of identification. Category B black spots (moderate risk): Must be fixed within 90 days . Category C black spots (lower priority): Deadline of 180 days . Agencies that fail to meet the timelines should face penalties . Need for Post-Implementation Audits: The panel didn\u2019t just focus on fixing black spots, it also highlighted the importance of follow-up . It recommended that safety audits be carried out at 3-month and 12-month intervals after rectification to ensure the solutions actually work. To promote accountability , the panel suggested creating a public dashboard that would show the status of each black spot, the progress of rectification, and the responsible implementing agency. MoRTH\u2019s Targets and Reality: The ministry has set an ambitious goal to reduce road fatalities by 95% by 2028 . As part of this, it has committed to fixing 1,000 black spots in FY 2025\u201326 and eliminating all identified black spots by FY 2027-28 through better signage, road design, and junction management. However, the numbers so far reflect a lag in long-term fixes : Short-term solutions (like installing signage, speed breakers, or barriers) are often implemented, but long-term structural fixes , such as underpasses, road widening, or redesign\u2014remain slow. Conclusion: Fixing black spots on national highways isn\u2019t just a technical challenge, it\u2019s a matter of saving lives . The current pace of work is not in sync with the ministry\u2019s stated ambitions. The parliamentary panel\u2019s recommendations provide a clear and actionable path forward , focusing on urgency, accountability, and transparency. To truly make Indian roads safer, quick identification must be followed by equally fast execution , because behind every black spot, there\u2019s a life that can be saved. newspaper.pdf ( Size: 786.0 KB ) Latest Article See All IndiGo Meltdown Dec. 5, 2025, 2:34 p.m. Economics India to Expand Its Busiest Rail Corridors: What\u2019s Planned Dec. 5, 2025, 2:08 p.m. Economics Census 2027 - Counting India, Renewing the Republic Dec. 5, 2025, 1:54 p.m. Editorial Analysis Health and National Security Cess on Demerit Goods Dec. 5, 2025, 1:48 p.m. Economics A Missing Link in India\u2019s Mineral Mission Dec. 5, 2025, 1:33 p.m. Editorial Analysis A Day to Pause and Come Down to Earth Dec. 5, 2025, 1:27 p.m. Editorial Analysis Rupee Breaches the 90-Mark Dec. 4, 2025, 1:36 p.m. Economics Putin\u2019s Visit: India\u2013R", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

The '3Cs' That Haunt Indian Education Today March 31, 2025 Context The introduction of the National Education Policy ( NEP ) 2020 was presented as a landmark reform in India's education system. However, beneath its promises of transformation, the policy masks deeper issues stemming from the government's approach to education. Over the last decade, the Union Government has consistently demonstrated an alarming indifference to the true needs of students and educators. This negligence is reflected in three primary areas: the centralisation of power, the commercialisation of education, and the communalisation of curricula. Brazen Centralisation: A Threat to Federalism Increasing Centralisation One of the most concerning aspects of the Union Government\u2019s education policy has been the increasing centralisation of decision-making. The Central Advisory Board of Education , which was supposed to ensure collaboration between the Union and State governments, has not met since September 2019. Despite implementing a major policy shift through NEP 2020, the government has not engaged in meaningful consultation with the states. This disregard for federal principles is particularly problematic because education is a subject under the Concurrent List of the Indian Constitution, meaning both the central and state governments have a role in shaping education policy. Heavy-Handed Approach Further evidence of this heavy-handed approach is seen in the PM-SHRI scheme, where the Union Government has allegedly withheld Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) funds to pressure states into compliance. These funds, crucial for implementing the Right to Education (RTE) Act, are being used as leverage to force state governments to align with central policies. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Education has even condemned this coercive tactic, calling for the unconditional release of SSA funds. Centralisation of Higher Education The centralisation of higher education governance is equally troubling. The draft University Grants Commission (UGC) guidelines for 2025 effectively strip state governments of their authority in appointing vice-chancellors in universities funded and operated by them. This shift in power toward the Union Government, facilitated through Governors who act as Chancellors , undermines the autonomy of state universities and threatens the federal structure of governance in education. The Rise of Commercialisation: Education as a Privilege Privatisation of Schools Another major issue plaguing India\u2019s education system is its growing commercialization. NEP 2020, while claiming to promote inclusive education, has in reality accelerated the privatisation of schools. The policy\u2019s emphasis on \u2018school complexes\u2019 undermines the foundational principles of the Right to Education Act, which guarantees access to nearby primary and upper-primary schools. Instead of strengthening the public school system, the government has closed nearly 90,000 public schools since 2014 while allowing a sharp rise in private schools. This shift has disproportionately harmed the poor, forcing them into an expensive and often unregulated private education system. Privatisation of Higher Education In higher education, a similar trend is evident with the introduction of the Higher Education Financing Agency (HEFA). Replacing traditional block grants from the UGC, HEFA offers loans at market rates, which universities must repay using their own revenues, primarily student fees. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Education has reported that universities are increasingly burdened with repaying these loans through fee hikes , thereby shifting the financial strain onto students. This policy effectively turns higher education into a privilege accessible only to those who can afford it , eroding the principle of affordable public education. Moreover, the rise of financial corruption in educational institutions is closely tied to this commercialisation . Incidents such as bribery scandals in the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) and inefficiencies in the National Testing Agency (NTA) highlight the growing mismanagement and political interference in education governance. Communalisation of Education: Rewriting History The third and perhaps most dangerous aspect of the current education policy is the ideological reshaping of curricula . The Government has made deliberate efforts to revise textbooks and syllabi to promote a particular historical and cultural narrative. The removal of references to Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s assassination , Mughal history, and even the Preamble of the Indian Constitution from school textbooks is a clear indication of this trend. Public outrage eventually led to the reinstatement of the Preamble , but the larger pattern of historical revisionism remains a cause for concern.

The Role of Communities in Conserving Water March 27, 2025 Context On World Water Day (March 22, 2025), Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasised the necessity of collective action for water conservation, highlighting the importance of securing water resources for present and future generations. Coinciding with this, the Ministry of Jal Shakti launched the Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain 2025, a campaign that underscores the need for community participation in water management. While such initiatives reflect a growing awareness of water-related challenges, a critical analysis of India's rural water policies reveals significant gaps that need urgent attention . The Role of Communities in Water Management A fundamental issue in India\u2019s water policies is the limited role of communities in decision-making processes. Indigenous and local communities possess valuable ecological knowledge , yet their participation in water governance remains superficial. Current policies largely focus on community involvement in the management of water sources, while decision-making power remains concentrated with state authorities. This restricts the ability of communities to implement their own traditional water conservation method s, leading to a top-down, one-size-fits-all approach that often disregards local environmental dynamics. For instance, Water User Associations (WUAs), introduced in various states since the 1990s, were designed to promote participatory irrigation management. However, while these associations give farmers the responsibility of managing irrigation sources, they lack real authority in shaping broader water policies. This limited autonomy reduces their effectiveness and highlights the need for a more decentralized and inclusive governance framework. Key Issues in Water Governance and Solutions Addressing Water Vulnerability Among Marginalised Groups Water policies must also consider the unequal impact of water crises on different social groups. Subaltern and economically marginalised communities are disproportionately affected by environmental challenges. This is particularly evident among groups that experience both social and economic marginalisation, as they often lack access to adequate water resources and infrastructure. To create equitable water policies, it is essential to ensure the participation of vulnerable groups in water governance. Recognising their agency and traditional knowledge can lead to more inclusive and sustainable water management systems. A truly participatory approach should not only provide marginalised communities with a voice but also equip them with the necessary resources and support to actively shape water policies. Moving Beyond Fragmented Water Governance A major challenge in India\u2019s water management framework is the fragmentation of policies and governing bodies. Currently, different aspects of the ecosystem , such as forests, land, water, and biodiversity, are governed by separate policies and authorities. This siloed approach ignores the interdependent nature of these elements, leading to inefficiencies and unintended negative consequences. A successful integrated approach can be seen in the traditional ecological practices of rural communities in western India. A notable example is the establishment of orans, sacred forests that hold religious , cultural, and ecological significance. Many communities use orans for water conservation, as they enhance tree and grass cover, which in turn traps surface runoff and supports rainwater harvesting. This holistic understanding of ecosystem interdependence serves as a model for future water policies. Instead of fragmented governance, India must adopt an integrated policy approach that recognizes the mutual relationship between water, land, forests, and biodiversity . Incorporating a More-Than-Human Perspective Globally, environmental governance is shifting towards a more-than-human perspective , which acknowledges that nature has intrinsic value beyond human needs. Many legal frameworks worldwide have started recognising the rights of nature , with courts developing jurisprudence that grants ecosystems legal protection. However, India\u2019s water policies remain anthropocentric , focusing exclusively on human water needs. Interestingly, certain rural communities in India have already embraced a more-than-human approach in their water governance. For example, in some regions of western India, irrigation practices are adjusted based on the availability of water for animals , ensuring that ecosystem health is prioritised. India\u2019s formal water policies should learn from these community-led practices and incorporate legal frameworks that protect natural water bodies as living entities rather than mere resources for human consumption.

The discovery of large sums of cash at the residence of Delhi High Court judge Justice Yashwant Varma has raised concerns about corruption in India\u2019s higher judiciary. This incident has strengthened calls for public disclosure of judges\u2019 assets and liabilities, which, unlike other public servants, they are not obligated to reveal\u2014and most have not done so. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Supreme Court\u2019s Position on Judges\u2019 Asset Disclosure Situation in High Courts Regarding Judges\u2019 Asset Disclosure Public Servants and Asset Disclosure Supreme Court\u2019s Position on Judges\u2019 Asset Disclosure 1997 Resolution In 1997, under then CJI J S Verma, the Supreme Court adopted a resolution requiring judges to declare their assets, including those of their spouses and dependents, to the Chief Justice . However, this did not mandate public disclosure. 2009 Resolution In September 2009, the SC full Bench decided to publish judges' asset declarations on its website, but only on a voluntary basis. These disclosures appeared in November 2009, and some High Courts followed suit. Lack of Updates Since 2018 The SC website has not been updated since 2018. It only lists the judges who have submitted declarations to the CJI without publishing the actual disclosures. Former judges\u2019 declarations have also been removed. 2019 RTI Case and SC Ruling In 2019, the Supreme Court ruled that judges' assets and liabilities do not qualify as \u201cpersonal information.\u201d This case originated from an RTI request filed in 2009 by an activist to verify if SC judges had disclosed their assets as per the 1997 resolution. Situation in High Courts Regarding Judges\u2019 Asset Disclosure Low Compliance with Public Disclosure As of March 1, 2024, only 97 out of 770 High Court judges (less than 13%) have publicly declared their assets. These judges belong to seven High Courts: Delhi, Punjab & Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Madras, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, and Karnataka. Most High Courts oppose public disclosure. Resistance from High Courts In 2012, the Uttarakhand High Court passed a resolution strongly objecting to judges\u2019 asset disclosure under the RTI Act. The Allahabad High Court rejected an RTI request for judges' asset details, claiming it was outside the RTI Act\u2019s scope. Similar denials came from Rajasthan, Bombay, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Gauhati, and Sikkim High Courts. Parliamentary Committee\u2019s Recommendation In 2023, Parliament\u2019s Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, and Law and Justice recommended a law mandating the disclosure of Supreme Court and High Court judges\u2019 assets. However, no legislative action has been taken so far. Public Servants and Asset Disclosure Mandatory Asset Declarations Unlike judges, most public servants are required to declare their assets, with this information often being publicly accessible. The RTI Act of 2005 has played a crucial role in ensuring transparency and accountability in government operations. RTI\u2019s Role in Public Disclosure Government officials must annually declare their assets to their respective cadre-controlling authorities, and in most cases, these details are available in the public domain. Several states, including Gujarat, Kerala, and Madhya Pradesh, have strict provisions mandating asset declarations by bureaucrats, which can be accessed through RTI applications. Ministers and MPs Since 2009, it has become standard practice for Union Ministers, including the Prime Minister, to submit asset declarations to the PMO, which are accessible via its website. Many state governments have followed this practice. MPs submit their asset details to the Speaker (Lok Sabha) or Chairperson (Rajya Sabha), and while not publicly available by default, they can generally be accessed through RTI applications. Asset Disclosure for Election Candidates Candidates contesting elections for Parliament, State Assemblies, or Legislative Councils must publicly declare their assets and liabilities as part of the nomination process. This requirement was established by a 2002 Supreme Court ruling mandating asset disclosure for electoral candidates. These declarations are the most detailed among public servants, and even minor errors can lead to the rejection of a candidate\u2019s nomination .

An IJS is an Idea Whose Time has Come March 31, 2025 Context The recent fire brigade incident in Delhi, which led to the discovery of half-burnt currency notes at the residence of a High Court judge, has reignited concerns over judicial accountability in India. Therefore, it is important to critically examine the larger issue of transparency and integrity within the Indian judiciary, particularly focusing on the Collegium system of selecting judges. Moreover, it is crucial to discuss the need for reforms , and the proposal for an Indian Judicial Service ( IJS ) to address systemic inefficiencies. A Persistent Concern Over Judicial Accountability The fire brigade incident, though shocking, is only one among several recent controversies that have cast a shadow on judicial credibility. The Supreme Court\u2019s intervention in staying an insensitive verdict by a High Court judg e regarding a minor\u2019s sexual harassment case further exposes the lack of quality control in judicial appointments. Additionally, the Supreme Court's response to the Lokpal\u2019s attempt to investigate corruption allegations against a judge underscores the judiciary\u2019s resistance to external oversight. These instances collectively reflect a judicial system struggling to maintain accountability while remaining immune to public scrutiny. Flaws in the Collegium System Lack of Transparency The selection and elevation of judges occur behind closed doors , with no formal records, criteria, or explanations made public. The decision-making process lacks objective standards , and the reasons behind selections or rejections are rarely disclosed. This opacity has led to speculation about favouritism, bias, and even corruption within the judicial selection process. The judiciary often declines to share the details of why certain candidates are selected over others , leading to a lack of public confidence. In contrast, other civil service appointments, such as the IAS and IPS, follow a structured and transparent selection process. Nepotism and Judicial Dynasties Since appointments are controlled by a small group of senior judges, there is a tendency to favour candidates who belong to influential legal families. This has led to the emergence of judicial dynasties , where judges' relatives are more likely to be selected over equally or more competent candidates from diverse backgrounds. This practice restricts the entry of talented individuals who do not have personal connections within the judiciary. Studies have shown that a significant number of High Court and Supreme Court judges come from families with a history in the judiciary or legal profession. This concentration of power limits opportunities for meritorious candidates from underprivileged backgrounds. Absence of Merit-Based Selection Criteria Unlike other professional recruitment processes, where clear eligibility criteria, examinations, and evaluations determine appointments, the Collegium system does not have a standardised, merit-based selection mechanism. There is no written test, interview panel, or structured assessment of a judge\u2019s legal knowledge, ethical standards, or past judgments. As a result, the selection process often becomes subjective , favouring those with personal or professional proximity to the Collegium members. In the civil services, candidates undergo rigorous exams and interviews before being selected. However, in the Collegium system, judges are often chosen based on internal discussions with no formal assessment of their judicial competence , integrity, or decision-making abilities. Arbitrary Transfers and Promotions Another major flaw is the opaque system of judicial transfers and promotions. The Collegium decides which judges will be transferred from one High Court to another or elevated to the Supreme Court, but the reasons behind such decisions are rarely disclosed. This lack of accountability has led to suspicions that transfers may be influenced by favouritism , personal biases, or political considerations. In several instances , judges who delivered controversial verdicts or took strong stands against influential figures were transferred to other High Courts without any clear explanation. This raises concerns that transfers are sometimes used as a tool for controlling judges rather than ensuring efficiency in the judiciary. Resistance to External Oversight Despite the criticism, the judiciary has strongly resisted attempts to introduce external oversight mechanisms. The rejection of the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) in 2015 is a prime example of this resistance. The NJAC was designed to make judicial appointments more accountable by involving representatives from both the judiciary and the executive. However, the Supreme Court struck it down , citing concerns over judicial independence. While independence is crucial, absolute autonomy without checks and balances can lead to an unaccountable system.

His transfer comes amid allegations of charred currency notes being recovered from his residence after a fire, prompting Delhi High Court Chief Justice D.K. Upadhyaya to seek an in-house inquiry. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Transfer of High Court Judges: Constitutional Framework and Judicial Interpretation Criticisms of Judicial Transfers in India Striking Down of the NJAC: Reasons and Judicial Verdict Transfer of High Court Judges: Constitutional Framework and Judicial Interpretation Article 222(1) of the Constitution empowers the President, in consultation with the Chief Justice of India (CJI), to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. Judicial Evolution of Transfer Process First Judges Case (1981): The Supreme Court held that the President's consultation with the CJI did not require concurrence, affirming the executive\u2019s primacy in judicial transfers. Second Judges Case (1993): Overturned the earlier ruling, institutionalizing the collegium system and granting the CJI primacy in transfer decisions. The Court emphasized that transfers must serve the public interest and enhance judicial administration. Third Judges Case (1998): Further refined the collegium system, mandating consultation with the four seniormost judges and seeking inputs from Supreme Court judges familiar with the concerned High Court. Process of Transfer The collegium recommends the transfer. The Law Minister reviews and advises the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister forwards the recommendation to the President. Upon presidential approval, the transfer is formalized through a gazette notification. Key Considerations The CJI must consult relevant judges and legal experts to prevent arbitrariness. A judge\u2019s consent is not required for transfer. Judicial review of transfer decisions is limited to prevent external interference. Criticisms of Judicial Transfers in India Concerns Over Judicial Independence The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) has raised concerns about increasing executive interference in judicial appointments and transfers, undermining judicial independence. Lack of Transparency and Accountability Judicial transfers, often carried out without the affected judge\u2019s consent, are justified on vague grounds like \u201cpublic interest\u201d and \u201cbetter administration of justice.\u201d This ambiguity makes it difficult to differentiate between legitimate and punitive transfers. Recommendations for Reform The ICJ has suggested the establishment of a Judicial Council to oversee appointments and transfers based on transparent, objective, and predetermined criteria. It recommends that the council be composed mainly of judges, aligning with international standards of judicial independence. Striking Down of the NJAC: Reasons and Judicial Verdict In 2014, the then government introduced the 99th Constitutional Amendment and the NJAC Act to replace the opaque collegium system for judicial appointments. The NJAC was designed as an independent body to appoint Supreme Court and High Court judges. Composition of the NJAC The NJAC was to be chaired by the CJI and included: Two senior-most Supreme Court judges Union Law Minister Two eminent civil society members (one from SC/ST/OBC or a woman). These members were nominated by a panel consisting of the CJI, Prime Minister, and Leader of the Opposition . Political and Legal Challenges The amendment passed almost unanimously in Parliament and was ratified by 16 State legislatures. However, it was challenged in the Supreme Court, with critics arguing that the veto power granted to any two NJAC members\u2014potentially including the Law Minister\u2014could undermine judicial independence. Supreme Court Verdict (2015) In October 2015, a five-judge Bench ruled (4:1) that the NJAC was unconstitutional , stating that it violated the basic structure of the Constitution , particularly judicial independence. The majority held that the Law Minister and non-judicial members could interfere with judicial appointments, compromising autonomy. Dissenting opinion by Justice Jasti Chelameswar : He criticized the collegium\u2019s lack of transparency, arguing that NJAC could have prevented \" unwholesome trade-offs\" and \"incestuous accommodations\" between the judiciary and executive. The verdict restored the collegium system , reinforcing the judiciary\u2019s primacy in appointments but leaving concerns over transparency unresolved.

Calls for GST 2.0 Grow Stronger Amidst Compliance Challenges and Refund Delays March 30, 2025 Why in the News? In a report to Parliament, its Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has sought a comprehensive review of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) framework. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? PAC Report on GST (Context, Key Issues, Delays in Refunds, Suggestions, Way Forward) Background: India's GST, introduced in 2017, was envisioned as a game-changer to unify India\u2019s fragmented indirect tax system . However, nearly eight years later, a Parliamentary report has highlighted deep-rooted issues in GST implementation that impact businesses, State finances, and the overall efficiency of the tax system. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) , in its latest report to Parliament, has called for a comprehensive overhaul of the GST system , a \u201cGST 2.0\u201d, to reduce complexity, improve transparency, and enhance ease of compliance. Compensation to States Remains a Key Concern: One of the biggest concerns flagged by the PAC is the lack of transparency and audit in the disbursal of GST compensation to States. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has not audited the GST Compensation Fund for over six years, reportedly due to the non-submission of proper financial data by the Ministry of Finance . This has hampered the release of compensation amounts to several States that heavily rely on these funds, especially industrial States like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka , which feared revenue loss under GST. Further, a review of 10,667 cases showed 2,447 inconsistencies, and around \u20b932,577 crore remains pending , underscoring the urgency for better fund management and auditing mechanisms. Compliance Complexities and Technical Glitches: The PAC noted that several procedural inefficiencies continue to plague GST compliance, leading to either delayed revenue inflow to the government or cash flow constraints for businesses . Key issues include: Confusion over tax jurisdictions delaying refund. Unjustified cancellation of GST registrations: Of 14,998 cases studied, show-cause notices were not issued in 6,353 instances, violating legal norms Registration challenges: Taxpayers are not allowed to withdraw or modify applications, and in some cases, registrations were rejected without clear reasons Delays in Input Tax Credit (ITC) refunds, affecting MSMEs and exporters who rely on regular cash flows The Ministry claimed that some processes have been automated, but the Committee expressed concern over the lack of robust documentation and limited manual oversight , questioning the effectiveness of the automated systems. Delays in Refunds and Their Economic Impact: The report specifically emphasised the inadequacy of the refund mechanism , with businesses experiencing long waiting periods , affecting working capital and daily operations, especially for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and exporters . The Finance Ministry responded by promising improvements, including clearer timelines for refund processing and more real-time updates on the status of refund applications . The upcoming \u2018Antarang Portal\u2019 is expected to centralise filing, tracking, and documentation to enhance transparency. Need for Institutional Reforms: The report also highlighted the absence of a functional GST Appellate Tribunal , causing legal bottlenecks and prolonged pendency in dispute resolution. As of March 2022, over 19,730 cases involving tax implications of \u20b91.45 lakh crore were pending investigation. Legal experts argue that these unresolved cases, many of which have been pending for more than two years, hamper both compliance and business confidence. Way Forward: Recommendations for GST 2.0 Public Accounts Committee has recommended the government undertake a comprehensive stakeholder consultation to roll out GST 2.0 , focusing on: Simplifying compliance by removing unnecessary procedures Ensuring timely audits and release of compensation to States Establishing the long-awaited GST Appellate Tribunal Improving digital platforms for registration, refunds, and returns Prioritising ITC refund processing , especially for MSMEs and exporters A tiered approach could be explored to allow differentiated compliance requirements for large corporates, mid-sized firms, and small traders to make the system more inclusive. Conclusion: GST was introduced as India\u2019s biggest indirect tax reform, but implementation gaps and systemic inefficiencies have created avoidable hurdles for businesses and State governments alike. While digital initiatives like the Antarang Portal and automation of notices are steps in the right direction, only a comprehensive revamp backed by regular audits, robust grievance redressal, and stakeholder consultation can unlock GST\u2019s true potential.

The Judiciary\u2019s \u2018Between a Rock and Hard Place\u2019 Moment March 28, 2025 Context The case involving Justice Yashwant Varma is a striking example of the complexities surrounding judicial integrity, government intervention, and the broader debate over the appointment and accountability of judges in India. This incident, which began as a suspicious fire at the judge\u2019s official residence, quickly escalated into a national controversy , leading to an investigation and reigniting debates over judicial appointments and government influence. Therefore, it is important to analyse the case, its implications for judicial independence, and the larger issue of corruption within the judiciary. The Case and Its Immediate Fallout The controversy began when an accidental fire in an outhouse at Justice Varma\u2019s official residence in New Delhi led to the discovery of large amounts of burnt \u20b9500 currency notes. With Justice Varma out of town at the time, questions arose regarding the source and purpose of the money. The Delhi police chief reported the incident to the Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court , who then informed the Chief Justice of India (CJI). The CJI took swift action by calling a Collegium meeting and transferring Justice Varma back to the Allahabad High Court. However, the situation escalated when public outrage over the incident led the CJI to initiate a formal in-house inquiry. A three-judge committee was appointed to investigate the matter, and Justice Varma was temporarily relieved of judicial duties. Despite his claims that the money was planted as part of a conspiracy, the inquiry\u2019s findings were eagerly awaited as they held the key to understanding the full scope of the incident. The CJI\u2019s decision to make all findings public was seen as a positive step toward transparency. Government Intervention and NJAC Debate While the inquiry into Justice Varma\u2019s case was ongoing, the government seized the opportunity to revisit its longstanding efforts to exert greater control over judicial appointments. The Vice President of India initiated discussions with political leaders on reinstating the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC), an act that had previously been struck down by the Supreme Court for violating the Constitution\u2019s basic structure doctrine. The NJAC was designed to include government representatives in judicial appointments , a move seen as undermining judicial independence. The Supreme Court had ruled against it on the grounds that government involvement in appointments would compromise the impartiality of the judiciary. Nevertheless, the government has persistently sought to exert influence over the Collegium system, often delaying or rejecting judicial recommendations without justification. The Government\u2019s Role in Judicial Appointments The Modi government\u2019s interference in judicial appointments has been a recurring concern. Despite legal provisions that mandate the Collegium\u2019s recommendations be honoured, the government has used procedural delays to block the appointment of independent judges . By selectively approving only those judges aligned with its ideology , the government has undermined the judiciary\u2019s independence. The Justice Varma case has provided the government with another opportunity to question the current appointment process. If the government succeeds in reinstating the NJAC, it would further erode judicial autonomy, placing it under political control. Given the government\u2019s track record of suppressing dissent and controlling institutions, this move raises significant concerns about the future of judicial impartiality. The Larger Issue of Corruption and Judicial Accountability The Scope of Corruption in the Judiciary Judicial corruption is a serious concern in India , where the integrity of the judiciary is fundamental to upholding the rule of law and ensuring democratic governance. Allegations of corruption among judges, including bribery, favouritism, and political influence, have surfaced multiple times, eroding public trust in the judicial system. Cases like that of Justice Yashwant Varma raise important questions about how deeply corruption may be embedded in the judiciary and what mechanisms exist to address it. While the judiciary is meant to function independently, its closed nature has led to a lack of transparency and accountability. The existing system of judicial oversight is weak , as complaints against judges often go unaddressed due to the absence of a structured mechanism to investigate misconduct. The Justice Varma case highlights the urgent need for reforms in how allegations of corruption are handled. Limitations of the Impeachment Process The Indian Constitution currently provides only one method for removing a corrupt judge: This process is highly impractical and has never been successfully implemented in India's history. Initiating impeachment requires the signatures of at least 100 Members of Parliame", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

U.S. Defence Ties; India Needs to Keep Its Eyes Open March 28, 2025 Context India's defence sector is at a crucial crossroads , balancing indigenous production with strategic foreign partnerships. The Indian Armed Forces have long relied on Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs) , and this dependence has deepened under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat campaign. However, the Indian Air Force (IAF) faces a significant challenge in maintaining its operational strength due to the slow production rate of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). Therefore, it is important to critically examine the state of India\u2019s defence procurement, the implications of U.S. strategic partnerships, and the necessity of safeguarding India\u2019s strategic autonomy. India\u2019s Defence Imports and Indigenous Efforts India remains the world\u2019s second-largest arms importer , as reported by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). While there has been a 9.3% reduction in imports from 2015\u20132019, high-cost and technologically sophisticated weapon systems continue to be sourced from abroad. Despite this, the IAF is investing heavily in indigenous fighter jets like the Tejas Mk1A, Tejas Mk2, and the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA). However, these aircraft rely on American-made engines , making India\u2019s operational capabilities partially dependent on U.S. strategic decisions. Given that Russia supplies 36% of India\u2019s arms, questions arise regarding India\u2019s ability to diversify its supply chain while maintaining technological superiority. U.S.-India Defence Partnership and Comparisons with Other Defence Partnerships U.S.-India Defence Partnership India's evolving defence relationship with the U.S. is a double-edged sword. While bilateral agreements such as the Defence Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI) have promised cutting-edge technology transfer, their long-term impact remains uncertain. The unpredictability of U.S. foreign policy , particularly under transactional administrations, raises concerns about the reliability of such arrangements. The notion of \"partnership\" in India-U.S. defence ties must be scrutinised . As per Professor Anna Simons' perspective, a true partnership is based on \"mutual indispensability.\" The key question remains: Is India indispensable to U.S. strategic interests? Unlike NATO allies or historical U.S. partners, India\u2019s role in Washington\u2019s geopolitical calculus remains fluid, making dependency a risk rather than an advantage. Comparisons with Other Defence Partnerships India\u2019s strategic relationships with Russia, Israel, and France offer alternative models of cooperation. Unlike the U.S., Russia has been a consistent supplier, providing crucial defence equipment, including the Sukhoi Su-30 fighters and S-400 missile systems. Similarly, Israel has contributed significantly to India\u2019s missile defence and surveillance capabilities, while France remains a reliable partner through deals like the Rafale fighter jets. India must evaluate whether its defence relationships are built on long-term political indispensability or short-term transactional exchanges. The example of the U.S.-Pakistan alliance, which collapsed when Islamabad lost its strategic value, serves as a cautionary tale for India\u2019s approach to defence partnerships. The Necessity of Safeguarding India\u2019s Strategic Autonomy Diversification of Defence Sources India\u2019s current defence procurement heavily relies on both indigenous production and foreign imports. Historically, the country has depended on countries like Russia for advanced weapon systems , but the increasing collaboration with the U.S. in areas such as fighter jets and surveillance technology has created a potential for over-dependence. To ensure strategic autonomy, India must diversify its sources of defence equipment. While India has made significant strides with the development of the Tejas Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) and the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), it must continue to build up its indigenous defence manufacturing capacity. Technology Transfer and Domestic Innovation A cornerstone of ensuring strategic autonomy is fostering technology transfer and encouraging domestic defence innovation. In its current partnerships, especially with the U.S., India has focused on acquiring sophisticated technologies like engines for aircraft (e.g., the GE F414 engine for the Tejas Mk2). However, technology transfer must go beyond simple purchase agreements ; it should include know-how, intellectual property rights (IPRs), and the ability to locally manufacture and upgrade defence systems. India needs to invest in defence research and development (R&D) and enhance collaboration between the private sector and DPSUs. With the active participation of Indian universities, research institutions, and private firms, India can move closer to self-reliance.

A powerful 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar on March 28, causing buildings to collapse in Mandalay and bringing down a skyscraper under construction in Bangkok. The quake, the strongest globally in two years, was followed by at least three aftershocks. The epicenter was 17.2 km from Mandalay at a shallow depth of 10 km. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Cause of the Myanmar Earthquake Earthquake Frequency in Myanmar The Destructive Impact of Recent Earthquake Preparedness of Myanmar Cause of the Myanmar Earthquake The Earth's lithosphere consists of tectonic plates that have been moving for billions of years. Earthquakes occur when these plates suddenly slip past each other, releasing stored energy as seismic waves, causing the ground to shake. Strike-Slip Faulting The Myanmar earthquake was caused by strike-slip faulting between the Indian and Eurasian plates , where the plates moved sideways against each other. The Sagaing Fault The earthquake occurred on the Sagaing Fault, a north-south fault line in Myanmar known for seismic activity. This fault marks the boundary between the Indian plate (moving north) and the Eurasian plate. The movement along this fault triggered the earthquake. Earthquake Frequency in Myanmar Myanmar frequently experiences earthquakes due to the Sagaing Fault . Since 1900, at least six earthquakes of magnitude greater than 7 have occurred near this fault, according to USGS data. Notable Earthquakes January 1990 (Magnitude 7.0) February 1912 (Magnitude 7.9): Occurred just south of the epicenter of the recent quake. 2016 (Magnitude 6.9): Struck in roughly the same area. Major Earthquakes in the Last Century Over the past 100 years, Myanmar has witnessed 14 earthquakes of magnitude 6 or above. The 1839 Catastrophic Earthquake One of the worst earthquakes in the region occurred in 1839 , estimated at magnitude 8.3 . This event is considered the best recent analogue for the March 28, 2025, earthquake. The Destructive Impact of Recent Earthquake Largest Quake in Decades The recent 7.7-magnitude earthquake was likely the strongest in Myanmar\u2019s mainland in 75 years. Previous significant quakes caused casualties but were less severe. Shallow Depth Intensified Damage The quake occurred at a shallow depth of just 10 km, meaning the seismic shockwaves did not dissipate before reaching the surface. This resulted in stronger ground shaking and greater structural damage. Widespread Impact Beyond Epicenter Experts emphasized that seismic waves radiate from the entire fault line, not just the epicenter, affecting a much larger area. Preparedness of Myanmar High Fatality and Economic Risk The USGS Earthquake Hazards Program estimated potential fatalities between 10,000 and 100,000, with economic losses possibly reaching 70% of Myanmar\u2019s GDP. Infrastructure Not Built for Large Quakes Myanmar has not experienced a major earthquake in this region since 1956, leading to poor seismic preparedness. Buildings, especially in densely populated Mandalay, were not designed to withstand such powerful tremors. Geographic Factors Most earthquakes in Myanmar occur west of the Sagaing Fault, while this one struck the central region, which is less accustomed to high-magnitude quakes, further worsening the impact.

House Panel Urges Labour Code Implementation and Revival of Tripartite Dialogue March 31, 2025 Why in the News? The Labour Standing Committee of Parliament has pulled up the Union Labour Ministry for not convening the Indian Labour Conference (ILC) during the last 10 years. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? About Four Labour Codes (Context, Utility, etc.) Parliamentary Panel\u2019s Report (Key Findings, Women\u2019s Participation, Way Forward, etc.) Background: India's labour regulatory landscape underwent a landmark transformation with the consolidation of 29 central labour laws into four comprehensive Labour Codes between 2019 and 2020. The move aimed to simplify the regulatory framework, improve ease of doing business, and ensure wider coverage of social and labour protections to workers across formal and informal sectors. Despite their passage in Parliament, these codes are yet to be fully operationalised due to delays in framing and implementing rules by States. A recent report by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour, Textiles, and Skill Development has urged the Ministry of Labour and Employment to expedite the process and also reconvene the long-pending Indian Labour Conference (ILC). Overview of the Four Labour Codes: The Code on Wages, 2019 This code amalgamates four existing laws related to wages, including the Minimum Wages Act and the Payment of Wages Act. It ensures universal minimum wage coverage across employment types and streamlines payment procedures. The Industrial Relations Code, 2020 This code consolidates laws governing trade unions, industrial disputes, and conditions for layoffs and closures. It aims to create a balance between worker rights and employer flexibility and introduces provisions for fixed-term employment. The Social Security Code, 2020 Covering various benefits such as provident fund, gratuity, maternity benefits, and health insurance, this code brings both organised and unorganised sector workers under a common social security net . It also enables the creation of social security funds for gig and platform workers. The Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020 This code amalgamates 13 existing laws and addresses the safety, health, and welfare conditions of workers across different establishments. It includes provisions for working hours, welfare facilities, and appointment of safety officers. Labour Code Implementation and Revival of Tripartite Dialogue: In its report tabled in Parliament, the committee highlighted delays and inconsistencies in the implementation of these labour codes. Progress on Rulemaking As of early 2024, 32 States and Union Territories had pre-published rules under all four codes. However, States like West Bengal and Lakshadweep had not done so. The committee noted that rule publication does not equate to enforcement and stressed the need for actual on-ground implementation , supported by administrative readiness and awareness drives. Tripartite Consultations and the Indian Labour Conference The committee criticised the Ministry for not holding the Indian Labour Conference (ILC) since 2015. The ILC is India\u2019s primary platform for tripartite dialogue between government, employers, and worker unions. The committee argued that such a forum is vital, particularly during structural reforms like the rollout of the labour codes. Despite multiple requests by trade unions and stakeholders, the Ministry had not shared any timeline for the next ILC session. The committee emphasised that informal or bilateral consultations cannot replace the institutional significance of the ILC. Women\u2019s Participation in the Workforce: On a positive note, the committee highlighted the rising Worker Population Ratio (WPR) among women , citing data from the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS). Women's WPR rose from 28.7% in 2019\u201320 to 40.3% in 2023\u201324 , a significant shift driven by policy interventions, digital job platforms, and increased awareness. To sustain and build on this trend, the panel recommended: Special employment outreach in rural, tribal, and underdeveloped areas Active promotion of the National Career Services (NCS) portal Greater efforts by industries to encourage female workforce participation through flexible work options Way Forward: The committee\u2019s report strongly advocated for: Expedited implementation of the four labour codes through close coordination with State governments Resumption of the Indian Labour Conference to ensure inclusive policymaking Capacity-building efforts for labour officials to ensure effective rule enforcement Data-driven monitoring mechanisms to evaluate the real-world impact of the labour reforms Given India\u2019s rapidly changing employment landscape, marked by gig work, platform-based jobs, and informal labour, such reforms are critical to ensuring worker protection, job formalisation, and economic inclusivity . newspaper.pdf ( Size: 289.8 KB ) Latest Article See All Ind", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

India\u2019s Geopolitical Vision Should be Larger March 29, 2025 Context India has historically been an influential global player , balancing economic growth with diplomatic relations. However, recent geopolitical shifts have raised concerns about India\u2019s limited role in resolving international conflicts. While India has taken decisive action in regional crises, such as its interventions in Bangladesh (1971), the Maldives (1988), and Sri Lanka (2009), it has recently adopted a cautious stance. The question arises: should India be more proactive in global geopolitics? Experts argue that India must recalibrate its foreign policy, balancing economic ambitions with strategic engagement to secure its position as a major global power. India\u2019s Historical and Current Diplomatic Approach India\u2019s leadership in the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) reflected its early commitment to shaping global politics. In contrast, its current multi-alignment strategy prioritises bilateral ties over collective geopolitical influence. India has made significant contributions to global welfare through initiatives like \u2018Vaccine Maitri,\u2019 climate action, and humanitarian aid. However, its reluctance to actively engage in major conflicts, such as the Russia-Ukraine war or the Israel-Palestine crisis, raises questions about its long-term vision as a global power. Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s diplomatic outreach to Russia and Ukraine has been commendable , but India has largely remained a bystander in peace negotiations. Its abstention from UNSC votes on the Ukraine war influenced developing nations, yet India has not capitalised on its unique position to mediate effectively. Given its economic and diplomatic credibility, should India not aspire for a seat at the \u201chigh table\u201d of global conflict resolution? The Risks of Remaining Passive Ceding Influence to Emerging Middle Powers In the absence of Indian leadership, other nations are stepping in to fill the diplomatic vacuum. Countries like T\u00fcrkiye, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar have taken on active mediation roles in various conflicts, thereby expanding their geopolitical influence. T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s Role in the Ukraine-Russia Conflict T\u00fcrkiye hosted direct negotiations between Ukraine and Russia in 2022 , demonstrating its ability to mediate in European conflicts. This enhanced T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s credibility as a neutral broker and strengthened its diplomatic standing. Saudi Arabia\u2019s Multi-Alignment Strategy Saudi Arabia recently hosted high-profile U.S.-Russia and U.S.-Ukraine negotiations, positioning itself as a major diplomatic force. It is leveraging its oil wealth and strategic location to assert itself as a key player in global geopolitics. Qatar\u2019s Mediation in Africa : Qatar successfully facilitated a ceasefire between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo , proving that small but influential states can play a major role in global conflict resolution. If India does not step up, it risks falling behind these emerging middle powers in diplomatic influence. By playing an active role , India could shape discussions on global security rather than merely reacting to them. Diminishing Credibility as a Global Leader India has often projected itself as the leader of the Global South , advocating for the interests of developing nations. However, if it remains hesitant to engage in conflict resolution, it may lose credibility in the eyes of its allies. Expectations from a Rising Power India, as the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy and an aspiring permanent member of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), is expected to contribute more than just statements. If India seeks a leadership role in global governance, it cannot afford to be perceived as indifferent to global crises. Implications for UNSC Aspirations India argues that UNSC decisions lack legitimacy without the world\u2019s largest democracy. However, this argument weakens if India is unwilling to take decisive action in global affairs outside the UNSC framework. The \u2018Not an Era of War\u2019 Doctrine Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s statement to Vladimir Putin that \u2018 this is not an era of war\u2019 was widely appreciated . However, beyond rhetoric, India has not taken concrete steps to push for peace. If India remains passive, such statements may be seen as diplomatic posturing rather than genuine efforts at conflict resolution. Strategic Setbacks in a Shifting Global Order The global balance of power is shifting, with increasing geopolitical fragmentation . If India does not actively engage, it may find itself left out of crucial negotiations that could shape the future world order. U.S.-China \u2018Deal\u2019 and the Risk of Regional Marginalisation As tensions between the U.S. and China evolve, there is a possibility of a new understanding between the two superpowers, dividing regions into spheres of influence. If India does not assert itself, it could be excluded from key geopolitical arrangements in Asia.

Government Report to Delhi HC Emphasizes Content Disclosure and Labelling for Deepfakes March 27, 2025 Why in news? The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) submitted a status report to the Delhi High Court highlighting key concerns about deepfakes . Deepfake technology creates realistic videos, audio, and images. It can change a person\u2019s face, voice, and actions. This can mislead people and spread false information. What\u2019s in today\u2019s article? Regulation of Deepfakes in India Background Government Report on Deepfakes: Key Concerns and Stakeholder Insights Regulation of Deepfakes in India In India, while there's no specific law directly addressing deepfakes . Existing provisions under the Information Technology Act (IT Act) and other laws can be used to address their misuse, such as defamation, impersonation, and copyright infringement. Existing Legal Framework: Information Technology Act, 2000: Section 66D: Penalizes cheating by impersonation using a computer resource, which could apply to deepfakes used for fraudulent impersonation. Section 66E: Addresses violation of privacy, which could be relevant if deepfakes are used to share private content. Sections 67, 67A, and 67B: Prohibit and punish the publication or transmission of obscene or sexually explicit material. Defamation Laws: Deepfakes used to spread misinformation or damage someone's reputation can be challenged under defamation laws. Copyright Act, 1957: Copyright holders can initiate legal proceedings against individuals who use copyrighted material without permission to create deepfakes, with penalties outlined in Section 51. Background Several petitions have been filed in the Delhi High Court seeking regulation of deepfakes and AI-generated content. Three petitions filed Rajat Sharma's Petition (Journalist, India TV Editor-in-Chief) Seeks regulation of deepfake technology. Requests blocking of public access to apps enabling deepfake creation. Argues that deepfakes pose a threat to society by spreading misinformation and disinformation , undermining public discourse and democracy . Chaitanya Rohilla's Petition (Lawyer) Calls for regulations on AI usage , addressing concerns over its unregulated deployment . Kanchan Nagar's Petition (Model) Seeks a ban on non-consensual commercial deepfakes . Advocates for fair compensation for original artists in commercial advertising. Formation of Committee In November 2024, the court instructed the Centre to appoint members to the committee . The MeitY had announced the formation of a committee on November 20, 2024, to address this issue. A nine-member MeitY committee, formed in November 2024, met stakeholders on January 21, 2025. Government Report on Deepfakes: Key Concerns and Stakeholder Insights Rising Threats from Deepfakes Deepfakes targeting women during state elections. Increasing AI-generated scam content, particularly post-elections. Need for better enforcement rather than new laws Lack of a uniform definition for \"deepfake.\" Call for AI Content Regulation Stakeholders emphasized mandatory AI content disclosure, labeling standards, and grievance redressal mechanisms , focusing on malicious actors rather than creative uses of deepfake technology. Debate on Intermediary Liability MeitY's panel proposed mandatory compliance for intermediaries regarding deepfake content. Stakeholders cautioned against over-reliance on intermediary liability frameworks , advocating better investigative and enforcement mechanisms instead of new regulations. Intermediary liability frameworks determine the extent to which intermediaries can be held liable for content on their platforms. The frameworks range from holding intermediaries entirely responsible for the content posted on their platform to complete immunity. A representative from X stressed the need to distinguish between deceptive and benign AI content. Challenges in Deepfake Detection The Data Analysis Unit (DAU), part of the Meta-supported Misinformation Combat Alliance, highlighted: Audio-based deepfakes are harder to detect. Stakeholders underscored the need for collaboration and standard detection frameworks. Law Enforcement and Regulatory Actions The Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) has been tasked with gathering data on deepfake-related cases from law enforcement agencies. Proposed solutions include awareness campaigns via platforms like YouTube. Ongoing Consultations and Next Steps MeitY has requested three more months from the Delhi High Court to complete its consultations. The ministry is yet to consult victims of deepfakes and is collaborating with the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to gather their inputs. Discussions so far have focused more on reactive measures rather than preventive solutions. newspaper.pdf ( Size: 291.4 KB ) Latest Article See All IndiGo Meltdown Dec. 5, 2025, 2:34 p.m. Economics India to Expand Its Busiest Rail Corridors: What\u2019s Planned De", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

However, short-term deposits will continue at the discretion of banks based on commercial viability. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Gold Monetisation Scheme (GMS): An Overview Government and RBI on Gold Monetisation Scheme Closure Gold Mobilised Under the Gold Monetisation Scheme Status of Other Gold Schemes in India Gold Monetisation Scheme (GMS): An Overview Introduced in November 2015, the GMS aimed to make idle gold productive by allowing individuals and institutions to sell or deposit gold with banks. The goal was to integrate gold into the formal economy, reduce gold imports, and lower the current account deficit. It was a revamped version of the earlier Gold Deposit Scheme. Key Features Allowed deposits from households, trusts, and institutions. Minimum deposit: 10 gm of raw gold (bars, coins, jewellery without stones/metals). No maximum deposit limit. Three Deposit Categories Short-term bank deposits (1-3 years) \u2013 Managed by banks. Medium-term government deposits (5-7 years) \u2013 Managed by the government. Long-term government deposits (12-15 years) \u2013 Managed by the government. Gold Monetisation Scheme: Interest Rates Short-Term Deposits Interest rates were determined by banks based on international lease rates, market conditions, and other costs. Interest was borne by the banks. Medium- and Long-Term Deposits Interest rates were set by the government in consultation with the RBI. Interest was paid by the Central government. Medium-term deposits (5-7 years): 25% per annum Long-term deposits (12-15 years): 5% per annum Government and RBI on Gold Monetisation Scheme Closure Discontinuation of the Scheme The Ministry of Finance announced the discontinuation of Medium- and Long-Term Government Deposits (MLTGD) under the GMS from March 26, 2025. Only short-term deposits managed by banks will continue. From March 26, 2025 , no new deposits will be accepted at collection centers, testing agents, or designated bank branches. Impact on Existing Deposits Existing medium- and long-term deposits remain unaffected and will continue until maturity unless withdrawn prematurely. The RBI has not issued a separate release but has updated the scheme details on its website. RBI Guidelines The RBI will issue detailed guidelines regarding the scheme\u2019s closure. It confirmed that the renewal of medium- and long-term deposits has been discontinued from March 26, 2025. Gold Mobilised Under the Gold Monetisation Scheme Total Gold Collected - As of November 2024, a total of 31,164 kg of gold was mobilised under the scheme. Breakdown by Deposit Type Short-term deposits: 7,509 kg Medium-term deposits: 9,728 kg Long-term deposits: 13,926 kg Depositor Participation - Total depositors: 5,693 Gold Collection from Different Sources From individuals/HUFs (FY 2016-17 & 2017-18): 1,134 kg From temples, trusts, mutual funds, gold ETFs, and firms: 10,872 kg Status of Other Gold Schemes in India Gold Monetisation Scheme (GMS) Closure The GMS is the second gold-related scheme to be discontinued after the halt on sovereign gold bonds . The decision comes amid a sharp rise in gold prices, which increased by 41.5% from \u20b963,920 per 10 gm (Jan 1, 2024) to \u20b990,450 per 10 gm (March 25, 2025). Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGB) Discontinued The government stopped fresh issuance of sovereign gold bonds and did not announce any new tranche in Budget 2025-26. Reason: SGBs were considered a high-cost borrowing for the government. Government\u2019s Gold Strategy Officials had earlier stated that SGBs aimed to boost gold investment, but the cut in gold import duty (Budget 2024-25) already aligned with this goal and helped increase demand.

Adivasis in Jharkhand and the Chhotanagpur region will celebrate the Sarhul festival on April 1, 2025 to mark the new year and the arrival of spring. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Sarhul Sarhul: Three-day festival Sarhul\u2019s Transformation Over The Years Significance of Sarhul Sarhul Sarhul is the festival of the New Year celebrated in the state of Jharkhand by the tribal communities as part of the local Sarna religion. It is celebrated in the Hindu month of Chaitra, three days after the appearance of the new moon. It is also a celebration of the beginning of spring. Nature Worship in Sarhul Sarhul, meaning \" worship of the Sal tree,\" is a significant Adivasi festival rooted in nature worship. The Sal tree is revered as the abode of Sama Maa, the village-protecting deity. Symbolic Union of Sun and Earth The festival symbolizes the union of the Sun and the Earth. A pahan (male priest) represents the Sun, while his wife (pahen) symbolizes the Earth, signifying the essential connection between sunlight and soil for sustaining life. Celebration of Life\u2019s Cycle Sarhul marks the renewal of life. Only after its rituals are completed do Adivasis begin agricultural activities like ploughing, sowing, and forest gathering, emphasizing the festival\u2019s deep ties to nature and sustenance. Sarhul Among Different Tribes Sarhul is celebrated by various tribes, including the Oraon, Munda, Santal, Khadia, and Ho , each with unique names and traditions associated with the festival. Evolution from Hunting to Agriculture Anthropologists noted that Sarhul originally centered around hunting but gradually evolved into an agriculture-based festival, reflecting the changing lifestyle of Adivasis in Chhotanagpur. Sarhul\u2019s Journey Beyond Chhotanagpur In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Adivasi communities, including the Munda, Oraon, and Santal, carried Sarhul with them when they were sent as indentured laborers to distant lands. Today, Sarhul is celebrated from Assam\u2019s tea gardens, to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Bhutan. Sarhul: Three-day festival Sarhul is a three-day festival celebrated at Sarna Sthals , sacred groves near villages in Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and Bihar . These groves are central to the festival's rituals. Preparations and First Day Homes and Sarna Sthals are decorated with triangular red and white Sama flags. The pahan (priest) observes a fast, collects ceremonial water, and oversees the cleaning of houses and sacred sites. Sal flowers are gathered for rituals. Main Rituals on the Second Day The main ceremonies take place at the Sarna Sthal, where Sal flowers are offered to the deity and a rooster is sacrificed for prosperity and a good harvest. Holy water is sprinkled, and villagers perform traditional dances like Jadur, Gena, and Por Jadur. Young men also participate in ceremonial fishing and crab-catching. Final Day: Community Feast and Blessings The festival concludes with a grand community feast, where people share handia (rice beer) and traditional delicacies. The pahan blesses the villagers, marking the end of the celebrations. Sarhul\u2019s Transformation Over The Years In the 1960s, Adivasi leader Baba Karthik Oraon, a champion of social justice and tribal culture, initiated a Sarhul procession from Hatma to Siram Toli Sarna Sthal in Ranchi. Over the past 60 years, processions have become a central part of the festival, with Siram Toli emerging as a major gathering point. Political and Identity Assertion Sarhul has increasingly become a platform for Adivasi identity assertion. Some tribal groups use the festival to emphasize their distinctiveness from Hinduism, advocating for the inclusion of the Sarna religion in India's caste census. Debate Over Religious Identity While Sarna followers seek recognition as a separate religious group, other groups argue that Adivasis are part of Hinduism. Significance of Sarhul Sarhul: A Festival Where Nature Takes Center Stage Unlike mainstream Indian festivals that celebrate human achievements, Sarhul Festival honors nature, with the Sal tree as its chief guest. A Festival Without Idols: Pure Worship of Nature Sarhul\u2019s rituals are refreshingly simple\u2014no idols or temple processions, just deep reverence for nature. Preserving Adivasi Heritage in a Changing World As urbanization threatens tribal traditions, Sarhul stands as a cultural movement reinforcing Adivasi identity. A Lesson for Modern Celebrations It teaches that true celebration lies in respecting nature, not in extravagance.

India\u2019s Push into the Deep Sea: A Strategic and Economic Imperative March 28, 2025 Why in the News? Recently, India completed wet testing of its Matsya-6000 submersible , capable of diving up to 6 km below the surface to look for underwater minerals off the coast. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Background (Context of the Article) About Deep Sea (Importance of Deep Sea, Challenges, Suggestions, etc.) Background: India is steadily moving forward in its journey to explore and harness the vast potential of the deep ocean. A key step in this direction was the recent wet testing of Matsya-6000 , a deep-sea submersible developed by the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) under the Samudrayaan Project . Capable of diving up to 6 km beneath the sea surface, Matsya-6000 is part of the broader Deep Ocean Mission , which aims to place India among a handful of nations with human-rated submersibles capable of operating at such extreme depths. However, as per experts, developing deep sea capabilities is not just about science\u2014it\u2019s about economic strength, digital infrastructure, national security, and global competition , especially with countries like China far ahead in this field. Importance of Deep Sea Matters for India: The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) gives countries exclusive rights over natural resources within their Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) , extending 200 nautical miles (about 370 km) from the coastline. India\u2019s EEZ holds massive untapped potential on the seabed and in the water column. Some key reasons why India needs to invest in this domain include: Mineral and energy resources : The seabed holds valuable resources like polymetallic nodules, gas hydrates, oil, and other rare-earth materials that are critical for India\u2019s growing industrial and energy needs. Food and nutraceuticals : Fisheries and marine bio-resources offer economic and nutritional benefits. Oceanographic and climate data : Deep ocean exploration can support climate modelling, weather forecasting, and environmental research. Digital economy infrastructure : Over 95% of global internet traffic passes through undersea fiber-optic cables . Ensuring these cables are secure, well-maintained, and possibly expanded with Indian participation is crucial to the digital economy. National security : Deep sea is increasingly a space of strategic competition . China, for example, recently unveiled a cable-cutting device capable of damaging critical undersea infrastructure. India must prepare with domain awareness, monitoring systems, and countermeasures . Challenges of Deep Sea Technology: Developing deep sea capability is no small feat. The average depth in India\u2019s EEZ is around 3,741 metres , nearly four-and-a-half times the height of the Burj Khalifa. The pressure at such depths exceeds 380 atmospheres , requiring specially designed submersibles and materials. Some key technological challenges include: Communication underwater : Unlike air, sound in water is affected by temperature, pressure, and salinity , making communication difficult. Very Low Frequency (VLF) and Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) sound systems are essential but expensive to develop. Pressure resistance : The deeper the dive, the more robust the vessel needs to be. The OceanGate Titan submersible tragedy in 2023 is a sobering reminder of what can go wrong without rigorous safety and engineering standards. Cost and expertise : Building these technologies demands large financial investments , specialised research , and a highly skilled workforce \u2014areas where countries like China, the US, Japan, and France have made significant progress. What India Needs to Do Next: While the Deep Ocean Mission launched in 2018 is a step in the right direction, experts believe much more needs to be done. Key suggestions include: Create a dedicated Ministry : Upgrade the Department of Ocean Development into a full-fledged Ministry of Ocean Affairs , with a Cabinet-rank Minister to drive coordination and accountability. Boost funding and speed : Approve projects in mission-mode with clear deadlines, adequate budgets, and transparent review mechanisms. Establish centres of excellence : Invest in academic institutions and research labs focused on deep ocean science and technology , encouraging innovation and skill development. Support industrial partnerships : Incentivise private companies to enter deep sea mining, cable-laying, salvage, and submersible development. Create a 10-year roadmap : Formulate a long-term plan with defined milestones across technology, governance, infrastructure, and security. Importantly, the dual-use nature of deep sea technologies, serving both scientific and military goals, makes it essential for India to view ocean development as not just a technical project but a national strategic priority .

India's Textile and Apparel Export Target - Challenges and the Path Forward March 31, 2025 Context: India has set an ambitious target to elevate its Textile and Apparel (T&A) exports from $34.8 billion in 2023-24 to $100 billion by 2030. However, achieving this goal requires transformative reforms in the sector. Current Status of India's Textile and Apparel Exports: India's T&A exports have grown from $11.5 billion in FY2001 to $34.8 billion in FY24 , holding only a 4% share in the global market. The apparel segment (HSN codes 61 and 62) constitutes 42% of total T&A exports. India's global apparel export share has stagnated at 3% , whereas competitors like Bangladesh and Vietnam have surged ahead. China\u2019s global market share has declined from 34.8% to 29.8%, but India has not capitalized on this opportunity. Key Challenges in the Textile Value Chain: Declining cotton production: India\u2019s cotton production peaked at 39.8 million bales in 2013-14 but is projected to fall to 30 million bales in 2024-25 , the lowest in 15 years. India is set to become a net importer of cotton , with imports reaching 2.6 million bales and exports dropping to 1.5 million bales. The ban on next-generation herbicide-tolerant (Ht) Bt cotton , despite Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee ( GEAC ) approval, has hampered productivity. Disproportionate reliance on cotton over man-made fibres (MMFs): The global fibre consumption ratio is 30:70 (cotton to MMF), whereas in India, it is 60:40. High costs of MMF raw materials (polyester, viscose) in India (20% costlier than in Bangladesh, China, and Vietnam) reduce competitiveness. Structural and technological bottlenecks: Around 80% of India's 1 lakh garment factories operate in the decentralized sector , l imiting scalability and technological adoption . Weak integration across the textile value chain restricts efficiency. Trade barriers and market access limitations: High import tariffs imposed by key markets - EU: 9.7% US: 11.47% Bangladesh enjoys zero-duty access to the EU under the \u201cGSP Everything but Arms\u201d arrangement. Vietnam benefits from a mere 1.66% tariff under the \u201c EU-Vietnam FTA .\u201d Strategic Reforms for Achieving the $100 Billion Target: Promoting a fashion-driven industry: Incentivize MMF-based apparel production and remove non-tariff barriers such as Quality Control Orders ( QCOs ) on MMFs. Reduce raw material costs to improve competitiveness. Strengthening the PM-MITRA scheme: Fast-track the implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Mega Integrated Textile Region and Apparel (PM-MITRA) scheme. Enhance scalability and efficiency by promoting integrated textile hubs. Enhancing trade relations and market diversification: Negotiate Free Trade Agreements ( FTAs ) with the EU and the US to reduce tariff disadvantages. Explore new markets such as Japan, Russia, Brazil, and South Korea, focusing on niche segments like women\u2019s western wear and swimwear. Boosting cotton productivity and quality: Streamline GM crop approvals and establish a single-window clearance system for next-generation Bt cotton. Expand irrigation, promote high-density planting, and invest in precision farming to bridge productivity gaps with China (1,945 kg/hectare) and Brazil (1,839 kg/hectare). Conclusion: India's goal of achieving $100 billion in T&A exports by 2030 is ambitious but not impossible. However, bold policy reforms and strategic interventions are necessary to enhance productivity, improve value chain integration, and secure competitive market access. Without these measures, the target will remain a distant dream.

Advantage China in Africa\u2019s Nuclear Energy Market Race March 29, 2025 Context The global energy landscape has undergone significant transformations in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war. As African nations strive to diversify their energy sources, nuclear power is emerging as a critical component of their energy transition. However, this shift has also attracted the attention of global powers eager to secure a stake in Africa\u2019s nuclear market. China, in particular, has positioned itself as the dominant player , challenging traditional Western influence and raising concerns about geopolitical dependencies. Africa\u2019s Nuclear Energy Aspirations Currently, Africa has only one operational nuclear power plant , the Koeberg Nuclear Power Station in South Africa, which was built by a French consortium. However, several African countries, including Ghana, Nigeria, Sudan, Rwanda, Kenya, and Zambia, are actively planning to incorporate nuclear energy into their national power grids. Projections suggest that Africa could generate up to 15,000 MW of nuclear energy by 2035, representing a significant opportunity for investment, estimated at $105 billion. The potential for nuclear energy in Africa is not only an economic opportunity but also a solution to the continent\u2019s chronic electricity shortages and unreliable power supply. The Scramble for Africa\u2019s Nuclear Market Historically, France dominated Africa\u2019s nuclear marke t, particularly in Francophone nations. However, France\u2019s influence is waning as other global powers aggressively pursue nuclear partnerships in Africa. The United States, through the US-Africa Nuclear Energy Summit (USANES) , has sought to establish itself as a major player. However, the future of U.S. involvement depends on the political direction of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. Russia, another key contender, has signed multiple nuclear agreements with African nations , including Egypt, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Burundi. The Russian state-owned nuclear corporation, Rosatom, has been constructing a reactor in El Dabaa, Egypt , since 2022, albeit with slow progress. South Korea, through Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power (KHNP), has also shown interest in Africa\u2019s nuclear market. However, it is China that has emerged as the most influential and aggressive investor in African nuclear energy. China\u2019s Dominance in Africa\u2019s Nuclear Expansion Recent but Rapidly Expanding In 2012, the China Atomic Energy Authority launched a scholarship program in collaboration with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to train African and South Asian students in nuclear science. This initiative strategically familiarised African nations with Chinese nuclear technologies and procedures, increasing the likelihood of future partnerships. Today, China operates more than 50 nuclear reactors , reinforcing its status as a global nuclear power. Growing MoUs Two state-owned enterprises, the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN) and the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), are spearheading China\u2019s nuclear expansion in Africa. In 2024, during the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in Beijing, Nigeria signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with China for the design, construction, and maintenance of nuclear power plants. Similarly, Uganda signed an MoU with China to build a 2 GW nuclear power plant , with the first unit expected to be operational by 2031. Kenya, while still undecided on its nuclear partner, plans to have a research reactor by 2030. Meanwhile, Ghana has opted for U.S.-based NuScale Power and Regnum Technology Group to develop its Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), while China National Nuclear Corporation will construct a Large Reactor (LR). Diminishing Influence of Russia In West Africa, pro-Russian governments in Burkina Faso, Niger, and Mali have signed nuclear cooperation agreements with Rosatom. However, Russia\u2019s economic challenges, exacerbated by sanctions due to the Ukraine war, may hinder its ability to make large-scale investments in African nuclear projects. This could push these nations toward China, which is better positioned to provide financial and technical support. The Impact on India\u2019s Energy Security Africa\u2019s nuclear ambitions have broader implications for global energy security, particularly for India. As India aims to increase its nuclear power capacity from 8,180 MW to 100 GW by 2047 , securing uranium supplies will be crucial. India has previously signed a civil nuclear cooperation agreement with Namibia and is exploring uranium mining projects in Niger and Namibia. However, China\u2019s growing influence in Africa\u2019s nuclear sector could pose challenges for India\u2019s energy security by limiting its access to uranium and nuclear-related infrastructure. Furthermore, many African countries lack the transmission networks necessary to distribute power from nuclear plants.

Gautam Adani U.S. Indictment - Understanding Summons Issuance Under the Hague Convention Feb. 28, 2025 Why in news? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) informed a New York court that it has sought India's assistance under the Hague Service Convention to serve summons on Gautam Adani and Sagar Adani. The Adanis face criminal and civil charges from the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC for allegedly bribing Indian officials over $250 million to advance Adani Group\u2019s solar projects. What\u2019s in today\u2019s article? SEC\u2019s Legal Actions Against Adanis Hague Service Convention India\u2019s Accession and Reservations Conditions for a Default Judgment Under the Hague Convention SEC\u2019s Legal Actions Against Adanis The SEC informed a New York court that it had invoked Article 5(a) of the Hague Service Convention, requesting India\u2019s Ministry of Law and Justice to facilitate summons delivery to Gautam and Sagar Adani. The agency is also considering alternative service methods under Rule 4(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. FCPA Enforcement Paused by Trump Administration Earlier, in February 2025, the Trump administration temporarily suspended enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for 180 days. The FCPA prohibits U.S. entities and individuals from bribing foreign officials for business gains. An executive order mandates a review of ongoing FCPA cases, but the SEC's court filing suggests the pause does not apply retroactively, allowing the Adani investigation to proceed. Hague Service Convention The Hague Service Convention, signed in 1965, facilitates the cross-border exchange of legal documents, including summons, in commercial cases. India became a member in 2006. It aims to ensure defendants in foreign jurisdictions receive timely and actual notice of legal proceedings. Membership and Applicability The Convention applies only when both the sending and receiving countries are signatories . Currently, 84 states, including India and the U.S., are parties. Each signatory must designate a central authority to handle service requests. Permitted Channels of Communication The Convention allows service through diplomatic channels (via the Ministry of External Affairs), postal services, and direct communication between judicial officers or legal representatives. India\u2019s Accession and Reservations India joined the Hague Service Convention in November 2006, with reservations against all alternative service methods under Article 10. India mandates that legal documents in cross-border commercial cases must be served indirectly through a designated authority rather than directly to the individuals involved. MEA reiterates that private judicial officers cannot serve summons directly in India. It prohibits the service of judicial documents through diplomatic or consular channels, except when the recipient is a national of the requesting country. For instance, a U.S. court cannot serve documents in India through U.S. diplomatic or consular channels, unless the recipient is a U.S. national residing in India. Additionally, all service requests must be in English or include an English translation. Role of the Ministry of Law and Justice The Ministry of Law and Justice serves as India\u2019s designated central authority for processing service requests. It can reject a request but must provide reasons, such as concerns over sovereignty or security under Article 13 . However, it cannot refuse service solely based on claims of exclusive jurisdiction or differences in domestic law (Article 29). Conditions for a Default Judgment Under the Hague Convention A default judgment can be issued if a foreign government does not cooperate in serving summons on a defendant. However, Article 15 of the Convention sets specific conditions: The summons must have been transmitted through an approved Convention method. At least six months must have passed since transmission, and the court must deem this period reasonable. No certificate of service has been received despite reasonable efforts through the competent authorities. India\u2019s Position on Default Judgments India has explicitly stated that its courts may issue a default judgment in cross-border disputes even if no certificate of service is received, provided all Article 15 conditions are met. newspaper.pdf ( Size: 342.6 KB ) Latest Article See All IndiGo Meltdown Dec. 5, 2025, 2:34 p.m. Economics India to Expand Its Busiest Rail Corridors: What\u2019s Planned Dec. 5, 2025, 2:08 p.m. Economics Census 2027 - Counting India, Renewing the Republic Dec. 5, 2025, 1:54 p.m. Editorial Analysis Health and National Security Cess on Demerit Goods Dec. 5, 2025, 1:48 p.m. Economics A Missing Link in India\u2019s Mineral Mission Dec. 5, 2025, 1:33 p.m. Editorial Analysis A Day to Pause and Come Down to Earth Dec. 5, 2025, 1:27 p.m. Editorial Analysis Rupee Breaches the 90-Mark Dec. 4, 2025, 1:36 p.m. Economics Putin\u2019s Visit: India\u2013Russia Ties and th", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

China\u2019s Ambassador to India Xu Feihong posted on X (Twitter) about the historic Tea Horse Road which spanned more than 2,000 km, and connected China to India via Tibet. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Tea Horse Road (Historical Background, Utility, Role in Modern History, Revival, etc.) Introduction: The Tea Horse Road , an ancient trade network connecting China, Tibet, and India , played a key role in commerce and cultural exchange for centuries. While less famous than the Silk Road , this route facilitated the movement of tea, horses, and other valuable commodities across some of the world's most challenging terrains. Recently, China\u2019s Ambassador to India, Xu Feihong , highlighted the historical significance of the Tea Horse Road, emphasizing its role in strengthening India-China ties through history. Origins of the Tea Horse Road: The Tea Horse Road traces its origins to the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE) , when trade between Southwest China, Tibet, and India first flourished. Buddhist monk Yijing (635-713 CE) documented early trade exchanges, mentioning the movement of goods such as sugar, textiles, and rice noodles from China , while horses, Tibetan gold, saffron, and medicinal herbs were exported. By the 10th century , during the Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE) , official markets were established along the route to regulate the trade of tea and horses , which became the dominant commodities exchanged between China and Tibet. A Network of Roads Across Difficult Terrain: The Tea Horse Road was not a single pathway, but a network of trails originating in Southwest China and reaching deep into the Indian subcontinent, Nepal, and Bangladesh. Key Features of the Route: Length : Over 2,000 km Key Cities : Passed through Dali, Lijiang (Yunnan Province), and Lhasa (Tibet) Elevation : Reached up to 10,000 feet in the Himalayas Challenges : Harsh terrain, extreme weather, and high altitudes made the journey perilous for traders Despite these difficulties, traders travelled extensively, carrying tea from Sichuan to Tibet and India, while returning with horses and other essential goods. Tea and Horses \u2013 The Core of the Trade: Tea was a necessity for Tibetan nomads , who lived in cold and harsh climates . According to National Geographic, yak butter tea became a staple for Tibetans, providing essential warmth and energy. Meanwhile, horses were crucial for China\u2019s military . Since the central plains of China lacked horses , they had to be imported from Tibet and Yunnan. Tibetan steeds became highly valued , particularly in China\u2019s conflicts against Mongolian tribes. To regulate this exchange, China\u2019s Song Dynasty government established official markets , ensuring a controlled trade of tea and horses, which contributed to regional economic stability. The Road\u2019s Role in Modern History: Expansion of Trade in the Early 20th Century With the fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1912 , the Tea Horse Road became even more vital. Yunnan\u2019s tea industry expanded as China integrated into the global market. New trade techniques and goods were introduced to the mountainous regions, increasing economic opportunities. World War II and the Road\u2019s Strategic Importance During World War II , when Japan controlled much of China\u2019s coastline , the Tea Horse Road served as an alternative supply route for transporting goods and military supplies to China\u2019s resistance forces. Decline After the Founding of the People's Republic of China (1949) Following the establishment of the People\u2019s Republic of China , the importance of the Tea Horse Road declined. Mao Zedong\u2019s land reforms significantly changed trade patterns, and with the advancement of modern transportation, the historic trade route lost its relevance. However, some remnants remain, particularly in regions like Lijiang , which became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997 due to its historical significance in trade. Revival of the Tea Horse Road as a Cultural Landmark: In recent years, China has promoted tourism along the ancient trade route, highlighting its historical importance. The city of Lijiang, once a crucial trade hub , has been transformed into a cultural and heritage site, drawing visitors from across the world. According to UNESCO, Lijiang was an important distribution center for trade between Sichuan, Yunnan, and Tibet , where it intersected with southern Silk Road routes. Today, the city serves as a testament to the Tea Horse Road\u2019s enduring legacy. Conclusion: The Tea Horse Road was more than just a trade route; it was a lifeline connecting China, Tibet, and India for centuries. While its significance has diminished in modern times, it remains a historical and cultural symbol of international exchange. Today, efforts to preserve its legacy through tourism and research highlight its role in shaping the economic and cultural landscapes of the regions it once trav", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

The RTI is Now the \u2018Right to Deny Information\u2019 Feb. 25, 2025 Context The Right to Information (RTI) Act was introduced with the objective of enhancing transparency and empowering citizens by granting them access to government-held information. It was perceived as a means to uphold democratic principles by ensuring accountability and reducing corruption. However, despite its initial promise, the Act has encountered numerous challenges, resulting in a diminished impact. Therefore, it is important to examine the trajectory of the RTI Act, the systemic issues that have weakened its implementation, and the legal interpretations that have further restricted citizens\u2019 access to information. The Initial Promise of the RTI Act The RTI Act was seen as a landmark piece of legislation that recognized citizens as the true rulers of the nation. By codifying the fundamental right to information, the Act provided an effective tool for public oversight, allowing people to monitor the functioning of the government. This empowerment was expected to curb corruption and arbitrariness , leading to a more transparent and accountable administration. The law was hailed as one of the best transparency laws in the world, offering a legal framework for citizens to seek information with dignity and respect. However, the optimism surrounding the Act quickly diminished as the government and bureaucracy resisted this shift in power. Systematic Issues and Judicial Interpretations that Weakened the RTI Act Bureaucratic Resistance and Systemic Erosion One of the earliest challenges to the RTI Act was the reluctance of government officials to relinquish control over information. Recognising that the Act effectively transferred power from public servants to citizens, the government attempted to weaken the law through amendments. However, strong public opposition forced it to abandon these efforts . Despite this, a gradual erosion of the Act\u2019s effectiveness ensued through bureaucratic resistance and judicial reinterpretations. The implementation of the Act was entrusted to Information Commissions , which functioned as appellate authorities. Unfortunately, most of the commissioners appointed were retired bureaucrats, many of whom viewed these positions as post-retirement sinecures rather than opportunities to uphold transparency. Their reluctance to impose penalties for non-compliance further weakened the Act. Additionally, delays in appointing commissioners led to massive backlogs, rendering the right to information ineffective. The mandated 30-day period for providing information was often not adhered to, turning RTI into a tool that provided historical records rather than timely insights. Judicial Interpretations Restricting RTI Central Board of Secondary Education vs Aditya Bandopadhyay (2011) A significant shift in the interpretation of the RTI Act occurred with the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Central Board of Secondary Education vs Aditya Bandopadhyay (2011). The judgment challenged the strict interpretation of Section 8, which outlines exemptions to the right to information. The Court\u2019s assertion that indiscriminate use of RTI could hinder administrative efficiency and national development introduced a restrictive view of the law. This perspective justified the denial of information on broad grounds and cast suspicion on RTI applicants, l eading to an environment where transparency was seen as an obstruction rather than a fundamental right. Girish Ramchandra Deshpande vs Central Information Commissioner (2012) The erosion of the RTI Act continued with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Girish Ramchandra Deshpande vs Central Information Commissioner (2012). In this case, the Court ruled that information about a public servant\u2019s disciplinary records and financial dealings was \u2018personal information\u2019 and therefore exempt under Section 8(1)(j). The judgment did not fully consider whether the information was related to a public activity or if its disclosure was in the larger public interest. By narrowly interpreting the law, the Court set a precedent that allowed authorities to withhold crucial information, effectively converting the RTI into a Right to Deny Information (RDI). This interpretation has been cited in multiple subsequent rulings, further restricting transparency. The Implications of a Weakening RTI Act Reduced Government Accountability and Transparency One of the core objectives of the RTI Act was to make the government more transparent and accountable to the public. By allowing citizens to seek information on governmental decisions, policies, and expenditures, the Act aimed to ensure that public officials remained answerable for their actions. However, the increasing reluctance of Information Commissions to impose penalties , the excessive delays in providing information, and judicial restrictions on disclosure have made it easier for authorities to evade scrutiny.

Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s Visit to India - Revitalizing India-EU Strategic Partnership Feb. 26, 2025 Context: The visit of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to India, along with the entire College of Commissioners (the European Cabinet), marks a significant moment in the evolving India-EU relationship . This visit gains additional importance against the backdrop of Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House, which has introduced fresh uncertainties in global geopolitics . Geopolitical Context - The Trump Factor Trump\u2019s policies are reshaping U.S. relations with Russia, China, and Europe. His approach prioritizes bilateral deals over multilateral commitments. Trump\u2019s stance on Ukraine and NATO has left European nations in a vulnerable position. For example , Trump\u2019s withdrawal of support for Ukraine has shocked Europe. His administration demands that European nations take full responsibility for their security. Washington\u2019s ideological shift , including support for right-wing European parties (for example, Germany\u2019s Alternative for Germany [AfD]), is reshaping internal EU politics . India\u2019s Strategic Calculations: India has historically managed global power shifts by engaging with multiple partners . For example, India\u2019s strategy (until now) for managing US policy volatility has involved maintaining its ties with Russia and engaging in Moscow-led coalitions such as BRICS. This means, India traditionally relied on balancing ties with Russia and the US. With Russia seeking direct negotiations with the U.S., India must broaden its strategic partnerships and recalibrate its strategy amid shifting alliances. Europe emerges as a key player in India\u2019s evolving foreign policy framework. India-EU Relations: A historical perspective: A strategic partnership was declared in 2004 but lost momentum by the early 2010s. Trade negotiations had stalled, and Brussels prioritized commercial ties with China . India revived engagement in 2016 , leading to increased cooperation post-pandemic. Key initiatives include: India-EU Trade and Technology Council India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) Strengthened Indo-Pacific engagement Economic realities and challenges: India\u2019s economic engagement with the EU remains underdeveloped despite clear synergies. India\u2019s trade deficit with China continues to widen, nearing $100 billion annually. The global economic order, once assumed to be stable/irreversible, is being dismantled by Trump\u2019s policies. India must push for economic reforms and reduce dependence on Chinese imports. Key Takeaways from Von der Leyen\u2019s Visit: The visit provides Delhi with the perfect opportunity to revitalise its engagement with the EU - the world\u2019s third-largest economy after the US and China. Strategic convergence between India and Europe can mitigate risks from U.S. unpredictability. A Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and increased bilateral trade remain priority areas. As the EU is a vital source of science, technology, advanced industry, capital, and a vast consumer market, strengthening cooperation in these areas is essential for India\u2019s economic resilience. Way Ahead Towards Strengthening India-EU Ties: Despite their traditional emphasis on \u201cstrategic autonomy,\u201d both Brussels and Delhi have long relied on their partnerships with the US as the anchor of their global strategies. While neither can afford to disengage from the US, both India and Europe must now do more to strengthen their ties in response to Trump\u2019s unpredictable policies. As India recognised Europe\u2019s strategic value in a multipolar world, the EU also moved to \u201c de-risk \u201d its economic ties with China and increase its engagement in the Indo-Pacific region. Conclusion: The changing global order demands a recalibrated Indian foreign policy. With Europe actively seeking to reduce economic dependence on China and India looking to diversify strategic partnerships, Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s visit presents a timely opportunity to solidify India-EU ties. Strengthening this partnership will enhance India\u2019s role in an increasingly multipolar world while ensuring economic and strategic stability.

A Process Where Free and Fair Elections Will Be A Casualty Feb. 28, 2025 Context The Chief Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners (Appointment, Conditions of Service and Term of Office) Act, 2023 is a landmark legislation that establishes a legal framework for the appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and Election Commissioners (ECs). This law was introduced in response to the Supreme Court of India's March 2023 directive , which emphasised the need for an independent and transparent selection process. However, despite its intent to uphold democratic principles, the law has been met with considerable criticism due to concerns about government influence in the appointment process. Historical Context, Judicial Intervention and Challenges to the New Law Historical Context and Judicial Intervention Historically, the CEC and ECs were appointed solely by the President of India based on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. This system raised concerns about the impartiality of the Election Commission of India (ECI), which is responsible for ensuring free and fair elections. Recognising these concerns, the Supreme Court ruled that the appointment process should involve a high-powered committee consisting of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition (LoP) in the Lok Sabha, and the Chief Justice of India (CJI). This arrangement was intended as an interim measure until Parliament enacted a law on the subject. While the new Act adheres to the requirement of parliamentary legislation, it significantly alters the composition of the selection committee. Instead of including the CJI, the new Act introduces a cabinet minister nominated by the Prime Minister. This change has raised serious constitutional and democratic concerns regarding the independence of the selection process. Challenges to the New Law The primary objection to the new law is that it deviates from the Supreme Court\u2019s recommendation by replacing the CJI with a cabinet minister. This alteration effectively ensures a government majority in the selection committee , as both the Prime Minister and the cabinet minister are members of the ruling party. As a result, the appointment process risks becoming a mere formality , with the government having the final say in selecting the CEC and ECs. Furthermore, the process involves a search committee led by the Law Minister , which shortlists five candidates for consideration. The secrecy surrounding the shortlisted names adds another layer of opacity to the process, potentially undermining public trust. The recent selection of the senior-most EC as the CEC by the two government-appointed members of the committee, despite the LoP\u2019s dissent, highlights the predetermined nature of the selection process. Constitutional Concerns and Infirmities in the Selection Process The Constitution of India, under Article 324, entrusts the Election Commission with the responsibility of conducting free and fair elections. The Supreme Court, in Election Commission of India vs. State of Tamil Nadu (1993), reaffirmed that the ECI must function independently to preserve the integrity of the electoral process. Given that India has nearly 960 million voters, the appointment of election commissioners must be devoid of political influence to maintain public confidence in the electoral system. The major flaw in the new Act lies in the composition of the selection committee. By ensuring a built-in majority for the government, the law undermines the fundamental principle of independent decision-making. The inclusion of a cabinet minister, who is bound to align with the Prime Minister\u2014prevents any genuine deliberation over the candidates' merits. Unlike a truly independent committee where decisions emerge through debate, the current structure makes the outcome predictable in favour of the government\u2019s preferred candidate. Another significant issue is the Prime Minister\u2019s power to nominate one of the members , the cabinet minister. Ideally, the selection committee should consist of individuals capable of making independent and unbiased decisions. However, a cabinet minister is inherently loyal to the Prime Ministe r and is unlikely to oppose their decision. This setup further reduces the scope for an objective evaluation of candidates. Broader Implications of the Law: Violation of Constitutional Principles The arbitrary composition of the selection committee raises concerns about the new Act\u2019s compatibility with Article 14 of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to equality. By creating an appointment process that structurally favours government-backed candidates, the law fails to establish a level playing field. The fundamental principle of fairness in selecting high constitutional officers is compromised. Additionally, the independence of the ECI is crucial for ensuring free and fair elections, a cornerstone of India\u2019s democratic framework.

The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) has released the 2 nd edition of the Time Use Survey. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Time Use Survey (Objectives, Key Findings, Implications, Future Outlook, etc.) Introduction: The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) recently released the Time Use Survey (TUS) 2024 , highlighting significant trends in how Indians allocate their time to various activities, including employment, caregiving, and leisure . The National Statistics Office (NSO), MoSPI conducted the first all-India Time Use Survey during January \u2013 December 2019. The present TUS conducted during January \u2013 December 2024 is the second such All-India Survey. A key takeaway from the report is the increase in women\u2019s participation in employment-related activities , signalling a gradual shift from unpaid domestic work to paid jobs. This transformation is a crucial development in India\u2019s labor market dynamics, reflecting economic and social changes. Key Findings of Time Use Survey 2024: Rise in Workforce Participation The participation of women in employment-related activities has increased from 21.8% in 2019 to 25% in 2024 . For men, the figure has risen from 70 . 9% to 75% . This data reflects an expanding economic role for women, although the gender gap in labor participation remains substantial. Decline in Time Spent on Unpaid Domestic Work Women spent 305 minutes per day on unpaid domestic services in 2024, compared to 315 minutes in 2019 , indicating a transition toward paid work. Male members spent significantly less time on such tasks, averaging 88 minutes per day . Women\u2019s Role in Caregiving 41% of women aged 15-59 participated in caregiving activities, compared to only 21 . 4% of men in the same age group. Women spent 137 minutes per day in caregiving, nearly double the 75 minutes spent by men . These figures highlight the continued burden of unpaid caregiving on women despite an increase in their economic participation. Implications of the Changing Work Dynamics: Economic Impact The shift of women from unpaid domestic duties to paid jobs has economic benefits, including: Higher household incomes: Additional earnings from female members contribute to family well-being Enhanced productivity: More women in the workforce can drive economic growth. Formalization of labor: More women entering paid jobs can lead to increased labor formalization and social security benefits. Social and Policy Implications Despite progress, gender disparities in workforce participation persist. The findings highlight the need for: Skill Development Programs: To help women transition into better-paying jobs. Flexible Work Policies: Including remote work and part-time options to balance professional and domestic responsibilities. Government Support: Policies like maternity benefits, affordable childcare, and financial incentives to encourage female workforce participation. Leisure and Cultural Activities: People aged 6 and above spent 171 minutes per day on cultural, leisure, and mass-media activities. Men spent slightly more time on these activities ( 177 minutes ) than women ( 164 minutes ), reflecting the gendered division of time. Education and Self-Care: 89.3% of children aged 6-14 participated in learning activities, spending around 413 minutes per day on studies. Self-care and maintenance accounted for an average of 708 minutes per day across all age groups. Future Outlook and Recommendations: Strengthening Skill Training: Expanding vocational training programs for women in sectors like IT, healthcare, and entrepreneurship. Creating More Job Opportunities: Encouraging industries to hire more women through affirmative action. Enhancing Social Security Benefits: Strengthening maternity benefits, pension schemes, and workplace protections for female workers. Workplace Inclusivity Initiatives: Promoting gender-sensitive policies in both urban and rural employment sectors. Conclusion: The Time Use Survey 2024 underscores a positive shift toward greater female workforce participation in India. While progress has been made, gender disparities remain, necessitating policy interventions, skill development, and supportive work environments to ensure that more women can transition from unpaid domestic work to meaningful employment.

A Leap Backward for Maternity Entitlements Feb. 27, 2025 Context In recent years, several Indian states have prioritised direct cash transfers to women as a form of social security. However, one of the most vulnerable groups, pregnant women, continues to be deprived of their legal right to maternity benefits. While the National Food Security Act (NFSA) of 2013 mandates a minimum financial aid of \u20b96,000 per child , the implementation of this provision has been inadequate. Therefore, it is imperative to explore the shortcomings of maternity benefit schemes in India , the challenges in their implementation, and the need for policy reform. The Undermining of the NFSA Mandate The NFSA explicitly states that all pregnant women , except those in the formal sector, are entitled to maternity benefits. Adjusted for inflation, this amount should be at least \u20b912,000 today , yet even the original \u20b96,000 has not been fully implemented. Instead, the central government introduced the PM Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY), which limits benefits to \u20b95,000 for the first child and recently extended coverage to a second child only if it is a girl. This restriction violates the universal nature of maternity entitlements outlined in the NFSA and significantly weakens the program\u2019s potential impact. Shortcomings of PMMVY Implementation Failures and Lack of Transparency The PMMVY has been marred by serious implementation challenges . Many eligible women are unable to access even the reduced benefits due to bureaucratic hurdles and digital inefficiencies. The Ministry of Women and Child Development provides little information on the program\u2019s performance, undermining transparency. Although Right to Information (RTI) queries have provided some insight, they reveal a dismal picture. Effective coverage of the PMMVY, defined as the proportion of pregnant women receiving at least one instalment, peaked at only 36% in 2019-20 and plummeted to just 9% in 2023-24. The primary reason for this decline appears to be disruptions caused by software changes and overly complex implementation processes. Structural Barriers and Digital Exclusion One of the significant hurdles in accessing PMMVY benefits is the over-reliance on Aadhaar-based payments and digital verification. Many women, particularly those from marginalised backgrounds, struggle to navigate these systems, leading to their exclusion. Technical glitches and procedural complications have further discouraged participation. Instead of simplifying access, the government has introduced additional barriers, raising concerns about whether the administrative inefficiencies are deliberate cost-cutting measures rather than mere oversight. A Comparison of State-Level Success Stories and Lessons for the Central Government Tamil Nadu: A Model for Comprehensive Maternity Benefits Tamil Nadu has been a frontrunner in social welfare programs , particularly in maternal and child healthcare. The state\u2019s maternity benefit scheme , originally introduced in 1987, has undergone several enhancements over the years. Under its current version, pregnant women receive financial assistance of \u20b918,000 per child , a significantly higher amount than the \u20b95,000 provided under the PMMVY. The benefits are disbursed in instalments to ensure continuous support throughout pregnancy and after childbirth. Additionally, Tamil Nadu\u2019s program has been designed with a strong emphasis on accessibility and ease of implementation. The state government has ensured that documentation requirements are minimal, reducing bureaucratic hurdles. As a result, Tamil Nadu achieved 84% coverage of all births in 2023-24, a stark contrast to the PMMVY\u2019s nationwide coverage of less than 10%. Odisha: Expanding Benefits with Political Commitment Odisha\u2019s Mamata Scheme , launched in 2009, is another example of a well-functioning maternity benefit program. Unlike the PMMVY, which restricts benefits to only the first child (with a recent conditional extension to second-child girls), Odisha\u2019s program provides \u20b910,000 per child, covering a broader base of beneficiaries. Ahead of the 2024 general election, the state government decided to double this amount , demonstrating a clear political commitment to maternal welfare. Odisha\u2019s Economic Survey data suggests that the Mamata Scheme achieved 64% coverage of all births in 2021-22, significantly higher than the PMMVY\u2019s national figures. One reason for this success is the state government\u2019s focus on simplified procedures and direct beneficiary outreach. Unlike the PMMVY, which has suffered from digital payment failures and bureaucratic inefficiencies, Odisha\u2019s scheme ensures that funds reach eligible women in a timely manner. Lessons for the Central Government Expand Coverage: The PMMVY should extend benefits beyond just the first child, as seen in Odisha and Tamil Nadu, to provide comprehensive support for maternal health.

Fencing Out Interfaith Relationships in the New India Feb. 25, 2025 Context On January 27, 2025 , Uttarakhand became the first Indian state to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC). While its proponents claim that it aims to promote gender justice , uniformity, and administrative efficiency, its broader implications suggest a legal framework that places personal relationships under state surveillance. Amid these developments, it is crucial to explore how the UCC, in conjunction with anti-conversion laws, curtails personal freedoms , strengthens patriarchal control, and institutionalizes segregation in contemporary India. Challenges Faced by the Interfaith Relationships in India Interfaith marriages in India already face immense social and legal challenges. A 2014 survey of over 70,000 respondents revealed that fewer than 10% of urban Indians had a family member who married outside their caste, and only 5% reported interfaith marriages within their families. Existing laws such as the Special Marriage Act, 1954 , require a 30-day public notice period, making interfaith couples vulnerable to scrutiny and harassment. The situation has worsened with anti-conversion laws in states like Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Rajasthan. These laws impose bureaucratic barriers , including mandatory declarations, waiting periods, and district magistrate approvals. The impact of these regulations is not just procedural but deeply social , emboldening vigilante groups linked to right-wing organisations. A study found that in Uttar Pradesh, 63 out of 101 police complaints filed under the anti-conversion law against Christians originated from third-party vigilante groups. Instead of safeguarding individual rights, these laws provide legal backing for extrajudicial policing of personal choices. State Surveillance and the Criminalization of Live-in Relationships The UCC extends state control beyond formal marriages , reaching into informal relationships. It mandates that live-in relationships be registered with district authorities , requiring couples to submit a 16-page application along with identity proofs. The process includes seeking approval from religious leaders or community heads , notifying family members, and subjecting couples to scrutiny. Non-compliance is criminalised , carrying a penalty of up to six months of imprisonment and a \u20b925,000 fine. Such measures disproportionately affect interfaith couples , who often seek privacy due to social pressures. Reports indicate that only one couple has successfully registered their live-in relationship in Uttarakhand, while others have turned to the High Court for protection. Broader Implications: Empowering Religious Institutions in a Secular State By requiring religious certification for marriage or conversion, the UCC formalises the authority of religious leaders over personal relationships. This contradicts India's constitutional guarantees of individual freedom and secularism, reinforcing the idea that personal relationships must conform to religious and community norms rather than personal choice. Enhancing Familial Control Over Women The legal requirement to notify families of live-in relationships places women at heightened risk of coercion, honour-based violence, and forced separation. Patriarchal narratives often depict women in interfaith relationships as victims of manipulation, further limiting their agency. These legal frameworks thus reinforce family and community control over women\u2019s autonomy. Legitimising Vigilantism Extremists\u2019 groups now have legal avenues to monitor and intervene in interfaith relationships. Public notices and family notifications allow these groups to track and harass couples , often under the pretence of upholding tradition. Instead of protecting individuals, these laws provide a legal shield for extrajudicial policing, increasing communal tensions. A Dangerous Precedent: The Spread of the UCC Model Uttarakhand\u2019s implementation of the UCC is not an isolated incident but a potential model for other states. Rajasthan\u2019s High Court has proposed similar live-in relationship registration requirements, and the state has already enacted an anti-conversion law. Gujarat is also considering a draft UCC based on Uttarakhand\u2019s framework. This trend suggests a coordinated effort to regulate personal relationships through legal mechanisms, threatening India\u2019s pluralistic traditions. Conclusion The implementation of the UCC in Uttarakhand, alongside existing anti-conversion laws, represents an unprecedented level of state interference in personal relationships. By bureaucratising interfaith unions, strengthening religious authority, curtailing women's freedoms, and legitimizing vigilantism, these laws erode individual rights and deepen communal divisions. If similar policies are adopted in other states, India risks institutionalising social segregation, undermining the very principles of democracy and pe", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

AI Has an Environmental Problem Feb. 26, 2025 Context Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an indispensable force in modern society , revolutionising industries, economies, and daily life. With recent advancements in computing power and data availability, AI adoption has surged, driving economic value at an unprecedented scale. The global AI market, currently valued at $200 billion , is projected to contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. However, while AI offers immense economic potential, its rapid expansion also raises critical concerns, particularly regarding its environmental footprint. AI\u2019s Environmental Impact Across Stages Hardware Production and Infrastructure Raw Material Extraction and Manufacturing The manufacturing of AI hardware requires rare earth metals like lithium, cobalt, and nickel , which are mined under environmentally damaging conditions. Mining operations contribute to deforestation , habitat destruction, and significant carbon emissions. Additionally, the extraction of these materials often involves unethical labour practices in some regions. Energy-Intensive Production The fabrication of semiconductors and other AI hardware involves complex chemical processes and high-temperature treatments , consuming vast amounts of energy. The semiconductor industry alone accounts for a notable share of global industrial emissions. E-Waste Crisis As AI-driven systems demand more computing power, the lifecycle of AI hardware shortens , contributing to a growing electronic waste (e-waste) problem. Many GPUs and TPUs become obsolete within a few years, leading to discarded electronic components that contain hazardous substances like lead, mercury, and cadmium, which pollute the environment when not properly recycled. Data Centre Operations: The Backbone of AI Energy Consumption Data centres are responsible for approximately 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). This figure is expected to double by 2026 as AI applications become more widespread. AI models , particularly generative AI models like ChatGPT and DeepSeek, require significantly higher computing power than traditional algorithms, further escalating energy demand. Water Usage for Cooling AI data centres generate immense heat due to their continuous operations, necessitating efficient cooling systems. Many large-scale data centres rely on water-based cooling systems , which consume millions of litres of water annually. This exacerbates water scarcity in regions where such facilities are located. Location-Based Carbon Footprint The environmental impact of data centres is also influenced by their geographical location. Data centres in regions powered by coal and fossil fuels have a much higher carbon footprint than those situated in areas using renewable energy. Companies that fail to strategically place their infrastructure contribute more to global emissions. AI Model Life Cycle Emissions Training AI Models Training state-of-the-art AI models is an extremely energy-intensive process. For instance, GPT-3\u2019s training process emitted approximately 552 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO\u2082-e), comparable to the emissions from nearly 125 gasoline-powered cars over a year. Advanced models like GPT-4 require even more computational resources , escalating their environmental impact. Inferencing and Continuous Operation Once AI models are deployed, they require substantial computational power to process user queries and make real-time predictions. This is known as inferencing , which can sometimes consume 10\u2013100 times more energy than earlier AI models. Since these models run continuously on cloud servers, their energy consumption compounds over time. Data Storage and Retrieval AI models rely on massive datasets that require ongoing storage and retrieval , further increasing energy usage. Maintaining these vast datasets i nvolves constant processing and updating, which contributes to sustained power consumption. Model Retirement and Re-training Unlike traditional software that can run for years with periodic updates, AI models often require retraining as new data becomes available. Each retraining cycle demands significant computational resources , leading to recurring carbon emissions. The Global Response to AI\u2019s Environmental Challenges As awareness of AI\u2019s environmental impact grows, global discussions on sustainable AI practices have gained momentum. At COP29, the International Telecommunication Union emphasised the need for greener AI solutions, urging businesses and governments to integrate sustainability into their AI strategies. More than 190 countries have adopted ethical AI recommendations that address environmental concerns, and legislative efforts in the European Union and the U.S. aim to curb AI\u2019s carbon footprint. However, despite these initiatives, concrete policies remain scarce.

Human Smuggling Must Engage Parliament\u2019s Attention Feb. 26, 2025 Context Human smuggling remains a grave humanitarian crisis affecting thousands of Indians who seek better opportunities abroad through illegal channels. The loopholes of existing legal frameworks, particularly the Emigration Act, 1983 and the Punjab Travel Professionals Regulation Act, 2012, highlights the inefficiencies in tackling this growing menace. Therefore, it is crucial to explore the socio-economic factors behind irregular migration, the exploitative nature of human smuggling networks , the existing legislative gaps, and the need for a robust national legal framework. The Dark Reality of Human Smuggling The Role of Human Smugglers: Preying on Desperation The illegal migration network is a well-organised system involving travel agents , document forgers, corrupt officials, and international criminal syndicates. These smugglers operate openly in rural India , targeting vulnerable individuals and their families with false promises. They charge exorbitant sums, often several lakhs of rupees, under the pretext of securing visas, work permits, or direct job placements. Many families sell their land, jewellery, or take massive loans to fund these journeys, believing that their loved ones will achieve prosperity abroad. However, once these migrants leave India, their nightmare begins. Many are sent through dangerous routes, including forests, deserts, or even war zones. Some are crammed into overcrowded boats, hidden inside trucks, or locked inside shipping containers for days without food or water. A significant number do not survive the journey , dying from suffocation, dehydration, or drowning. The Inhumane Conditions Faced by Migrants For those who do make it to their destination , the suffering continues. Without proper documentation, they are at the mercy of traffickers and employers who treat them as modern-day slaves. Many are forced into: Backbreaking, unpaid labour on construction sites, farms, or factories. Sex trafficking and forced prostitution , especially in the case of women and young girls. Working under extreme conditions in war-torn regions , such as clearing ammunition fields in Iraq. Detention and deportation, often in shackles , after being caught by immigration authorities. Survivors have narrated horrific accounts of their journeys. Some were made to sit in piles of human waste, while others watched fellow migrants die beside them, their bodies dumped on roadsides or into the ocean. Many end up stranded, with no legal rights, no money, and no way to return home. The Psychological and Social Toll Beyond the physical dangers, illegal migration leaves deep psychological scars. Migrants who return after being deported face humiliation, shame, and economic ruin. Families who invested their life savings in these journeys are often left in debt traps, struggling to recover financially. The stigma surrounding failed migration leads to social isolation, and in extreme cases, some returnees even resort to suicide. The Globalization of Human Smuggling The smuggling of migrants is no longer just an issue of small-scale fraud ; it has evolved into a globalised criminal enterprise. International mafias and trafficking syndicates coordinate across borders, using fake documents, underground transport networks, and bribery to move people illegally. Due to low detection rates and weak legal frameworks, smuggling has become an extremely profitable and low-risk business for criminals. Gaps in Existing Laws and Challenges in Law Enforcement The Emigration Act, 1983: An Outdated and Ineffective Law The law was enacted to regulate the movement of Indian citizens abroad, particularly for employment purposes. It sought to prevent exploitation of Indian workers in foreign countries by introducing a system of emigration clearance for those traveling to specific countries. However, the law is outdated and ineffective in the following ways: Failure to Define Human Smuggling The Act does not define or criminalize human smuggling , leaving a massive legal loophole that allows traffickers to operate freely. Since human smuggling is not explicitly recognized as a crime, law enforcement agencies lack the legal authority to take strict action against offenders. Weak Regulation of Recruitment Agents The law primarily focuses on licensing recruitment agents who facilitate legal overseas employment but does not address illegal travel agents and human traffickers. Many travel agents operate without licenses and deceive vulnerable individuals with fake job offers, forged visas, and false promises . Lack of Stringent Punishment The penalties under the Act are too lenient to deter criminal networks. Smugglers often escape with minor fines or short prison sentences , allowing them to resume operations quickly. Organised crime syndicates find it more profitable to continue smuggling people , as the financial rew", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

Trump 2.0 and the New Matrix of U.S.-India Defence Ties Feb. 28, 2025 Context Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s official visit to the United States in February, 2025, marked a significant step in enhancing the U.S.-India bilateral defence engagement. The visit resulted in agreements aimed at strengthening military cooperation , including defence acquisitions and co-production initiatives. However, while these developments indicate progress, they also highlight existing challenges in defence procurement , regulatory alignment, and technological integration. Notable Achievements of PM Modi\u2019s Visit Strengthening Defence Acquisitions One of the notable achievements of the visit was the agreement to expand India's defence acquisitions and co-production efforts. The joint statement emphasised interoperability, particularly through India's planned purchase and co-production of the \u2018Javelin\u2019 Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) and \u2018Stryker\u2019 Infantry Combat Vehicles (ICVs). These initiatives are expected to boost domestic manufacturing and integrate India into the global supply chain for these systems. Additionally, India is set to acquire six more P-8I maritime patrol aircraft to enhance the Indian Navy\u2019s Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA). 10 Year Framework for US-India Defence Partnership A new 10-year framework for the U.S.-India Major Defence Partnership will further consolidate military cooperation in advanced defence technologies. In particular, collaborations in Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and autonomous systems received a significant push. Agreements between companies such as Anduril Industries and the Mahindra Group , as well as the co-development of Active Towed Array Systems (ATAS) by L3Harris and Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), highlight the deepening defence industrial ties between the two nations. Greater Cooperation in Undersea Operations, Space Defence The newly announced Autonomous Systems Industry Alliance (ASIA) is set to promote greater cooperation in undersea systems, fifth-generation fighter aircraft, space defence, and anti-tank missile technology. A review of regulatory frameworks related to arms transfers and the initiation of a Reciprocal Defence Procurement (RDP) agreement will ensure better synergy in defence trade and maintenance. These developments reflect a growing commitment to strategic collaboration between India and the U.S. Challenges in US-India Defence Collaboration Delayed Technology Transfers and Engine Procurement Issues One of the most pressing issues in U.S.-India defence collaboration is the delay in the supply and transfer of technology (ToT) for General Electric\u2019s fighter jet engines. The joint statement following Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit made no mention of the urgent delivery of GE Aerospace\u2019s F-404 GE-IN-20 engines , which are crucial for the Tejas-Mark 1A fighter aircraft. These engines are essential for the operational readiness of India\u2019s indigenous fighter jets, yet delays in their procurement pose a serious setback for the Indian Air Force (IAF). Challenges in Fighter Aircraft Procurement and Integration The potential integration of the F-35 Lightning II fighter aircraft into the IAF presents a significant logistical and operational challenge. The Indian Air Force already operates a highly diverse fleet , including Russian-origin Su-30MKIs, MiG-29s, French Rafales, British Jaguars, and the indigenous Tejas jets. Adding the F-35 to this mix would require extensive adjustments in terms of training, maintenance, infrastructure, and weapons compatibility. Moreover, the IAF's Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) project, which aimed to procure 114 multirole fighters, has faced repeated delays since its initiation in 2000. The project has seen several changes , from an initial selection of the Dassault Rafale in 2012 to later negotiations failing due to disagreements over technology transfer and costs. Regulatory and Bureaucratic Hurdles in Defence Trade While India and the U.S. have agreed to review their regulatory frameworks for arms transfers, fundamental differences remain in defence procurement processes. The U.S. follows strict export control laws , such as the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), which can restrict India\u2019s access to cutting-edge technology. Even when deals are approved, they often come with conditions that limit India\u2019s ability to indigenously manufacture or modify the systems. Although discussions are underway to establish an RDP agreement , which would facilitate mutual supply of defence goods and services, regulatory misalignments between India\u2019s Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) and U.S. acquisition mechanisms continue to slow progress. The process of acquiring American defence equipment often involves lengthy approvals from both the U.S. Congress and India\u2019s Ministry of Defence.

Talent Shortage, Global challenge, India\u2019s opportunity Feb. 24, 2025 Context The global labour market is undergoing a significant transformation , and it is evident that the skills required in 2030 will be markedly different from those needed today. This shift presents both a challenge and an opportunity for India. While the world faces an impending shortage of skilled workers, India is uniquely positioned to leverage its workforce potential. However, to fully capitalise on this opportunity, India must address various challenges , including regulatory barriers, skill mismatches, and immigration restrictions. An Overview of The Global Talent Shortage and India\u2019s Potential A recent study by FICCI-KPMG , Global Mobility of Indian Workforce, predicts a global talent shortage of over 85.2 million people by 2030, which could result in $8.45 trillion in unrealised annual revenue. This underscores the urgent need for nations to develop a future-ready workforce. India , with its vast pool of young and skilled workers, has a unique opportunity to fill this gap and contribute significantly to the global economy. However, realising this potential requires strategic interventions at multiple levels, including government policies, international collaborations, and workforce training programs. Key Geographic Regions and Sectoral Demands GCC and Australia: These regions have a strong demand for workers in manufacturing and construction, sectors that require large-scale labour mobility. Europe: As one of the oldest post-industrial societies, Europe has a growing need for service-sector workers , particularly in healthcare, due to its aging population. Emerging Sectors: Across all regions, there is a rising demand for expertise in automation, artificial intelligence (AI), big data, predictive analytics , the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and sustainability. Barriers to Workforce Mobility and Strategies to Enhance Workforce Mobility Barriers to Workforce Mobility Regulatory and Immigration Barriers \u2013 Complex visa processes and stringent work permit regulations restrict skilled migration . Recruitment Malpractices and Trafficking \u2013 Exploitative recruitment practices and human trafficking pose risks to migrant workers, a concern highlighted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Policy Barriers and Skill Mismatches \u2013 Many Indian degrees, particularly in medicine, are not universally recognized, leading to underemployment or unemployment of skilled professionals. Language and Cultural Barriers \u2013 Integration challenges, such as language proficiency and cultural adaptation, affect workforce productivity. Strategies to Enhance Workforce Mobility Bilateral Agreements and Free Trade Agreements (FTAs): Agreements with GCC nations and other key markets aim to protect the rights of Indian workers and facilitate their smooth migration. Skill Development Programs: Government initiatives focus on aligning workforce training with global market demands. Digital Platforms for Workforce Support: Online recruitment systems are designed to prevent exploitation and protect migrant workers, especially in the GCC region. Sector-Specific Skill Training: Training programs must be tailored to meet the specific demands of different geographic regions. Regulation of Recruitment Practices: Stricter oversight of recruitment agencies is necessary to prevent worker exploitation. Recognition of Qualifications: International collaborations should ensure mutual recognition of academic and professional qualifications. Public-Private Partnerships: The private sector should play an active role in skill development and global employment facilitation. Circular Migration and Mobility: Temporary work visas and rotational workforce models can help address labour shortages while maintaining demographic balance . The Political Climate, India\u2019s Resilience and Economic Future and the Road to \u2018Viksit Bharat\u2019 The Political Climate and India\u2019s Resilience The political climate regarding immigration policies is constantly evolving. While Europe may tighten its regulations, Australia remains more open to skilled migration. The FICCI-KPMG study highlights that the Indian diaspora in Australia is one of the largest and fastest-growing. Strict immigration policies mainly target illegal migration, making it crucial for India to position its skilled workforce globally while ensuring legal compliance. Unlike some other migrant groups, Indian workers generally face minimal hostility in international labour markets. However, India must continue efforts to curb illegal migration to maintain its positive global reputation and safeguard its workers from exploitation. India\u2019s Economic Future and the Road to \u2018Viksit Bharat\u2019 India\u2019s ability to capitalise on global labour market opportunities will significantly influence its economic trajectory.

Ensuring Electoral Integrity - The Controversy Over Election Commission Appointments Feb. 24, 2025 Context: India, as the world\u2019s largest democracy, relies on the Election Commission of India ( ECI ) to conduct free and fair elections . Concerns have been raised regarding the appointment process of Election Commissioners (ECs) and its impact on the independence of the ECI. Civil society organizations (CSOs) and political leaders have long demanded a transparent and bipartisan appointment process . The Role of Civil Society Organizations in Electoral Reforms: Several CSOs , including Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), Internet Freedom Foundation, etc. have been advocating for electoral reforms. ADR has been at the forefront, filing legal challenges to reform the EC appointment process. Legal Battle for a Transparent Appointment Process: 2015: ADR filed a petition challenging the executive\u2019s exclusive control over EC appointments, citing concerns over independence. 2018: The case was referred to a Constitution Bench, but hearings were delayed. March 2, 2023: In Anoop Baranwal vs Union of India , the Supreme Court (SC) noted that no legislation outlining the appointment process for these positions had been passed in more than 70 years. This is in spite of the constitutional provision under Article 324(2) that required Parliament to pass a law. It ruled that, until Parliament enacts a law, the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and ECs should be appointed by a committee comprising: The Prime Minister The Leader of the Opposition (LoP) in the Lok Sabha The Chief Justice of India (CJI) The ruling aimed to reduce executive dominance and ensure transparency . The 2023 Legislation and Its Controversies: The government passed the Chief Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners (Appointment, Conditions of Service, and Term of Office) Act, 2023 , modifying the SC\u2019s ruling . The Act excluded the CJI from the selection panel. Instead, it created a new selection committee comprising: The Prime Minister A Union Cabinet Minister (nominated by the PM) The Leader of the Opposition Critics argue that this change undermines impartiality , as the executive holds a majority in the selection panel. Judicial Review and Government Action: January 2024: ADR and other petitioners challenged the 2023 Act in the SC, arguing it allowed the ruling party to dominate the selection process . March 2024: Despite the pending judicial review, the government appointed two new ECs under the new selection framework. February 18, 2025: The incumbent CEC retired, and the government made new appointments via a midnight order. February 19, 2025: The SC was scheduled to hear the case but adjourned it without a new date, prolonging uncertainty. Global Best Practices in EC Appointments: United States: Commissioners appointed by the President with Senate approval. South Africa: President appoints on the recommendation of the National Assembly. Brazil: Appointments made by the Federal Supreme Court. United Kingdom: The Speaker\u2019s Committee on the Electoral Commission (cross-party) makes appointments. France: Joint appointments by the President, Legislature, and Judiciary. Nepal: President appoints CEC and ECs based on recommendations from the Constitutional Council, followed by a parliamentary hearing. Way Forward: The integrity of India\u2019s electoral process hinges on the independence and impartiality of the Election Commission, real and visible . The need of the hour is to embrace a bipartisan and neutral collegium-based appointment system , drawing from global best practices. This would not only fortify the ECI\u2019s autonomy but also bolster public confidence in the democratic process. Conclusion: The 2023 Act has been criticized for reintroducing executive control over EC appointments, despite the SC\u2019s attempt to ensure impartiality. If the government reinstates the CJI in the selection panel, legal challenges could be resolved. The issue remains unresolved, with the judiciary\u2019s role in safeguarding democratic institutions under scrutiny.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah assured that southern states would not lose any parliamentary seats after delimitation, addressing concerns of states like Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Due to slower population growth in the South compared to the North, delimitation based on the latest data could have resulted in a significant increase in seats for northern states. Delimitation, which redraws constituency boundaries, is expected after the delayed Census and was initially set for 2026. In Independent India\u2019s history, delimitation has taken place four times \u2013 1952, 1963, 1973 and 2002. What\u2019s in today\u2019s article? Need for Delimitation Impact of Delimitation on Lok Sabha Seats Concerns of Southern States Over Delimitation Need for Delimitation Delimitation is a constitutional mandate carried out after each Census to readjust the number of seats in Parliament and state Assemblies and redefine constituency boundaries. Article 82 of the Constitution mandates that after each Census, the allocation of Lok Sabha seats must be adjusted based on population changes. However, Article 81 limits the total number of Lok Sabha members to 550, with 530 from states and 20 from Union Territories. It also requires that the ratio of seats to the population in each state be as uniform as possible, ensuring that constituencies across the country have roughly equal populations. The goal is to ensure equal representation by maintaining similar population sizes across constituencies. History of Delimitation in India Pre-1976: After the Censuses of 1951, 1961, and 1971, seats in Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, and state Assemblies were redistributed. 42nd Amendment (1976): During the Emergency, Parliament froze the total number of seats until the 2001 Census to prevent states with higher population growth from losing representation while implementing family planning measures. 2001 Delimitation: While constituency boundaries were redrawn, the number of seats remained unchanged due to opposition from southern states. Impact of Delimitation on Lok Sabha Seats and Elections The number of seats each state receives after delimitation will depend on the base average population that a future delimitation commission establishes. In 1977, each MP represented an average of 10.11 lakh people. Ideally, constituencies should be evenly distributed around this average. Potential Increase in Lok Sabha Strength If the 10.11 lakh average is retained, Lok Sabha strength could rise to nearly 1,400 based on 2025 population projections. UP (including Uttarakhand) could see its seats triple from 85 to 250, while Bihar (including Jharkhand) could increase from 25 to 82. Tamil Nadu and Kerala would see only moderate increases (39 to 76 and 20 to 36, respectively). Since the new Parliament has only 888 seats, this formula is unlikely to be implemented. Experts believe that regardless of the formula, southern states would gain fewer seats compared to northern states, reinforcing concerns over their diminishing political influence. Impact of Delimitation on Elections Regional parties in the South fear that delimitation based on population will benefit parties with a strong base in North India. Concerns of Southern States Over Delimitation Southern states fear that delimitation based on the latest population data will reduce their representation in Parliament, weakening their political influence. Tamil Nadu CM M.K. Stalin announced an all-party meeting on March 5 to discuss delimitation, calling it a looming threat to southern states. He warned that Tamil Nadu could lose parliamentary seats due to its success in family planning.

Recently, Microsoft announced Majorana 1, a new quantum computing chip developed using engineered particles in a new state of matter, which the company sees as a breakthrough. With this Microsoft aims to develop quantum computers capable of solving industrial-scale problems within years (2027-29) rather than decades. Though, the company has not released any performance data on its quantum chip yet. What\u2019s in today\u2019s article? Microsoft\u2019s Unique Approach to Quantum Computing Majorana 1 Quantum Computers vs Supercomputers vs Classical Computers Microsoft\u2019s Unique Approach to Quantum Computing For the past 20 years, Microsoft has focused on developing topological qubits, which are more stable and require less error correction than traditional qubits. Topological qubits are a more stable type of quantum bit, the basic unit of quantum computers. They store information in the way specially engineered particles called anyons are arranged and braided, not in the particles themselves, making them less prone to errors. Anyons are two-dimensional systems. They are neither fermions nor bosons, but have statistical properties in between the two. Challenges in Creating Topological Qubits Developing these qubits posed a steep learning curve, as Majorana fermions \u2014particles that are their own antiparticles\u2014had never been physically observed before. A Majorana fermion is a hypothetical particle in particle physics that is its own antiparticle, meaning it acts identically to its antiparticle. Essentially, it is a fermion that can be considered as its own mirror image, unlike other particles which have distinct antiparticles. Although theorized by Ettore Majorana over 80 years ago, evidence of a type known as Majorana zero modes (MZMs) has only emerged in the last decade. MZM is a special type of quantum state that appears at the ends of certain topological superconductors. It is characterized by being its own antiparticle, meaning it acts like both matter and antimatter simultaneously, and exists at zero energy. Due to this it becomes a promising candidate for robust quantum computation. Building a New Quantum Material: Topoconductors To fabricate these new particles, Microsoft developed topoconductors , made by combining indium arsenide (a semiconductor) and aluminum (a superconductor). Just as semiconductors enabled modern electronics, topoconductors pave the way for scalable quantum systems, potentially reaching a million qubits to solve complex industrial and societal challenges. When cooled to near absolute zero and exposed to magnetic fields, these materials merge superconductivity with semiconductors, enabling the creation of a new type of qubit. Majorana 1 Microsoft\u2019s Majorana 1 is an eight-qubit chip , which is modest compared to rivals like Google\u2019s Willow (106 qubits) and IBM\u2019s R2 Heron (156 qubits). However, its Topological Core architecture could allow scaling up to a million qubits, a necessary threshold for solving real-world problems. Majorana 1\u2019s Design Microsoft\u2019s Majorana 1 chip features aluminum nanowires arranged in an \"H\" shape. Each \"H\" structure has four controllable Majorana particles, forming a single qubit. Potential Applications of Quantum Computing Microsoft envisions Majorana 1 helping to develop breakthroughs such as: Breaking down microplastics into harmless byproducts. Inventing self-healing materials for construction, manufacturing, and healthcare. Microsoft envisions using quantum computing with generative AI to design new materials or molecules through natural language input. Quantum computing could generate synthetic data to improve AI model training. Challenges Quantum systems are highly sensitive to environmental interference, causing errors. Quantum Computers vs Supercomputers vs Classical Computers Classical Computers Classical computers process information using binary code (bits) with values of either 0 or 1. They rely on logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, NOT) to manipulate data. Quantum Computers Quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously (superposition). A qubit can have probabilities assigned to both 0 and 1, allowing it to store and process more information than a classical bit. Quantum gates (H-gate, Pauli gates) enable the processing of qubits and are reversible in nature. Supercomputers Supercomputers use advanced architectures with GPUs and multi-core processing to perform calculations faster than regular computers. Despite their power, they still follow classical computing principles and logic gates. Quantum vs. Supercomputers While supercomputers enhance classical processing speed, quantum computers can solve complex problems that classical and supercomputers cannot. Quantum gates enable unique computational abilities beyond traditional logic gates.

Recently, the Supreme Court granted interim protection from arrest to podcaster and influencer Ranveer Allahbadia in connection with the First Information Reports (FIRs) registered against him over remarks made on the YouTube show \u201cIndia Got Latent\u201d. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Introduction (Context, Background) Gag Orders (Legal Basis, Supreme Court\u2019s Speech Restrictions, Previous Judgements, Future Implications, etc.) Introduction: The Supreme Court of India has repeatedly ruled on gag orders , which prevent individuals from making public statements or publishing content. The recent case of influencer Ranveer Allahbadia , who was granted interim relief from arrest but banned from posting on social media , highlights the judicial approach toward speech restrictions . Background: The Ranveer Allahbadia Case On February 18, 2025 , the Supreme Court granted interim protection from arrest to Ranveer Allahbadia , a podcaster and influencer, over multiple FIRs related to alleged obscene and explicit content on the YouTube show India Got Latent. However, the Court imposed stringent conditions , barring Allahbadia and his associates from posting any content on social media until further orders. Additionally, he was directed to surrender his passport. This controversial restriction , effectively a gag order , contradicts prior Supreme Court rulings, which have cautioned against imposing excessive speech restrictions while granting bail or interim relief. Legal Basis for Gag Orders in India: A gag order refers to judicial or executive action that prohibits individuals from making public statements . Such orders usually fall under: Section 144 of CrPC \u2013 Allows the government to restrict public statements in cases of law and order concerns . Contempt of Court Act, 1971 \u2013 Prohibits public discussion on ongoing legal cases to prevent judicial influence. Article 19(2) of the Indian Constitution \u2013 Allows reasonable restrictions on free speech for security, public order, and morality. However, courts have consistently ruled that speech restrictions must be proportionate and justified . Supreme Court's Principles on Interim Relief and Speech Restrictions: Discretionary Conditions for Interim Relief Judges have the discretion to impose conditions when granting bail or interim relief . These conditions are typically based on: Flight risk \u2013 Whether the accused may abscond from trial . Tampering with evidence \u2013 If the accused could interfere with investigations . Intimidation of witnesses \u2013 Preventing threats or coercion. However, courts have ruled that restrictions must not violate fundamental rights . Key Supreme Court Rulings on Gag Orders: Parteek Bansal vs. State of Rajasthan (2022) The Supreme Court condemned the practice of multiple FIRs for the same offense, calling it harassment and misuse of legal machinery . Relevance: This case supports Allahbadia\u2019s argument against multiple FIRs in different states . Satender Kumar Antil vs. CBI (2022) The Supreme Court ruled that bail conditions must be reasonable , warning against imposing impossible or unjustified restrictions . Relevance: The Allahbadia order contradicts this ruling , as barring him from social media affects his profession . Frank Vitus vs. Narcotics Control Bureau (2024) The Court struck down bail conditions requiring the accused to share Google Maps location , ruling it violated privacy under Article 21 . Relevance: The Allahbadia gag order violates free speech rights under Article 19 . Rehana Fathima Case (2021) The Supreme Court stayed a Kerala High Court order restricting activist Rehana Fathima from posting content while on bail, ruling that such conditions create a chilling effect on speech . Relevance: The Allahbadia case raises similar concerns , as his gag order restricts online expression . Mohammed Zubair vs. Uttar Pradesh (2021) The Supreme Court refused to prohibit Alt News co-founder Mohammed Zubair from tweeting while on bail , stating it would be an unjustified violation of free speech . Relevance: The Allahbadia case presents identical legal challenges , as the Court restricted speech as a bail condition . Criticism of the Recent Order of the Supreme Court: Legal experts argue that the social media ban is excessive , as: The case does not involve national security or law and order threats. Speech bans violate Supreme Court precedents on bail conditions. The order indirectly affects digital content creators and free expression online. Even if Allahbadia\u2019s content is found objectionable, the IT Act and media regulations provide alternative legal measures rather than outright speech bans. Future Implications for Digital Speech in India: Need for Clear Guidelines on Gag Orders Courts must define when speech restrictions can be imposed as bail conditions, ensuring consistency in rulings.

A large delegation of European Commission College of Commissioners is in New Delhi for a two-day visit. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Introduction (Context, Statistics, etc.) India-EU Cooperation (Key Areas of Cooperation, Conclusion) Introduction: A high-level delegation of 22 out of 27 European Commissioners , led by European Commission (EC) President Ursula von der Leyen , visited New Delhi for a two-day visit. This visit, the first of its kind, underscores the deepening engagement between India and the European Union (EU) across multiple sectors, including trade, technology, green energy, and defence. The visit coincided with meetings of the India-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) , bilateral discussions between Indian ministers and EU Commissioners, and a leaders\u2019 summit, all aimed at fostering greater cooperation and investments. A Longstanding Partnership: India established diplomatic ties with the European Economic Community (EEC) \u2014the forerunner to the EU\u2014in 1962 . Over the decades, relations have expanded significantly, with key milestones including: 1993 : Signing of the Joint Political Statement. 1994 : Establishment of the Cooperation Agreement. 2000 : The first India-EU Summit in Lisbon. 2004 : Upgrading relations to a Strategic Partnership. 2020 : Adoption of the India-EU Strategic Partnership Roadmap to 2025. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and EC President Ursula von der Leyen have met multiple times, strengthening diplomatic engagements. Their discussions have spanned topics like climate action, global trade, and regional security. Key Areas of India-EU Cooperation: Trade and Investments India and the EU have been negotiating a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) for over 15 years , with discussions resuming in 2021 .

India aims to cap or reduce the consumption of urea, di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and muriate of potash (MOP) due to their heavy reliance on imports. What\u2019s in today\u2019s article? India\u2019s Dependence on Imported Fertilisers Need to Limit the Usage of Urea, MOP, and DAP An Effective Replacement for DAP: Ammonium Phosphate Sulphate (APS) The Road Ahead India\u2019s Dependence on Imported Fertilisers MOP : Fully imported from Canada, Russia, Jordan, Israel, Turkmenistan, and Belarus due to the lack of domestic potash reserves. Urea : Over 85% of demand met domestically, but production depends on imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar, the US, UAE, and Angola. DAP : imported in the form of finished fertiliser (mainly from Saudi Arabia, China, Morocco, Russia and Jordan) as well as raw material (rock phosphate from Jordan, Morocco, Togo, Egypt and Algeria; sulphur from UAE, Qatar and Oman) and intermediate chemicals (phosphoric acid from Jordan, Morocco, Senegal and Tunisia; ammonia from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and Indonesia). Need to Limit the Usage of Urea, MOP, and DAP High Import Dependence and Currency Depreciation India heavily relies on imports for MOP and DAP, while urea production depends on imported LNG. The rupee\u2019s depreciation further increases the cost of these fertilisers, putting pressure on foreign exchange reserves. Imbalance in Nutrient Application Urea (46% nitrogen), MOP (60% potash), and DAP (46% phosphorus + 18% nitrogen) are high-analysis fertilisers. Most crops do not require such high concentrations of individual nutrients, leading to inefficient nutrient absorption and wastage. Need for Balanced Fertilisation Crops require a mix of macronutrients (N, P, K), secondary nutrients (sulphur, calcium, magnesium), and micronutrients (zinc, iron, copper, boron, manganese, molybdenum). Excessive use of high-analysis fertilisers disrupts soil health and reduces long-term productivity. Efficient Use of Resources and Foreign Exchange Reducing dependence on high-analysis fertilisers ensures better utilisation of imported raw materials. Balanced fertilisation promotes sustainable farming, enhances crop yields, and reduces unnecessary expenditure on imports. An Effective Replacement for DAP: Ammonium Phosphate Sulphate (APS) APS (20:20:0:13) contains 20% nitrogen (N), 20% phosphorus (P), and 13% sulphur (S) but no potassium (K). Despite having lower phosphorus content than DAP (which has 46% P), APS is an effective alternative due to its balanced nutrient composition. APS manufacturing reduces dependence on costly phosphoric acid, making fertiliser production more economical and resource-efficient . The inclusion of sulphur improves soil health and enhances crop yield, making APS a viable and sustainable alternative to DAP . APS is ideal for oilseeds, pulses, maize, cotton, onion, and chilli , which require high sulphur content. DAP should be reserved for wheat, rice, and sugarcane, where it is most essential. Also, companies benefit by selling twice the number of APS bags from the same phosphoric acid quantity, making APS a more financially viable option. The Road Ahead Surge in NPKS Complex Fertiliser Sales NPKS fertiliser sales in 2024-25 are projected to reach 14 mt, nearly double the 7.3 mt in 2013-14. The rapid growth is largely driven by 20:20:0:13, which is steadily replacing DAP. Expanding the Push for Balanced Fertilisation Other complex fertilisers like 10:26:26:0, 12:32:16:0, 15:15:15:0, and 14:35:14:0 need stronger marketing efforts. Direct application of MOP should be minimised, with its usage integrated into balanced complex fertilisers. Reducing Dependence on High-Analysis Fertilisers The long-term goal is to limit or reduce the use of urea, DAP, and MOP, ensuring efficient nutrient application. Farmers should be encouraged to maximize nutrient use efficiency, leading to better crop productivity while conserving foreign exchange.

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court ruled that the provision in the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023, restricting the arrest of women at night is directory, not mandatory. While a single Judge deemed an 8 PM arrest a violation of Section 46(4) of the CrPC, a two-Judge Bench later held that the provision was not absolute. What\u2019s in today\u2019s article? Safeguards for Arresting Women at Night Madras High Court\u2019s Ruling on Section 46(4) of CrPC Section 46(4) of CrPC \u2013 Background Supreme Court\u2019s View on Arresting Women at Night Safeguards for Arresting Women at Night Two safeguards are provided under Section 43(5) of BNSS (which corresponds to Section 46(4) of CrPC ) for the arrest of a woman by the police. Restriction on Arrest Timing No arrest of a woman shall be made after sunset and before sunrise, except in exceptional circumstances. Magistrate\u2019s Permission Requirement In exceptional circumstances, a woman police officer must obtain prior written permission from the jurisdictional magistrate before making the arrest. Protection Against Physical Contact The arresting officer must not touch the woman unless it is a woman police officer or circumstances require it. Lack of Definition for \u2018Exceptional Circumstances\u2019 Section 46(4) of CrPC ensures the safety of women but does not explicitly define what qualifies as an exceptional situation , leading to ambiguity in its application. Madras High Court\u2019s Ruling on Section 46(4) of CrPC Non-Mandatory Nature of the Provision The Court observed that Section 46(4) of CrPC does not specify consequences for non-compliance, indicating that it is directory, not mandatory. Public Duty of Police Officers Arresting officers perform a public duty, and strict adherence to procedure should not hinder law enforcement. Practical Challenges in Heinous Cases In cases of serious crimes committed by women at night, immediate arrest may be necessary, especially if a magistrate is unavailable. Delayed action could lead to the accused escaping, which may compromise public interest. Section 46(4) of CrPC - Background 135th Law Commission Report (1989) Recommended that women should not be arrested after sunset and before sunrise. In exceptional cases, prior permission from the immediate superior officer was required. In urgent cases, an arrest report with reasons had to be submitted to the superior officer and the magistrate. 154th Law Commission Report (1996) Reaffirmed the recommendations of the 135th report regarding the arrest of women. Incorporation into CrPC (2005) Based on these recommendations, Section 46(4) was added to the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) with modifications to enhance safeguards for women. Supreme Court\u2019s View on Arresting Women at Night Earlier, the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court directed that no woman should be detained without a lady constable and never after sunset or before sunrise. The Supreme Court noted that strict adherence to this rule might cause practical difficulties in certain situations. Impact of the Madras HC Ruling Provision is Directory, Not Mandatory The Court clarified that Section 46(4) of CrPC/43(5) of BNSS is directory, meaning non-compliance does not automatically make an arrest illegal. Obligation to Justify Non-Compliance While failure to follow the provision does not invalidate an arrest, the arresting officer must provide a valid explanation for not complying with the safeguards. Need for Clear Guidelines The Court directed police authorities to issue guidelines defining what constitutes \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d to ensure the provision is not misused or ignored. newspaper.pdf ( Size: 264.2 KB ) Latest Article See All IndiGo Meltdown Dec. 5, 2025, 2:34 p.m. Economics India to Expand Its Busiest Rail Corridors: What\u2019s Planned Dec. 5, 2025, 2:08 p.m. Economics Census 2027 - Counting India, Renewing the Republic Dec. 5, 2025, 1:54 p.m. Editorial Analysis Health and National Security Cess on Demerit Goods Dec. 5, 2025, 1:48 p.m. Economics A Missing Link in India\u2019s Mineral Mission Dec. 5, 2025, 1:33 p.m. Editorial Analysis A Day to Pause and Come Down to Earth Dec. 5, 2025, 1:27 p.m. Editorial Analysis Rupee Breaches the 90-Mark Dec. 4, 2025, 1:36 p.m. Economics Putin\u2019s Visit: India\u2013Russia Ties and the Road Ahead Dec. 4, 2025, 1:24 p.m. International Relations Judiciary Flags Major Lapses in Critical Care for Acid Attack Survivors Dec. 4, 2025, 1:13 p.m. Polity & Governance India\u2019s Seven-Point Energy Transition Agenda for 2035 Dec. 4, 2025, 1:05 p.m. Editorial Analysis", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

The University Grants Commission (UGC) has decided to discontinue the UGC-CARE (Consortium for Academic and Research Ethics) list of quality academic journals, first introduced in 2018. Instead, it will provide a set of suggestive parameters for selecting journals based on eight criteria. What\u2019s in today\u2019s article? UGC-CARE Reasons for Withdrawing UGC-CARE Concerns Over Scrapping the CARE List The New Approach to Journal Evaluation UGC-CARE UGC-CARE was introduced in 2018 to combat the problem of predatory journals, journals that publish research in exchange for publishing fees without checks like peer reviews. Reason for Setting Up UGC-CARE Significance of Research Publications Publications in journals play a crucial role in institutional rankings, faculty appointments, promotions, and research grants. The quality of research publications directly impacts the credibility and funding of higher education institutions. Rise of Predatory Journals Due to the importance of journal publications, substandard and predatory journals proliferated, offering publication for a fee without rigorous peer review. This led to concerns about academic integrity and India's global research reputation. UGC\u2019s Concern and Response In 2019, the UGC highlighted the negative impact of publishing in dubious journals, warning of long-term academic damage. An investigation by a leading media house, in 2018, revealed over 300 publishers operating predatory journals in India, charging fees between $30 and $1800 for publication. Establishment of UGC-CARE Following these concerns, UGC introduced the Consortium for Academic and Research Ethics (CARE) in 2018 to replace the previous system of university-suggested journals. Under CARE, a dedicated UGC cell assessed journals based on strict quality protocols. Reasons for Withdrawing UGC-CARE Concerns with the UGC-CARE List The UGC-CARE list was introduced to ensure only reputable journals were considered for faculty selections, promotions, and research funding. However, it faced several criticisms, including: Over-centralisation in deciding journal quality. Delays in adding or removing journals. Limited inclusivity , particularly in fields like Tamil studies. Lack of transparency , leading to the exclusion of highly respected Indian-language journals. Shift to a Decentralised Approach The UGC argues that decentralisation will: Help combat predatory journals more effectively. Make institutions responsible for evaluating journals. Allow flexibility for institutions to develop their own mechanisms aligned with UGC\u2019s suggested parameters. Ensure evaluation models can adapt to evolving fields and disciplinary needs. Expert Committee Review (2023) The UGC formed an expert committee to review the CARE system. The decision to discontinue it in October 2023 was based on concerns about: Over-regulation, as highlighted by NEP 2020, which criticized excessive centralisation. Lack of transparency, with no clear reasoning for journal inclusions or exclusions. Inefficiencies, including delays in adding high-quality journals and sudden removals affecting faculty careers. Concerns from Academics Experts pointed out that CARE was not exhaustive and created pressure to publish in specific journals. Academics often receive offers to pay for publications, raising concerns about predatory practices. Concerns Over Scrapping the CARE List Potential Rise of Predatory Journals Academics fear that eliminating the CARE list removes a key safeguard against predatory journals. Without a central oversight mechanism, low-quality and exploitative journals may thrive . Lack of Public Consultation Some experts believe the system was still evolving and could have helped curb predatory publishing. An academic described the move as \u201cretrograde\u201d , arguing that there should have been public consultation before scrapping CARE. The New Approach to Journal Evaluation Suggestive Parameters for Institutions The UGC has introduced non-binding \u2018suggestive parameters\u2019 to help institutions assess journals. These parameters include evaluating the journal\u2019s editorial process, peer review system, and the expertise of its editorial board . Institutional Responsibility & Accountability Institutions are now responsible for developing their own mechanisms to evaluate journals.

Why PwDs Are Worried About Digital Personal Data Protection Rules Feb. 27, 2025 Why in the News? The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) is looking to wrap up public consultations on the draft Rules for the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 by March 5. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Introduction (Context of the Article) Controversial Provisions of DPDP Act (Section 9(1), Concerns, Govt\u2019s Response, Way Forward, etc.) Introduction: The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) is finalizing public consultations on the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023 and its draft rules. However, disability rights activists have raised serious concerns over a specific provision in Section 9(1) , which clubs adult Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) with children and mandates that their legal guardians provide consent for any digital personal data processing. Activists argue that this undermines the autonomy of PwDs and reflects a flawed understanding of guardianship laws . Understanding the Controversial Provision \u2013 Section 9(1): The DPDP Act requires data fiduciaries (organizations processing data) to obtain verifiable consent from a parent or legal guardian before processing personal data of a child or a PwD with a lawful guardian . The definition of PwDs in this provision lumps all individuals with disabilities together , assuming that those with guardians are incapable of making legally binding decisions . The draft rules under Rule 10(2) require verification that the guardian was appointed by a court or designated authority under Indian guardianship laws. While the rule provides detailed explanations for child consent , it lacks clarity on how guardianship-based consent would apply to PwDs , leading to confusion. Reasons Behind PwDs and Activists Concerns: Undermining Autonomy of PwDs The provision assumes that all PwDs with guardians lack decision-making abilities , ignoring the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPWD) Act, 2016 , which promotes supported decision-making instead of absolute guardianship . Many PwDs function independently with limited legal support but may still have a legal guardian for specific purposes. Legal Confusion Between RPWD Act and NT Act PwDs are governed by two laws: The RPWD Act, 2016 provides for limited guardianship , allowing the PwD to exercise rights with support . The National Trust (NT) Act, 1999 allows full guardianship for individuals with autism, cerebral palsy, or intellectual disabilities . However, the DPDP Act does not differentiate between these categories , applying a blanket rule for all PwDs with guardians. Practical Challenges in Implementation There is no clear guideline on how digital platforms should obtain guardian consent for PwDs . If a guardian refuses consent, the PwD may lose access to essential services , such as online banking, e-commerce, or healthcare platforms . Activists highlight gender-based discrimination , where women with disabilities may be denied access to digital platforms without guardian approval. Risk to Digital Rights of PwDs: Disability rights groups argue that the DPDP Act compromises digital rights by making guardian consent mandatory for accessing online services . This could lead to: Exclusion from digital platforms like banking, government schemes, e-commerce, and education portals . Increased control of guardians over PwDs\u2019 choices , restricting their ability to make personal decisions. Legal ambiguity for guardians , who may face penalties under the DPDP Act if their consent leads to data misuse . A survey by PACTA and Saksham Disability found that 27.4% of PwDs had legal guardians , yet most of them managed their affairs independently , contradicting the assumptions made by the DPDP Act. Government's Response and the Way Forward: The government argues that limiting the definition of PwDs covered under Section 9(1) helps address concerns. However, disability activists argue that this further complicates the issue by adding unclear definitions . Recommended changes by disability rights groups include: Amending Section 9(1) to align with the RPWD Act, 2016 , ensuring PwDs have decision-making autonomy . Providing clear guidelines on how data fiduciaries should handle guardian-based consent for PwDs . Ensuring that digital accessibility barriers are addressed , as many platforms are still not user-friendly for PwDs. Conclusion: The DPDP Act, 2023, aims to regulate digital personal data while protecting user rights. However, its rigid guardianship rules threaten the digital autonomy of PwDs , potentially excluding them from online services and decision-making processes . A balanced approach , incorporating input from disability rights groups , is necessary to ensure data protection laws do not inadvertently violate the rights of PwDs .

The Bigger Tragedy is the Railways and Its Systemic Inertia Feb. 27, 2025 Context The recent stampede at New Delhi railway station on February 15 serves as a grim reminder of the persistent inadequacies in passenger safety and crowd management within Indian Railways. Despite the rapid modernisation of railway infrastructure and an ever-expanding network, the core issue of ensuring basic safety remains alarmingly overlooked. The tragedy underscores deeper systemic failures; failures not rooted in resource constraints but in institutional inertia, mismanagement, and a lack of accountability. The Primary Cause of New Delhi Stampede: Systemic Lapses and Negligence Systematic Lapses The fundamental principle of crowd control is to ensure smooth and unidirectional movement , eliminate bottlenecks, and deploy sufficient security personnel. However, these measures were evidently ignored at New Delhi railway station. The sudden announcement of a special unreserved train to Prayagraj on platform 12, despite an existing massive crowd on platform 14, led to confusion and panic. This decision, though not officially categorised as a platform change , created an uncontrolled surge of movement, resulting in chaos and ultimately, disaster. Failure to Implement Proactive Measures Preliminary reports suggest that the control room, despite having access to CCTV surveillance, failed to take proactive measures such as stopping escalators to prevent congestion. This negligence highlights an alarming lack of situational awareness and preparedness among railway authorities. The inadequate deployment of Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel and poor barricading further exacerbated the situation, exposing passengers to grave risks. The claim that authorities were caught off-guard by the influx of ticket sales is implausible, as festival seasons have historically drawn large crowds, necessitating robust crowd management strategies. Broader Disconcerting Aspects of the Tragedy Half-Truths and Shifting Blame In the aftermath of the tragedy, Indian Railways has attempted to shift responsibility onto passengers, citing their numbers, last-minute ticket purchases, and failure to heed announcements. However, such defences fail to acknowledge that mass gatherings during religious events like the Kumbh Mela are not unprecedented. Indian Railways itself had announced the movement of over 15 lakh passengers across 350 trains to Prayagraj in February, making it evident that authorities had prior knowledge of the expected footfall. The failure to replicate effective crowd management strategies , such as those successfully implemented during Chhath Puja, further questions the Railways' preparedness. The crisis response after the tragedy , including the abrupt deployment of additional security personnel, creation of holding areas, and suspension of platform ticket sales, indicates that these measures were always within reach but were simply neglected. Had these protocols been in place beforehand, the stampede could have been prevented. Contradictory Statements and Lack of Accountability One of the most disconcerting aspects of this tragedy is the Railways\u2019 inconsistent and insensitive response. Official narratives have shifted from outright denial to ambiguous explanations, culminating in ex gratia payments to victims' families before the actual death toll was confirmed. Such actions reflect a lack of empathy and transparency, exacerbating public distrust in railway authorities. Attempt to Attribute the Stampede to Fake News Attempts to attribute the stampede to \u2018fake news\u2019 and conspiracies rather than acknowledging lapses in planning mirror a larger pattern within Indian Railways\u2014where every mishap is prematurely blamed on sabotage rather than internal failures. The Railways' history is replete with similar disasters, such as the Elphinstone Road station stampede in Mumbai (2017) and the Allahabad station stampede during the 2013 Kumbh Mela. The recurrence of such incidents suggests that lessons from past tragedies have not been internalised, raising serious concerns about institutional learning and reform. Flawed Inquiry Process The Railways' decision to conduct a \u2018high-level\u2019 inquiry through its own senior executives raises fundamental concerns about impartiality. Unlike train accidents, which are independently investigated by the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS), the current probe is being led by railway officials who may themselves be accountable for lapses. This self-regulation undermines public confidence and hinders the pursuit of justice. The Way Forward: Need for Reform A truly transparent and independent investigation , whether by the CRS or another external agency, would have signalled the Railways\u2019 commitment to accountability. However, the decision to oversee its own inquiry reinforces the perception that the institution is resistant to genuine reform.

Supreme Court Stays Lokpal Order on Corruption Complaint Against High Court Judge Feb. 28, 2025 Why in News? The Supreme Court recently stayed a Lokpal order that had taken cognizance of a corruption complaint against an unnamed High Court (HC) judge. The Lokpal bench , led by former SC judge A M Khanwilkar, asserted its authority to hear such cases under the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013 . However, the SC found this development highly concerning and halted the proceedings . The next hearing is scheduled for March 18. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Supreme Court's Rationale Behind Staying Lokpal Order Legal Provisions on Complaints Against Judges The Lokpal Case Against the HC Judge Conclusion Supreme Court's Rationale Behind Staying Lokpal Order: Judicial independence: The SC has always balanced criticism of judges with the need to safeguard judicial independence. Concerns over executive overreach: Since the Lokpal is a statutory body under the executive, allowing it to hear complaints against judges could set a precedent that threatens judicial autonomy. Precedence of established procedures: The SC noted that accepting the Lokpal's ruling could bypass established procedures for investigating complaints against judges. Legal Provisions on Complaints Against Judges: Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS): Section 77 of the IPC (1860) and Section 15 of the BNS (2023) provide that a judge cannot be charged with an offense for acts performed in the course of official duties. K Veeraswami v Union of India (1991): This landmark case ruled that judges are public servants and can be investigated for corruption under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 (replaced by the new PCA enacted in 1988) . However, criminal proceedings against a judge require Presidential sanction , based on the advice of the Chief Justice of India (CJI) . This safeguard aims to prevent frivolous or politically motivated Distinction from judicial impeachment: The procedure for filing a case against a sitting judge is different from the procedure for impeaching a judge, where approval is required from Parliament. The Lokpal Case Against the HC Judge: Allegations against the judge: Two complaints were filed against an HC judge for allegedly influencing judicial proceedings in suits involving a private company. The complainant alleged that the company was the judge\u2019s former client when he was an advocate. The Lokpal order did not address the merits of the case but focused on whether it had jurisdiction over an HC judge. Interpretation of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013: The Act applies to public servants within and outside India. Section 14 defines public servants, but does not explicitly include judges . However, sub-section (f) includes officials from autonomous bodies established by an Act of Parliament or controlled by the Central Government. Differentiation between SC and HC judges: In a separate case, the Lokpal ruled that it cannot hear cases against SC judges , as the SC was established under Article 124 of the Constitution and not an Act of Parliament. However, the Lokpal argued that HC judges fall under its jurisdiction since several High Courts were established under the High Courts Act, 1861 , and the Government of India Act, 1935 . These, according to the General Clauses Act 1897, are considered Acts of Parliament. Referral to the CJI: Despite asserting its jurisdiction, the Lokpal recognized the need for caution, given the K Veeraswami precedent . Before proceeding with an investigation, the Lokpal decided to refer the complaint to the CJI for guidance. Conclusion: The Supreme Court\u2019s intervention underscores concern over potential executive overreach and the protection of judicial independence . The case also highlights ongoing legal ambiguities regarding the jurisdiction of the Lokpal over the judiciary. The SC\u2019s final ruling will have significant implications for the accountability mechanisms of higher judiciary officials in India. newspaper.pdf ( Size: 499.4 KB ) Latest Article See All IndiGo Meltdown Dec. 5, 2025, 2:34 p.m. Economics India to Expand Its Busiest Rail Corridors: What\u2019s Planned Dec. 5, 2025, 2:08 p.m. Economics Census 2027 - Counting India, Renewing the Republic Dec. 5, 2025, 1:54 p.m. Editorial Analysis Health and National Security Cess on Demerit Goods Dec. 5, 2025, 1:48 p.m. Economics A Missing Link in India\u2019s Mineral Mission Dec. 5, 2025, 1:33 p.m. Editorial Analysis A Day to Pause and Come Down to Earth Dec. 5, 2025, 1:27 p.m. Editorial Analysis Rupee Breaches the 90-Mark Dec. 4, 2025, 1:36 p.m. Economics Putin\u2019s Visit: India\u2013Russia Ties and the Road Ahead Dec. 4, 2025, 1:24 p.m. International Relations Judiciary Flags Major Lapses in Critical Care for Acid Attack Survivors Dec. 4, 2025, 1:13 p.m. Polity & Governance India\u2019s Seven-Point Energy Transition Agenda for 2035 Dec. 4, 2025, 1:05 p.m. Editorial Analysis", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

Language Policy in India - The Three-Language Formula and Its Challenges Feb. 27, 2025 Context: Tamil Nadu's opposition to the three-language formula has caused friction with the Centre. The state has adhered to a two-language policy for decades and remains firm in its stance. The three-language policy has had a mixed record in implementation across India. The Language Debate in India: Historical perspective: Post-Independence , language policies have remained controversial. Language has been perceived as a medium of instruction rather than a cognitive tool. Colonial influence shaped the education system\u2019s focus on instruction rather than exploration. Constituent assembly and language policy: The issue of a national language was debated extensively during Constitution drafting. Hindi\u2019s adoption as an official language was fraught with complexities due to its multiple varieties. English retained prominence , despite expectations of its gradual decline. Evolution of the Three-Language Formula: The three-language formula: It is a language learning policy introduced in the 1968 National Policy on Education. It mandated that students across India learn three languages: their regional language (mother tongue), Hindi, and English. Hindi-speaking states must study a modern Indian language (preferably from the south) instead of Hindi as their third language. NEP 2020 and the three-language formula: The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has retained the three-language formula albeit with a key difference that it doesn't impose any language on any State. It specifies that the languages to be learnt will be the choice of States, regions and the students , so long as at least two of the three languages are native to India. Implementation challenges across India: In the Hindi-speaking states, the third language rarely includes contemporary languages from other Indian states. Private schools in northern states do not prioritize regional languages like Tamil or Punjabi. Political concerns over language education have remained divisive and often counterproductive. Role played by the CABE: The Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE), a remarkable forum that had served India since the 1920s, has played a crucial role in shaping language policies. CABE helped navigate federal governance challenges in education but has been inactive in recent years . The Real Issue - Language Standards in Education: Declining teaching standards: Science and mathematics have been dominated by coaching institutions, while language teaching remains neglected. English is now compulsory in many government schools, but proficiency remains low. Teachers' limited command over English affects learning outcomes, as seen in Andhra Pradesh\u2019s transition to English-medium education. Impact on regional languages and reading habits: Not just English, the standards of teaching in Hindi are no better. Hindi and other regional languages are being treated as cultural artifacts rather than active learning tools. The decline in reading habits signifies deeper issues in language education. Schools fail to cultivate habitual readers , undermining long-term language proficiency. Conclusion: The debate over language education in India remains unresolved . Tamil Nadu\u2019s steadfast opposition to the three-language formula reflects deeper concerns over linguistic identity and federal policies . Improving language teaching standards is crucial for meaningful educational reform rather than focusing solely on policy formulas.

Donald Trump offers $5-million \u2018gold card\u2019 visas for US citizenship Feb. 27, 2025 Why in news? US President Donald Trump introduced a new \"gold card\" immigration initiative, replacing the EB-5 visa program. For a $5 million investment, wealthy foreign investors can gain a path to U.S. citizenship and permanent residency. The existing EB-5 program, established in 1990, requires a minimum investment of $1.05 million (or $800,000 in distressed areas) to create or preserve jobs. It has faced criticism for fraud and misuse, including funding projects linked to Trump family businesses. What\u2019s in today\u2019s article? EB-5 Visa Program Comparison: EB-5 vs. Gold Card Potential Benefits of the Gold Card Program Concerns Surrounding the Gold Card Program Challenges Ahead for the Gold Card Program Impact of Gold Card Program on Indian Investors EB-5 Visa Program Established by the U.S. Congress in 1990, the EB-5 visa program aimed to boost the American economy through job creation and capital investment by foreign investors. Investment Requirements The program grants green cards to immigrants who invest at least $1,050,000 or $800,000 in economically distressed areas, known as targeted employment areas. Capping The EB-5 program was capped at 10,000 visas annually with 3,000 reserved for investments in high-unemployment areas. Criticism and Controversies The program faced criticism for deviating from its intended purpose, with reports indicating that businesses and Trump family members used it to fund major property developments. Calls for reform grew during Trump\u2019s presidency. Renewal and Legal Challenges The program was last renewed under President Joe Biden in 2022, with investment thresholds raised. The Trump administration attempted to increase the minimum investment for targeted areas to $900,000 in 2019, but a federal judge overturned this decision in 2021. Comparison: EB-5 vs. Gold Card EB-5 Program Established in 1990 and managed by USCIS. Grants Green Cards to foreign investors who invest at least $1.05 million ($800,000 in certain cases). Requires the creation of at least 10 jobs for Americans. Gold Card Program Likely does not require investment in American businesses or job creation. Allows direct purchase of a Green Card for $5 million. Administration and Processing United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is expected to regulate and issue Gold Cards. Likely involvement of the Department of State and Department of Commerce. Faster processing times anticipated to encourage participation. Potential Benefits of the Gold Card Program Attracting Wealthy Investors The straightforward residency pathway may encourage high-net-worth individuals to move to the U.S. These investors could contribute to the economy through real estate, luxury markets, and business investments. Reducing Fraud Risks The EB-5 program has faced allegations of fraud. A direct, high-cost purchase model may help minimize misuse and regulatory loopholes. Concerns Surrounding the Gold Card Program Citizenship for Sale The program prioritizes wealth over merit, potentially disadvantaging skilled professionals. It raises ethical and political concerns about fairness in immigration policy. Risk of Financial Misuse Investment-based immigration programs can be exploited for money laundering and foreign influence. Lack of strong regulatory oversight may increase these risks. No Economic Contribution Requirement Unlike EB-5, the Gold Card does not mandate job creation or business investment. Passive investors could gain residency without contributing to the U.S. economy. Historical Precedents and Policy Questions A similar program in Canada was discontinued due to widespread misuse. Key concerns remain: Should U.S. citizenship be available for purchase? Should immigration policy prioritize skills and economic contributions? Challenges Ahead for the Gold Card Program Legislative Hurdles in Congress Immigration policy changes require congressional approval. While Republicans hold a majority, not all may support a program perceived as \"selling\" citizenship. Democrats are expected to oppose the proposal. Potential Legal Challenges Most visa-related legal issues arise from program administration rather than the policy itself. It is uncertain what legal challenges the Gold Card may face. Impact of Gold Card Program on Indian Investors In 2023, only 631 Indians obtained Green Cards through the EB-5 program. Given the $5 million (\u20b943 crore) price tag, the Gold Card may not be attractive to many Indian investors. Impact on applicants from other categories Over a million Indians are among those waiting for green cards in the U.S., according to US government data. In employment-based categories, the backlog for Indian applicants is projected to reach 2.19 million by 2030. Any new category will add to their waiting period.

India\u2019s textile industry is one of the largest globally, covering the entire value chain from cotton cultivation to apparel manufacturing. However, it lags behind China, Vietnam, and Bangladesh in exports due to fragmented supply chains, higher costs, and complex regulations. Despite being a major producer of cotton and synthetic fibres, the industry has seen slow growth. Rising sustainability and compliance requirements are expected to further increase costs, particularly for smaller firms. What\u2019s in today\u2019s article? India\u2019s Textile Journey: From Fibre to Fabric India\u2019s Textile and Apparel Industry: Growth and Export Trends India\u2019s Textile Export Challenges The Sustainability Challenge in India\u2019s Textile Industry India\u2019s Textile Journey: From Fibre to Fabric Cotton Production and Employment India is the second-largest cotton producer globally, contributing 24% of global production. Cotton farming involves around 60 lakh farmers, primarily in Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Telangana. The cotton textile value chain, from fibre processing to garment manufacturing, employs over 4.5 crore people. Man-Made Fibre (MMF) Industry India is also the second-largest producer of MMF , with Reliance Industries leading in polyester and Grasim Industries being the sole domestic producer of viscose. However, MMF consumption in India remains low at 3.1 kg per capita, compared to 12 kg in China and 22.5 kg in North America. Overall fibre consumption, including natural and synthetic fibres, is 5.5 kg per capita, below the global average of 11.2 kg.

However, manufacturing growth has slowed over the past decade. Growth trends Between FY15 and FY19, the textile sector grew at a CAGR of 0.4%, while apparel grew at 7.7% . From FY20 to FY24, the industry contracted, with textiles shrinking by 1.8% annually and apparel by 8.2% , largely due to post-pandemic economic challenges. Export Performance and Key Markets Despite a trade surplus, textile and apparel exports have seen sluggish growth. In FY24, exports stood at $34.1 billion, slightly up from $33.4 billion in FY20. Nearly 50% of exports were to the U.S. and EU, serving brands like JCPenney, Gap, and Decathlon. Sector-Wise Export Trends Garment and Apparel Exports \u2013 Declined from $15.5 billion in FY20 to $14.5 billion in FY24. Cotton Textiles and Home Textiles \u2013 Grew from $10.2 billion in FY20 to $12.3 billion in FY24, with key players like Welspun Living and Trident Ltd. Challenges for MSMEs The slowdown has hit MSME clusters, especially in Tamil Nadu, due to global and domestic economic headwinds, impacting production and exports. India\u2019s Textile Export Challenges Lagging Behind Competitors India trails China, Vietnam, and Bangladesh in textile exports due to higher production costs and a fragmented supply chain. In contrast, Vietnam exported $40 billion worth of apparel in 2023, benefiting from vertically integrated supply chains that lower manufacturing costs. Fragmented Cotton Supply Chain India's cotton supply chain is spread across multiple states, increasing logistical costs and hindering large-scale production. The lack of localisation makes production costlier compared to fibre-to-fashion firms in China and Vietnam, which offer low-cost, high-quality, and adaptable exports. Regulatory and Trade Barriers Competitor nations benefit from free trade agreements (FTAs) and simpler customs procedures , reducing regulatory costs. In contrast, India\u2019s complex export procedures, requiring detailed accounting of every fabric, button, and zipper, increase compliance burdens for exporters. High Raw Material Costs in MMF Sector India\u2019s man-made fibre (MMF) sector suffers from high raw material costs. Quality control orders (QCOs) restrict imports of polyester and viscose fibres, forcing domestic yarn makers to rely on costlier local alternatives. The Sustainability Challenge in India\u2019s Textile Industry Growing Global Focus on Sustainability With global markets tightening compliance norms, Indian manufacturers must increase renewable energy use, improve recycling, and ensure stricter sourcing and traceability. Rising Costs Due to Sustainable Sourcing A global shift towards sustainable textiles is increasing production costs. The EU, which accounts for 20% of India\u2019s textile exports, has implemented 16 new regulations from 2021 to 2024, making it challenging for small", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

Reducing Employer Compliance Burden - A Roadmap for State Governments Feb. 25, 2025 Context: State governments impose a significant compliance burden on employers, accounting for 80% of criminal provisions, 65% of filings, and 63% of total compliances. Chief Ministers (CMs) can improve the business environment through three key reforms: Decriminalisation, Digitisation, and Rationalisation. These reforms can help boost high-wage employment and foster economic growth . Decriminalisation of Employer Compliance: The current scenario: India has 26,134 employer-related jail provisions, of which 80% can be removed by state governments. The Jan Vishwas Bill eliminated only 110 out of 5,239 central employer jail provisions due to bureaucratic inertia and vested interests. Recommended approach: CMs should adopt a \u201c reversing the gaze \u201d approach, removing criminal provisions except in cases involving: Physical harm to individuals. Intentional fraud against stakeholders. Major societal externalities affecting public order, national integrity, or property rights. Vague general clauses that do not specify crimes clearly. Procedural infractions like delays or inaccuracies in filings, incorrect formats, and calculation errors. The upcoming Jan Vishwas 2.0 could eliminate another 40% of employer-related criminal provisions. States like Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu have made small reforms, while Gujarat, Karnataka, and Odisha are considering changes. Digitisation for Simplified Compliance: The need for digital transformation: 65% of India\u2019s 69,233 employer compliances can be made paperless, presence-less, and cashless. India\u2019s Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) has already transformed areas like vaccine certification, toll payments, de-duplicated welfare records, and payments. For example , RBI\u2019s initial UPI target of a billion monthly transactions has now been revised to a billion daily transactions. Recent announcements on PAN 2.0 and the Entity Locker (a single source of truth, tamper-proof, and authenticated document repository for all government-issued licenses, registrations, and permissions). Proposed solutions: State Employer Compliance Grids ( SECGs ) should be implemented, replicating DPI\u2019s open-architecture technology for: Filing periodic returns. Issuing licences, registrations, and NOCs. Ensuring a single-source, tamper-proof repository for compliance documents. SECGs can be operational in 180 days and should integrate with national initiatives. Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Andhra Pradesh are in the early stages of adopting SECGs. Rationalisation of Governance and Compliance Frameworks: Challenges in bureaucratic structures: India\u2019s state civil service has become rigid and inefficient , often prioritizing prohibition over permission and guilt over innocence. Excessive bureaucracy: Number of government departments in some states: UP (72), Uttarakhand (63), Assam (54), Punjab (51), MP (47), Maharashtra (35), Andhra Pradesh (31), Gujarat (27). Comparatively, developed nations operate with fewer ministries: Japan (15), UK (22), US (25). Way forward: Simplifying governance structures: By consolidating departments can enhance efficiency. Decentralisation of policy-making: PM Modi\u2019s idea that 29 CMs matter more than one PM aligns with philosopher Karl Polanyi\u2019s view that markets are shaped by social, political, and economic factors. Conclusion: India\u2019s economic challenge lies in \u201c employed poverty \u201d, with too many people in low-productivity jobs . CMs can accelerate reforms by removing unnecessary compliance hurdles, enabling businesses to flourish and generate higher wages. As Daniel Kahneman (Nobel Prize-winning economist) suggests, sometimes the best way to accelerate progress is not by stepping on the accelerator but by removing the brakes - a principle CMs should embrace for economic transformation.

Indian Industry Needs Innovation, Not Mindless Toil Feb. 24, 2025 Context The recent debate surrounding corporate leaders urging Indians to work longer hours sheds light on the structural issues in India's labour market. While these appeals might stem from a desire for economic growth, they fail to acknowledge the harsh realities of India\u2019s predominantly informal workforce. The over-reliance on cheap labour, rather than technological advancement, continues to hinder India's long-term industrial progress. Amid these debates, it is important to examine the implications of this labour-dependent strategy, highlighting its impact on productivity , innovation, and economic sustainability. The Informality of India's Workforce India\u2019s workforce is overwhelmingly informal, with only 21.7% of workers in salaried jobs , according to the 2023-24 Periodic Labour Force Survey. Even among these salaried workers, nearly half lack formal contracts, paid leave, or social security. The call for longer working hours disregards the reality that most Indian workers , particularly manual labourers and household helpers, already endure gruelling schedules simply to survive. Unlike developed nations where productivity gains have reduced working hours, India continues to extract economic value by extending the workday rather than improving efficiency. Striking Aspects of India\u2019s Industrial Structure Cheap Labour as a Competitive Strategy One of the most striking aspects of India\u2019s industrial structure is its heavy reliance on cheap labour as the primary source of competitive advantage. Instead of investing in technological innovation, automation, or efficient management practices, Indian businesses continue to extract economic gains by keeping wages low and increasing working hours. This approach, while beneficial for short-term profits , ultimately hinders long-term economic growth and industrial competitiveness. A Historical Perspective: The Evolution of Labour Exploitation Throughout history, economies have used labour-intensive methods to drive industrial growth, particularly in their early stages. During the Industrial Revolution in Britain, factories exploited workers by enforcing excessively long hours under inhumane conditions. Karl Marx famously described how capitalists had a \u2018werewolf hunger for surplus labour ,\u2019 pushing workers beyond their physical limits in pursuit of higher profits. However, by the mid-19th century, labour reforms, unionisation, and technological progress led to a shift from sheer labour exploitation to efficiency-driven productivity. The Structural Shift Toward Informality Indian businesses have systematically shifted away from the organised sector , where labour laws ensure minimum wages, job security, and worker benefits, to the unorganised sector, where such regulations are largely absent. This structural transformation has allowed industries to sidestep labour protections and exploit workers without facing legal repercussions. One of the key strategies used to maintain low labour costs is the proliferation of small, unregistered firms. Industrial hubs such as Coimbatore and Ludhiana are filled with micro-enterprises , often operating in small sheds, producing components that feed into larger manufacturing networks. These businesses lack formal employer-employee relationships , with many owners being former workers themselves. In such environments, wages remain depressed, and technological investment is minimal. The Rise of Contract Labour and Migrant Workforces Another major factor in the persistence of the cheap-labour model is the increasing use of contract workers. Over half (56%) of all workers who joined India\u2019s factory sector after 2011-12 were employed on a contract basis rather than as permanent employees. Contract workers receive significantly lower wages and are excluded from essential benefits such as job security, health insurance, and pension schemes. Moreover, India's industry relies heavily on migrant workers who leave their villages in search of employment in urban and industrial centres. These workers often belong to disadvantaged social groups , lack access to land or assets, and have no bargaining power in the labour market. As a result, they are forced to accept extremely low wages and poor working conditions. Why Cheap Labour Fails as a Long-Term Strategy Low Productivity and Stagnation Unlike developed economies, where productivity growth drives economic expansion, India\u2019s reliance on cheap labour has stifled innovation. Businesses remain reluctant to invest in technology or skill development, leading to a workforce that is overworked but underproductive. Weak Domestic Demand Suppressing wages weakens the purchasing power of the working class, limiting the growth of the domestic market. When a large segment of the population earns barely enough to survive, demand for consumer goods, services, and housing remains low, slowing ", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

ASER (Rural) 2024 - A Story of Recovery and Progress in Foundational Learning Jan. 29, 2025 Context: The Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2024 is a nationwide rural household survey (facilitated by NGO Pratham) to assess children\u2019s schooling status and their basic reading and arithmetic skills. Key findings of the ASER 2024 survey are presented separately for three groups of children: Pre-primary (age group 3-5), elementary (age group 6-14), and older children (age group 15-16). The findings highlight a strong recovery from pandemic-induced learning losses and point towards the effectiveness of recent educational reforms. Key Findings from ASER 2024: Enrollment trends: The overall school enrollment rate among 6-14-year-olds stood at 98.1% in 2024, close to 98.4% in 2022. Pre-school enrollment among 3-5-year-olds increased, with a sharp rise among 5-year-olds from 58.5% in 2018 to 71.4% in 2024. Recovery in reading skills: The proportion of Class III students able to read at a Class II level has fully recovered from the pandemic setback, reaching 27.1% in 2024 (up from 20.5% in 2022). For Class V students, the percentage of children who can read Class II level text has risen to 48.7% in 2024, compared to 42.8% in 2022, approaching the 50.4% level of 2018. Progress in arithmetic skills: The percentage of Class III students able to do basic subtraction rose to 33.7% in 2024, the highest in a decade. The proportion of Class V students who can perform division increased to 30.7% in 2024, surpassing pre-pandemic levels of 27.8% in 2018. Digital literacy insights: ASER 2024 included a section on digital literacy for the first time, focusing on smartphone access, ownership , and basic digital skills among 14-16-year-olds. More boys (85.5%) than girls (79.4%) reported knowing how to use a smartphone. Performance of Government Schools: Improvements in enrollment trends: Government school enrollment, which increased during the pandemic, has nearly returned to pre-pandemic levels - 66.8% in 2024, compared to 65.6% in 2018 and 72.9% in 2022. Improvements in learning outcome: In arithmetic , government schools witnessed a 36.6% improvement in subtraction skills in Class III, compared to a 10.2% rise in private schools. The number of Class III children in government schools who can read a Class II textbook stands at 23.4%, up from 16.3% in 2022 and 20.9% in 2018. Factors behind the improvement: The National Education Policy ( NEP ) 2020\u2019s focus on foundational literacy and numeracy (FLN) appears to have played a crucial role. The Union Education Ministry\u2019s Nipun Bharat Mission has been a key driver of learning initiatives in primary education. State-wise Progress: Remarkable recovery in low-performing States: States like UP, Bihar, MP, and Tamil Nadu have shown significant learning gains. In UP , the proportion of Class III government school students reading at Class II level rose from 12.3% in 2018 to 27.9% in 2024. Bihar saw an increase in Class III reading levels from 12.1% in 2018 to 20.1% in 2024 and arithmetic levels from 18% to 28.2%. Improvement in high-performing States: States like Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Haryana, and Odisha showed a 10-percentage point increase in reading levels from 2022 to 2024. Uttarakhand recorded a sharp rise in Class III reading levels from 24.7% in 2018 to 35.6% in 2024. Conclusion: ASER 2024 highlights not just recovery but a transformative shift in India's approach to foundational learning. The NEP 2020 has provided a common goal for all states, allowing them to adopt unique strategies for FLN improvement. The data underscores a nationwide effort to ensure foundational literacy and numeracy among primary school children, marking a historic milestone in India\u2019s education system.

The Copyright Conundrum in Carnatic Music Jan. 30, 2025 Context Carnatic music, an ancient and revered form of Indian classical music, has long existed outside the strict boundaries of copyright law. This exclusion is due to both historical factors and the unique nature of Carnatic music , which emphasises improvisation and oral tradition. However, as the recent Margazhi music season in Chennai demonstrated, copyright concerns are becoming increasingly relevant. The existing legal framework does not adequately protect performers , raising pressing questions about whether the law should evolve to reflect the realities of Indian classical music. The Legal Dilemma: Copyright and Carnatic Music A Unique Dilemma The relationship between copyright law and Carnatic music presents a unique dilemma that stems from the nature of classical compositions, the role of improvisation, and the historical context of Indian copyright legislation. Unlike Western classical music, which relies heavily on written scores, Carnatic music is primarily an oral tradition, passed down from teacher to student over generations. This fundamental difference raises complex legal questions about how intellectual property rights should apply to an art form that thrives on fluidity and creative reinterpretation. The Western Influence on Indian Copyright Law Copyright law in India, originally enacted in 1914 during British rule, was influenced by Western legal frameworks, particularly British copyright law. The legislation, which was revised in 1957, continued to operate under the assumption that music is a composition that can be reduced to written notation. This perspective is aligned with the Western classical tradition , where composers write detailed scores specifying every note, dynamic, and articulation. The role of a performer in Western classical music is often to faithfully interpret these compositions rather than to improvise or innovate. The Challenges of Implementation of Copyright Law in Carnatic Music Carnatic music, by contrast, does not function in the same way , while written notation exists, it serves only as a skeletal framework for a composition. The essence of Carnatic music lies in its improvisatory aspects , manodharma sangeetam, which includes raga alapana (melodic improvisation), neraval (improvised elaboration of a phrase), and kalpana swaras (spontaneous note sequences). Because these elements are not fixed in writing , they do not fit neatly into the legal definition of a \u2018musical work\u2019 under copyright law. This raises the fundamental question: Should copyright law define music based on a Western understanding, or should it evolve to accommodate non-Western traditions like Carnatic music? The Public Domain and the Question of Improvisation One of the major reasons Carnatic music has remained outside mainstream copyright discussions is that most of its foundational compositions belong to the public domain. The works of composers such as Tyagaraja, Purandara Dasa, and Gopalakrishna Bharati were created before copyright laws existed, meaning their compositions are freely available for anyone to perform. However, Carnatic musicians do not merely reproduce these compositions\u2014they reinterpret them, often introducing complex improvisations and personal stylistic touches. These additions, while artistically significant, do not currently receive copyright protection . This leads to several critical legal questions: If a musician improvises a section of a song, does that improvisation qualify as a new, copyrightable work? If a performer reinterprets a composition by changing its raga or tempo, should they have rights over that specific rendition? Should a performer\u2019s unique style , such as Madurai Mani Iyer\u2019s distinctive approach to Eppo Varuvaro, be considered an intellectual property right? Existing Copyright Protections and Their Limitations Composer and Lyricist Rights The composer and lyricist of a song receive copyright protection for their lifetime plus 60 years. This ensures that their work cannot be commercially exploited without permission. However, in the case of Carnatic music, most compositions by great composers like Tyagaraja, Muddusvami Dikshitar, and Shyama Shastri are already in the public domain, meaning anyone can perform or record them without seeking permission. Mechanical Rights (Rights Over Sound Recordings) When a song is recorded onto a tangible medium, such as an audio CD or a digital file, the entity that records the song (such as a record label or an individual artist) gains mechanical rights over that specific recording for 60 years. While this provides some form of protection, it does not extend to live performances where improvisation plays a significant role. Performers' Rights Performers, including singers and instrumentalists , have the right to prevent unauthorised recordings of their performances. This is particularly relevant for live conc", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

Mahakumbh Stampede: Understanding the Causes and Strategies for Prevention Jan. 31, 2025 Why in news? A stampede at the Mahakumbh Mela in Allahabad on January 29 claimed several lives. UP CM attributed the tragedy to the overwhelming crowd gathering for Mauni Amavasya. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) had in 2014 published a report on crowd management at big events and prevention of stampedes. The report said, \u201c Majority of the crowd disasters in India and developing countries have occurred at religious places .\u201d What\u2019s in today\u2019s article? Causes of Stampedes Role of Crowd Behaviour in Stampedes Past Stampede Incidents Proactive Planning for Crowd Control Importance of Infrastructure and Information in Crowd Control Causes of Stampedes Stampedes can result from multiple factors, including structural weaknesses (poor barricading, weak guardrails, narrow exits, inadequate lighting), fire or electrical failures, poor crowd control, and lack of coordination among stakeholders. Failures in Crowd Control The NDMA report highlights key reasons for crowd control failures, such as: Underestimation of expected crowd size Exceeding venue capacity Limited holding areas before entry Locked or closed exits Weak railings and lack of queue management Absence of sectoral partitions to regulate movement Consequences of Poor Management Inadequate arrangements often trigger panic or excitement, leading to overcrowding or rapid movement. This, in turn, results in crushing, suffocation, and trampling. The report identifies compressive asphyxia as the leading cause of fatalities in such disasters. Role of Crowd Behaviour in Stampedes Understanding crowd behaviour is crucial for preventing stampedes. The actions of a few individuals can influence many, sometimes leading to panic or disorder. A community-based approach to crowd control is more effective than force-based methods. Impact of Overcrowding At many events, demand exceeds available space, leading to overcrowding. To manage this, input control \u2014such as restricting entry through a mandatory registration process\u2014can help regulate the crowd. Risks of Poor Crowd Management Long wait times may prompt individuals to climb fences, causing others to follow and leading to congestion in another area. Additionally, poorly executed control measures, such as police chasing unruly groups toward an incoming crowd, can create dangerous collisions, worsening the situation. Past Stampede Incidents The NDMA report references several past stampedes, including: Nashik Kumbh (August 2003): 29 pilgrims died due to overcrowding at barricades, sudden reverse crowd flow, sadhus moving in procession with pilgrims, and unforeseen influx of pilgrims at various points. Kalubai Yatra Mandhardevi (January 2005): 293 people were killed due to wrong crowd estimates, inadequate temple space, narrow, slippery paths with illegal vendors, lack of safety measures, and poor infrastructure. Causes Identified in Investigations Nashik Kumbh: The stampede was triggered by crowd pressure at barricades and the unplanned movement of pilgrims and sadhus. Kalubai Yatra: Causes included inaccurate crowd estimates, narrow paths, illegal activities, lack of safety and medical facilities, and poor coordination between stakeholders. Proactive Planning for Crowd Control The NDMA report stresses that most stampedes can be avoided with proactive planning and effective execution. It outlines a holistic approach that includes: Controlling the crowd inflow Regulating the crowd within the venue Managing the crowd outflow Understanding Demand and Supply To manage demand, authorities must analyze: Historical crowd data Arrival patterns and peak times (e.g., festivals, holidays) Advance registration and ticketing systems Public transport schedules For supply management, the venue's capacity must be calculated to avoid overcrowding. Role of Online Registration Examples from Vaishnodevi and Sabarimala show that online registration can help manage crowd arrivals and influence patterns. Dealing with Limited Supply Capacity In places where increasing supply is not feasible due to religious beliefs or geography, authorities should focus on making waiting times more comfortable for visitors. Importance of Infrastructure and Information in Crowd Control The report highlights the need for adequate infrastructure for crowd management at religious sites. It recommends setting up staging points for visitors, equipped with necessary facilities like rest areas, food, water, and hygiene. These points should be monitored effectively. The report also emphasizes the role of information management and the need for effective dissemination of information to guide visitors and maintain order.

The Science is Clear, Crowd Disasters Are Preventable Jan. 31, 2025 Context The recent disaster at the Maha Kumbh in India, which claimed 30 lives, is another reminder of the dangers posed by high-density crowds. Despite scientific research offering clear solutions, local governments and event organisers often fail to take the necessary precautions. Therefore, it is important to explore the causes of crowd crushes, examines their global impact, stricter regulations and better crowd management strategies to prevent future tragedies. The Science Behind Crowd Crushes and Similar Past Incidents The Science Behind Crowd Crushes Crowd crushes occur when too many people are compressed into a confined space , increasing the density beyond safe limits. Research shows that injuries begin occurring at a density of five people per square meter , while a density of seven people per square meter or more can lead to severe injuries or fatalities. This is because, at such high densities, individuals lose the ability to control their movements , and breathing itself can become difficult. The recent Maha Kumbh disaster is a textbook example of how crowd density can spiral out of control. Reports suggest that a large crowd formed behind a barrier, leading to intense pressure on those at the front. When movement is restricted, even minor disturbances, such as pushing or sudden shifts in direction, can trigger a deadly crush. Similar Incidents Similar incidents have occurred worldwide, including the 2021 Astroworld concert in Houston, the 2022 Itaewon Halloween tragedy in South Korea, the 2023 Yemen charity distribution stampede, and the 2024 religious festival disaster in Nigeria. These examples highlight the widespread nature of the problem and emphasize the need for proactive crowd management strategies. Misconceptions Surrounding Crowd Crush Incidents and Economic Incentives Behind the Inaction The Myth of Crowd Behaviour as the Cause Historically, people have believed that crowd crushes are caused by panic, with individuals recklessly pushing and trampling others in an attempt to escape. However, scientific studies on crowd dynamics have consistently debunked this notion. In reality, crowd crushes occur due to extreme density , not panic or aggression. When too many people are forced into a small space, physical movement becomes restricted, and individuals lose their ability to control their own actions. At this point, even minor pressure from behind\u2014whether intentional or not\u2014can cause people at the front to be squeezed against barriers , walls, or other individuals, leading to asphyxiation and fatal injuries. Furthermore, once a crowd reaches a critical density, people inside the mass are unable to see or understand what is happening around them. Even if they sense danger, they may have no way to escape or influence the movement of the crowd. This is why crowd crushes often occur even in calm settings , such as religious pilgrimages, where there is no aggressive or reckless behaviour. The Economic Incentives Behind Inaction Despite the clear benefits of proper crowd management, many event organisers fail to implement these strategies. A major reason for this is financial incentive . Large-scale events , whether concerts, religious gatherings, or sports matches, generate significant revenue through ticket sales, concessions, and merchandise. Organisers often have a vested interest in packing as many people as possible into a venue to maximize profits. Implementing safety measures , such as limiting attendance, expanding venue space, or hiring trained crowd managers, is often seen as an unnecessary expense. Governments also share some of the blame. In many countries, there are no strict regulations requiring event organisers to follow best practices for crowd safety . As a result, safety measures are often left to the discretion of private promoters , who may prioritise cost-cutting over public safety. Without legal mandates and strict enforcement, profit-driven decision-making can put thousands of lives at risk. Key Actions to Prevent Dangerous Crowd Densities Venue Design and Capacity Management Ensuring that event spaces are designed to accommodate the expected number of attendees without creating choke points, bottlenecks, or dead ends. Calculating crowd capacity based on scientifically proven density limits is essential. Sufficient Entry and Exit Points Having enough well-spaced entry and exit routes prevents dangerous congestion. Restricted or blocked exits have been a major factor in past crowd disasters, trapping people in deadly situations. Staggered Arrivals and Departures Large crowds do not necessarily have to move all at once. Organisers can schedule staggered entry and exit times , reducing the likelihood of mass surges at any given moment.

India\u2019s Vision for a \u2018Viksit Bharat\u2019 and the Role of Diplomacy India's vision of achieving a \u2018Viksit Bharat\u2019 (developed India) by 2047 is closely tied to developing and maintaining strong global partnerships. The government has articulated its ambition to emerge as a leader on the world stage , particularly in engaging with the Global South and strengthening ties with key regional actors like the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Additionally, India has sought to enhance regional connectivity and play a more active role in multilateral groups such as the Quad (comprising India, Australia, Japan, and the United States). India\u2019s creation of institutions like the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure are also central to its growing global influence. However, these aspirations necessitate a well-funded and well-equipped Ministry of External Affairs. Shortcomings of MEA Budget Inadequate Funding for Expanding Diplomatic Initiatives India\u2019s foreign policy ambitions are broad, encompassing regional, bilateral, and multilateral engagements. However, the financial resources allocated to the MEA are insufficient to match the scale of India\u2019s diplomatic outreach. Despite a 23% increase in the MEA\u2019s budget in 2024-25, this bump still falls short of what is needed to effectively execute the country\u2019s ambitious foreign policy goals. Given the complex and dynamic nature of global diplomacy, the MEA is tasked with managing a broad range of activities, including international negotiations, participation in multilateral organisations, and fostering strategic partnerships with key global powers. The current budget allocation simply does not provide the Ministry with enough financial flexibility to pursue these goals comprehensively. Understaffing and Overstretching of Resources One of the most significant shortcomings of the MEA\u2019s budget is its chronic understaffing. The Indian Foreign Service (IFS) , the backbone of India\u2019s diplomatic corps, remains significantly understaffed. Despite the vital role played by the IFS in shaping foreign policy and managing international relations, the Ministry has faced delays in expanding the diplomatic corps and lacks sufficient lateral entry mechanisms to bring in fresh expertise from outside the traditional diplomatic training. The IFS's overburdened diplomats often find themselves stretched thin , leading to issues with the quality and timeliness of India\u2019s diplomatic efforts. Limited Capacity for Regional Integration and Economic Diplomacy Another area in which the MEA\u2019s budget falls short is the financing of India\u2019s economic diplomacy and regional integration efforts. India\u2019s regional connectivity initiatives, such as the \u2018Neighbourhood First\u2019 policy, are critical to maintaining stability and creating cooperation in South Asia. However, these initiatives often require substantial financial backing to be effective. As India faces growing competition from China, which has significantly ramped up its investment in South Asia, India needs to counterbalance this influence with stronger diplomatic, economic, and infrastructural support. Lack of Funding for Cultural Diplomacy and Soft Power Projection India has made significant strides in using cultural diplomacy as a means of strengthening its global influence. Initiatives such as the promotion of yoga, Indian art, and academic exchanges are key components of India\u2019s \u2018soft power.\u2019 However, the MEA\u2019s budget for cultural diplomacy and foreign missions has been relatively modest, with a mere 7% increase in the recent Budget. Cultural diplomacy requires sustained investment to expand the reach and effectiveness of India\u2019s soft power initiatives. Without adequate funding, India risks losing out on the opportunity to strengthen its global image and cultural footprint. Regional Connectivity Challenges and the Need for Financial Backing India\u2019s regional connectivity is facing numerous challenges, particularly in South Asia. The political upheaval in Bangladesh, Myanmar\u2019s instability, strained relations with Nepal, and the Maldives\u2019 India Out\u2019 campaign have all added layers of complexity to India\u2019s foreign policy. However, recent high-level visits, including those by Sri Lanka\u2019s President and Bhu", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

Bridge the Milk Divide for a Nutritionally Secure India Jan. 30, 2025 Context India\u2019s dairy sector has long been celebrated for its remarkable supply-side achievements , with the White Revolution transforming the country into the world\u2019s largest milk producer. However, while production has surged, an equally pressing issue remains unaddressed\u2014the stark disparities in milk consumption across socio-economic groups, regions, and social categories. As the Union Budget 2025-26 approaches, policymakers must shift their focus toward equitable distribution to ensure that milk reaches the most vulnerable populations. The Nutritional Importance of Milk Milk is an essential source of protein, calcium, and micronutrients , playing a crucial role in supplementing predominantly plant-based Indian diets. Research indicates t hat milk consumption is linked to improved child growth outcomes, reducing the risks of stunting, underweight, and other anthropometric failures among children aged six months to five years. Despite these benefits, access to milk remains highly inequitable, with significant disparities based on income, geography, and social background. The Extent of Inequality in Milk Consumption and the Challenges in Ensuring Equitable Access Income-Based Disparities According to the latest Household Consumer Expenditure Surveys (HCES) conducted by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) , households in the top income decile (the richest 10%) consume three to four times more milk per capita than those in the lowest-income decile (the poorest 10%). While consumption has increased among lower-income groups, this growth has not been sufficient to bridge the gap. The poorest 30% of Indian households account for only 18% of total milk consumption , despite making up a much larger share of the population. Wealthier households not only consume more milk but also have access to value-added dairy products like cheese, flavoured milk, and packaged dairy sweets. For low-income households, the high cost of milk forces them to prioritise more affordable calorie-dense foods , often leading to poor nutrition. Although India has a robust dairy industry, the affordability gap means that even though milk is widely produced, it does not necessarily reach those who need it most. Urban-Rural Divide India\u2019s milk production is largely concentrated in rural areas , yet paradoxically, urban households consume about 30% more milk per capita than rural households . Higher purchasing power in urban areas allows for greater consumption of milk and dairy products. The presence of organised retail chains and supermarkets in cities provides easier access to processed and packaged milk. Urban diets are more diverse, and milk is often included in multiple forms, such as coffee, tea, milkshakes, and yogurt-based products. In contrast, rural populations\u2014despite producing most of India\u2019s milk\u2014consume less due to lower incomes, traditional dietary habits, and limited access to refrigeration . Regional Disparities Milk consumption varies drastically across different states, reflecting regional differences in dietary preferences, economic conditions, and dairy industry development. Northern and Western states (Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Gujarat) consume 333 to 421 grams of milk per capita daily at home. These regions have a strong dairy culture, with milk being a staple in their diets. Eastern states (Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and West Bengal) consume only 75 to 171 grams per capita daily , much lower than the recommended levels. Dairy consumption is lower in these states due to factors such as dietary traditions, economic constraints, and weaker dairy supply chains. States with strong dairy cooperative movements, such as Gujarat (home to Amul), have higher per capita milk consumption , whereas states with weaker dairy infrastructures struggle with accessibility and affordability. Social and Cultural Disparities Scheduled Tribe (ST) households consume four litres less milk per capita per month than General Category households. Many ST communities belong to lower-income groups, making milk a luxury rather than a dietary staple. Certain communities historically rely more on plant-based diets , with milk playing a lesser role in their nutrition. Many ST populations live in remote areas with poor market infrastructure, making regular milk consumption challenging. Out-of-Home Consumption and Underreporting The NSSO Household Consumer Expenditure Surveys mainly capture at-home consumption , but this does not represent total milk consumption. Approximately 50% of India\u2019s total milk production is consumed outside the home , in forms such as: Tea and coffee sold in restaurants, tea stalls, and roadside vendors. Dairy-based sweets like rasgulla, gulab jamun, and paneer dishes consumed in eateries. Packaged dairy drinks and flavoured milk products purchased from supermarkets.

India and China have taken significant steps to improve their bilateral relations, including resuming the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra this summer, restoring direct flights, issuing visas for journalists and think tanks, and sharing trans-border river data. These decisions followed a meeting between India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri and Chinese officials. What\u2019s in today\u2019s article? Fine print of India - China statements Analysis Fine print of India - China statements On the framing of the meeting India's Framing of the Meeting India\u2019s statement emphasized the review of the overall state of India-China bilateral relations, with a focus on people-centric steps to stabilize and rebuild ties. India highlighted the agreed actions from the previous meeting between PM Modi and President Xi Jinping in Kazan, conveying a cautious and nuanced approach to the discussions. China's Framing of the Meeting China, on the other hand, framed the discussions as being focused on the improvement and development of bilateral relations, noting that the two sides reached a consensus on specific measures. Beijing presented a more optimistic assessment of the talks, with a focus on progress and forward-looking outcomes. Kailash Mansarovar Yatra The statements from both India and China are similar regarding the resumption of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra , but the Chinese statement reflects more urgency, specifying it will happen \" as soon as possible .\" India stated that the yatra will resume in summer 2025 , with discussions on modalities taking place as per existing agreements. China, however, mentioned the visit would be to the Xizang Autonomous Region and emphasized that discussions on arrangements would be initiated quickly. Direct Flights India and China also agreed in principle to resume direct flights, but with slight differences in emphasis. India\u2019s statement highlighted the need for a new pact and for technical authorities from both sides to meet and negotiate an updated framework. China\u2019s statement, meanwhile, connected the resumption of flights with facilitating personnel flows and exchanges of resident journalists. Before the flights were suspended due to the pandemic and the Galwan clash in 2020, the two countries had 539 direct flights per month, with a total seat capacity of over 1.25 lakh. Currently, India has only one resident journalist in China, while China has none. Trans-Border River Cooperation India and China have agreed to hold an early meeting of the India-China Expert Level Mechanism to discuss issues related to trans-border rivers , including the sharing of hydrological data. This follows concerns raised by India about China\u2019s construction of the world\u2019s largest dam on the Brahmaputra River, which was cleared in January. India stated that the meeting would focus on the resumption of hydrological data provision and other forms of cooperation concerning trans-border rivers. China, similarly, emphasized the advancement of trans-border river cooperation and maintaining communication for an early meeting of the Expert Level Mechanism. Analysis India's Approach India advocated for a step-by-step approach to address areas of mutual interest and concern , particularly focusing on the border situation . The Indian statement highlighted the resumption of existing dialogues, agreeing to take a gradual approach in addressing each side\u2019s priorities through these mechanisms. China's Approach China maintained its long-term strategy for handling bilateral relations, emphasizing that both sides should view and manage relations based on the fundamental interests of their countries and peoples. The Chinese statement stressed the importance of advancing exchanges and practical cooperation with a constructive attitude , while enhancing mutual trust and managing differences. China called for promoting relations along a sound and stable track from a strategic and long-term perspective . Trade Concerns India raised specific concerns regarding market access and discussed the need for policy transparency and predictability in economic and trade areas. However, the Chinese statement did not address these concerns, leaving the issue unmentioned on their side. Support for SCO Presidency China mentioned that India would extend full support for China\u2019s presidency of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and actively participate in the meetings under the SCO umbrella. In contrast, India did not comment on this aspect in its statement. Differing Views on Mutual Relations China emphasized the importance of avoiding mutual suspicion, estrangement, and exhaustion in relations between the two countries. This framing contrasts with India\u2019s approach, as outlined by External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, who has described India\u2019s approach as focusing on mutual respect, mutual sensitivity, and mutual interests.

SEBI plans to launch a \u201cwhen-listed\u201d platform for trading of shares of companies that have finished their initial public offering (IPO) and are yet to be listed on stock exchanges. What\u2019s in today\u2019s article? When-Listed Platform Benefits of the \u201cWhen-Listed\u201d Facility for Investors Current timeline for listing of shares Grey Market Trading in IPOs When-Listed Platform This platform will facilitate trading of shares between IPO allotment and official listing, addressing concerns around unregulated markets. Reducing Grey Market Activity The grey market involves unofficial, unregulated trading of IPO shares based on demand and supply before listing. It operates in cash with no actual delivery of shares. Many retail investors use grey market premiums to evaluate IPO investments. Addressing Grey and Kerb Trading SEBI aims to eliminate grey and kerb trading during the T+3 period (time from IPO closure to listing) by introducing a regulated alternative. Grey market trading and kerb trading both refer to buying and selling shares outside official stock exchanges. This usually happens before a company\u2019s shares are officially listed after an IPO. Investors trade these shares at a grey market premium based on demand. The term \"kerb trading\" comes from the idea of trading on the street, highlighting its unofficial nature. It emphasized that this platform would formalize trading already happening unofficially, providing a transparent, regulated system. Collaboration with Stock Exchanges SEBI is working with stock exchanges to implement this platform, aiming to provide investors a safe and formal way to trade shares during the pre-listing period. Benefits of the \u201cWhen-Listed\u201d Facility for Investors Regulated Trading: Investors who have received IPO allotment can sell their entitlement in a regulated market, instead of the unregulated grey market. Sebi aims to eliminate the informal grey market trading and allow formal trading through an official platform. Reducing Market Volatility: The grey market is seen as a source of volatility and distorted market sentiments. The new platform will help control market instability by ensuring all trading is monitored by the regulator. Protecting Retail Investors: Market participants suggest that Sebi should address grey market activity starting from the IPO announcement to safeguard retail investors\u2019 interests. Current timeline for listing of shares Currently, after an IPO bidding closes, shares must be listed on stock exchanges within three working days (T+3). Shares are allotted on T+1 day. In the gap between allotment and listing, investors engage in grey market trading. Sebi aims to reduce this pre-listing grey market activity. Grey Market Trading in IPOs How it Works: Investors, due to low chances of IPO allotment, often enter the grey market. Trading begins once an IPO announcement is made, with brokers focusing solely on the grey market. A premium is added above the IPO price band (e.g., Rs 90-100 per share with a premium of Rs 10-30). Investors place bids with grey market operators to buy or sell shares. Settlement: The opening price on the official listing day determines the settlement. If the stock opens higher than the grey market price, operators pay the difference. If the stock opens lower, investors incur a loss.

Amid concerns over regulating AI without stifling innovation, global leaders will meet in Paris on February 10 for a two-day AI Action Summit. This builds on the 2023 AI Safety Summit in Bletchley Park , which focused on \"doomsday\" concerns and resulted in 25 states, including the US and China, signing the Bletchley Declaration on AI Safety. Additionally, the 2024 Seoul summit saw 16 leading AI companies voluntarily commit to transparent AI development.

It emphasizes aligning AI with human intent, safeguarding rights, and ensuring safety, ethics, and accountability. It highlights civil society's role and developers' responsibility for testing and mitigating AI risks. 2024 AI Seoul Summit The 2024 AI Seoul Summit was a two-day event that took place in May 2024. The summit was co-hosted by the Republic of Korea and the UK government. The summit's goal was to advance global discussions on AI safety, innovation, and inclusivity. The summit confirmed a shared understanding of the opportunities and risks posed by AI. It set minimum guardrails for AI use. It established a roadmap for ensuring AI safety. About Paris AI Summit The Paris AI Summit, an initiative of French President Emmanuel Macron, focuses on global AI governance, innovation, and advancing public interest. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will co-chair the summit and has accepted the invitation to attend. Key Objectives The summit aims to tackle the concentration of power in the AI market, particularly concerning foundational models controlled by companies like Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta. Event Structure February 10 \u2013 Multistakeholder Forum : This forum will bring together global representatives from governments, businesses, civil society, researchers, artists, and journalists. Activities include conferences, round tables, and presentations, focusing on AI-driven solutions. February 11 \u2013 Summit of Heads of State and Government: Leaders will convene at the Grand Palais to discuss key collaborative actions for AI governance. Paris Summit and Europe's AI Challenge The Paris AI Summit is crucial for Europe as AI development is increasingly seen as a race dominated by American tech giants and Chinese state power. French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s personal initiative underscores Europe\u2019s need to compete in this field. Many reports have highlighted European red tape and regulatory barriers hindering its tech sector's growth. Brussels is perceived as lagging behind, with limited chances of catching up. US AI Ambitions The summit follows Washington\u2019s announcement of the Stargate Project , a $500 billion initiative involving OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, Microsoft, and Nvidia to build cutting-edge AI infrastructure. This major investment highlights the US\u2019s commitment to dominating AI capabilities over the next four years. China\u2019s Rapid AI Advancements China\u2019s significant AI progress remains a key topic of concern. Despite US efforts to curtail its advancements, Chinese firms like DeepSeek have demonstrated cost-effective foundational AI models that rival OpenAI\u2019s o1 reasoning model in math, coding, and reasoning benchmarks. Similarly, Alibaba released a new AI model, reportedly comparable to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-o1 series, showcasing China's competitive edge in AI development. Diverse Approaches to AI Regulation Policymakers worldwide have intensified regulatory scrutiny of generative AI, focusing on three key concerns: privacy, system bias , and intellectual property violations . However, their approaches differ significantly.

United Kingdom: Light-Touch Approach UK has adopted a more lenient, innovation-friendly approach, emphasizing minimal regulatory barriers to foster growth in this emerging field. United States: Balanced but Shifting The US approach has been moderate, positioned between strict regulation and innovation promotion. However, recent developments could lead to further deregulation. China: Structured Measures for Control China has introduced its own regulatory measures, balancing AI advancements with oversight, particularly in areas critical to state interests.

The Supreme Court has eased its previous condition for appointing ad hoc judges in High Courts to clear pending criminal cases. It ruled that ad hoc appointments can be made even if vacancies do not exceed 20% of the sanctioned strength. The 20% condition was imposed by the Supreme Court in an April 2021 judgment in the Lok Prahari versus Union of India case. What\u2019s in today\u2019s article? Article 224A: Appointment of Retired Judges in High Courts Lok Prahari versus Union of India Condition for appointment of ad hoc judges to HCs relaxed Article 224A: Appointment of Retired Judges in High Courts The Chief Justice of a High Court, with the President\u2019s prior consent , can request a retired judge of that or any other High Court to serve as a judge in that state\u2019s High Court. Such judges will have the same jurisdiction, powers, and privileges as regular judges but will not be considered permanent judges. Their allowances will be determined by the President\u2019s order . Lok Prahari versus Union of India In Lok Prahari v. Union of India (2021), the Supreme Court invoked Article 224-A of the Constitution to allow the appointment of ad hoc judges in High Courts to address the backlog of cases. It set guidelines ensuring such appointments occur only after efforts to fill regular vacancies. The Chief Justice of a High Court may exercise this discretion if: vacancies exceed 20% of the sanctioned strength, cases in a category have been pending for over five years, over 10% of pending cases are older than five years, or the disposal rate is lower than the rate of new case filings. Condition for appointment of ad hoc judges to HCs relaxed The Supreme Court has allowed High Courts across India to appoint retired judges on an ad-hoc basis to address the backlog of criminal cases. These judges will only hear criminal appeals in benches headed by a sitting High Court judge. Guidelines for Appointment A special bench comprising Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna and Justices BR Gavai and Surya Kant ruled that: Chief Justices of High Courts can recommend retired judges for appointment. Each High Court may appoint 2 to 5 ad-hoc judges , not exceeding 10% of its sanctioned strength . Modification of Earlier Conditions The Supreme Court modified and kept in abeyance certain conditions set in its April 2021 ruling by then CJI SA Bobde, including: The earlier requirement that vacancies should not exceed 20% of sanctioned strength before appointing ad-hoc judges. The restriction that ad-hoc judges could sit separately on benches to deal with cases. No Fixed Timeline for Appointments The Supreme Court declined a request to set a fixed timeline for appointing ad-hoc judges but emphasized that the process should begin immediately. Addressing the Pendency Crisis The ruling was prompted by the acute backlog of cases . The High Courts have over 60 lakh cases pending, of which nearly 20 lakh are criminal appeals. The 80% working strength condition from the 2021 ruling had prevented ad-hoc appointments in several High Courts, such as Allahabad HC (80 judges out of 160 sanctioned strength).

An Opportunity to Settle Sri Lanka\u2019s Ethnic Problem Jan. 31, 2025 Context India's decision to name the Jaffna Cultural Centre after the Tamil poet -philosopher Thiruvalluvar is a symbolic move that underscores its deep historical and cultural ties with Sri Lanka. This gesture not only acknowledges the Tamil heritage but also serves as a diplomatic tool to reinforce India's influence in Sri Lanka , particularly among the Tamil-speaking population. However, beyond the cultural significance, the relationship between the two nations has been shaped by decades of political complexities, particularly regarding the Tamil issue and the implementation of the 13th Amendment (13A) to Sri Lanka\u2019s Constitution. Historical and Political Context of 13 th Amendment and India\u2019s Stance Historical and Political Context of 13 th Amendment India\u2019s involvement in Sri Lanka\u2019s Tamil issue dates back to the 1983 anti-Tamil pogrom, which led to its role as a mediator and later as an active player in resolving the ethnic conflict. This culminated in the Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987 , which resulted in the 13th Amendment , introducing Provincial Councils with limited autonomy. However, the amendment has remained a contentious issue , facing resistance from both Sinhalese nationalist groups and Tamil separatist forces. The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), the party of Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, has traditionally opposed 13A, viewing it as an imposition by India. Similarly, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE ), though advocating Tamil autonomy, rejected the amendment as inadequate. India\u2019s Stance on the 13th Amendment Despite over 35 years since its introduction, the full implementation of 13A remains elusive, especially in Tamil-majority areas. Successive Indian governments have consistently urged Sri Lanka to implement the amendment fully. However, recent developments, such as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s omission of any direct mention of 13A during Sri Lankan President Dissanayake\u2019s visit in December 2024, have raised questions about whether India is shifting its stance. While Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar reiterated India\u2019s call for devolution, Modi\u2019s silence suggests a possible recalibration of India's approach, potentially influenced by Sri Lanka\u2019s evolving domestic politics. Sri Lanka\u2019s Political Landscape and Devolution Debate The JVP and the NPP\u2019s Stance on Devolution A critical factor shaping the debate on devolution today is the stance of the JVP, a left-wing nationalist party that has historically opposed 13A. The party, which played a significant role in two armed uprisings (in 1971 and 1987-89), viewed the Indo-Lanka Accord and its resulting constitutional amendment as an infringement on Sri Lanka\u2019s sovereignty. This position has persisted even as the JVP evolved into a mainstream political force. Currently, the JVP leads the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) coalition , which has emerged as a dominant political force in Sri Lanka. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who hails from the JVP, has not explicitly stated whether his government will fully implement 13A. During his 2024 parliamentary election campaign in Jaffna, he largely avoided discussing the issues of power devolution and a political settlement for the Tamils , raising concerns that his administration may not prioritize Tamil autonomy. The Ambiguity in the NPP\u2019s Constitutional Promises The NPP\u2019s 2024 election manifesto promised to draft a new constitution that strengthens democracy and ensures equality for all citizens. However, it did not explicitly mention greater autonomy for the Tamil-majority Northern and Eastern provinces. Instead, it proposed a \"devolution of political and administrative power to every local government, district, and province \", suggesting a broader but less concrete approach to decentralisation. The manifesto also committed to holding provincial and local government elections within a year , a crucial step given that provincial councils have been defunct since 2019. However, it remains unclear whether these elections will lead to meaningful devolution or if they will merely reinforce existing administrative structures without addressing Tamil political demands. The Risk of Local Government Supplanting Provincial Councils One of the key debates in Sri Lanka\u2019s devolution discourse is whether local government bodies can serve as an alternative to provincial councils. Local bodies, such as municipal and district councils, have a much longer history in Sri Lanka than provincial councils and are responsible for grassroots governance. However, they lack the financial and administrative capacity to address broader regional challenges, particularly in the Tamil-majority areas, which continue to struggle with post-war reconstruction and economic underdevelopment. The fear among many Tamil leaders is that the government may prioritise strengthening local government ", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

Reevaluating India\u2019s Trade Policy - Budget Announcements, Tariff Strategies, and Global Integration Jan. 30, 2025 Context: While the Union Budget is not the primary forum for trade-related announcements, it has become an important medium to communicate India\u2019s global economic policy. The upcoming budget is expected to address trade deficits, currency stability, and export promotion. However, questions arise regarding the frequent policy changes and their impact on India\u2019s external trade objectives. Challenges with Frequent Tariff Adjustments: Policy instability: Frequent changes in customs duties create uncertainty and hinder investment and trade expansion. Example of mobile phone components: The fluctuating tariffs on lenses, Printed Circuit Board Assemblies (PCBAs), and chargers demonstrate inconsistency in trade policies, negatively impacting manufacturers. Impact on exports and FDI: Instability in trade policy discourages foreign investment and stagnates India\u2019s export growth, which remains at around 2% of global exports. The Need for Comprehensive Trade Policy Reform: Lowering tariffs alone is insufficient: Trade reforms should go beyond tariff reductions to ensure long-term consistency. Policy consistency: A dedicated committee should be established to draft and maintain a stable trade policy. India\u2019s Trade Agreements dilemma: The government remains hesitant to join global trade blocs like RCEP and CPTPP due to concerns about trade deficits and protecting domestic industries. RCEP vs CPTPP: RCEP: Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. It is a free trade agreement between 15 Asia-Pacific countries, signed in November 2020 and came into effect on January 1, 2022. CPTPP: Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. It is a free trade agreement between Canada and 10 other countries in the Indo-Pacific. Some difference between RCEP and CPTPP: CPTPP has an Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) provision, which allows foreign investors to sue states in international arbitration tribunals. RCEP does not have an ISDS provision. CPTPP includes provisions for labor issues and environmental protections , while RCEP does not. Reevaluating Trade Agreements - RCEP vs CPTPP: Impact of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs): India\u2019s trade deficit is often driven by intermediate goods imports, which improve domestic manufacturing. Growth in finished goods exports: Despite concerns, India has maintained a surplus in finished goods trade with ASEAN countries. Simulation analysis: RCEP risks: Heavily dominated by China, RCEP could exacerbate India\u2019s trade deficit. CPTPP benefits: With the exclusion of both the US and China, CPTPP offers a more balanced trade environment, potential for export growth, and alignment with India\u2019s long-term economic goals. The Way Forward: Trade openness alone is not enough: Structural reforms must accompany trade liberalization to address domestic inefficiencies. Reevaluation of trade pessimism: India must base its trade policy on informed discourse rather than nationalistic narratives. Strategic engagement with Global Value Chains (GVCs): A well-thought-out trade policy can help India achieve its ambitious export target of $2 trillion by 2030. Conclusion: India\u2019s trade policy needs a shift from protectionism to strategic global integration. A stable and well-structured trade approach, supported by long-term policy consistency, will enhance India\u2019s competitiveness in the global market.

Denotified Tribes Classification: A Step Towards Social Justice Jan. 29, 2025 Why in the News? After three years of research, the Anthropological Survey of India (AnSI) and Tribal Research Institutes (TRIs) have for the first time systematically categorized 268 denotified, semi-nomadic, and nomadic tribes across India. What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Historical Background (About Denotified Tribes, Various Commissions, etc.) Key Findings of the Report (Major Highlights, Way Forward, etc.) Historical Background and the Need for Classification: Denotified tribes were once labelled as \"criminal\" under the Criminal Tribes Act of 1924 , which was repealed in 1949. However, since then, various commissions\u2014including the Kaka Kalelkar Commission (1955), the Mandal Commission (1980), the Renke Commission (2008), and the Idate Commission (2017)\u2014have attempted but failed to fully classify these communities. The Idate Commission\u2019s 2017 report identified 1,200 denotified, semi-nomadic, and nomadic tribes and highlighted 267 unclassified communities. This led the Indian government to form a Special Committee under the NITI Aayog in 2019, which assigned AnSI and TRIs the task of ethnographic classification. Key Findings of the Study: 268 communities classified: For the first time, these tribes have been systematically documented. 179 communities recommended for SC/ST/OBC inclusion: This inclusion aims to provide reservation benefits. 63 communities found untraceable: These groups may have merged with other communities, changed names, or migrated. Political and legal implications: The classification has sparked debates on reservations and special status. Impact on Reservation and Welfare Policies: With this classification, denotified tribes could access government welfare schemes reserved for SCs, STs, and OBCs, including education and employment opportunities. However, this move has also raised political concerns. There are two competing views within the Development and Welfare Board for Denotified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Communities : Support for Inclusion in SC/ST/OBC Lists Ensures access to education, jobs, and social welfare schemes. Provides legal recognition and identity to these communities. Demand for a Separate Reservation Category Advocates argue that denotified tribes should have their own classification, similar to SCs and STs, rather than being merged into existing categories. Some fear that merging them into SC/ST/OBC groups might dilute reservation benefits for other communities. Challenges and Concerns: Political Controversies: Activists in states like Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat are questioning the basis of classification, fearing it may impact existing reservation structures. Delays in Implementation: Despite multiple commissions advocating for classification, government action has been slow, delaying welfare benefits. Historical Misclassification: Earlier census data mistakenly categorized some tribes as castes, creating confusion over their identity and legal status. Way Forward: The AnSI and TRIs have submitted their final report to the Special Committee under the NITI Aayog. Currently, the committee is reviewing recommendations before preparing a final report for the government. If the recommendations are accepted: State governments will have an easier pathway to include these tribes in reservation lists. New welfare policies could be introduced to address socio-economic inequalities faced by these communities. The debate on creating a separate category for denotified tribes may gain momentum. Conclusion: The classification of denotified, semi-nomadic, and nomadic tribes is a crucial step toward rectifying historical injustices and ensuring their access to government welfare schemes. However, the implementation process remains complex, with political and legal challenges ahead. The government\u2019s final decision on this matter will shape the socio-political landscape of reservation policies in India.

The U.S.\u2019s Immigration Blocks as a Self-Defeating Path Jan. 29, 2025 Context The global competition for skilled talent is reshaping economies and innovation landscapes The United States , historically a hub for technological advancements, has long benefited from skilled immigrants who not only fill jobs but create them. However, restrictive immigration policies, particularly concerning H-1B visas, threaten to undermine this advantage. A Closer Examination of the Flawed Logic of H-1B Visa Restrictions A Misguided Notion At the heart of the H-1B visa debate lies a pervasive yet misguided notion: that restricting skilled immigration will create more opportunities for native workers. On the surface, this argument appears intuitive, but a deeper dive into the data reveals a far more complex and counterproductive reality. Policies that limit skilled immigration fail to account for the interconnected nature of global labour markets. Also, these restrictions impact the dynamics of innovation-driven economies , and the tangible contributions of foreign talent to economic growth and job creation in the United States. Displacing Jobs, Not Protecting Them When H-1B visas are restricted, American companies rarely respond by hiring more U.S. workers; instead, they shift their focus to hiring abroad. This trend is not speculative ; it is supported by substantial evidence. A study by Britta Glennon found that when faced with stricter visa policies, U.S. firms accelerate foreign hiring, often relocating entire teams and operations to countries with more accessible talent pools, such as India and China. For every 10 H-1B visa applications denied, U.S. multinational companies hire an average of eight foreign workers in offshore locations. These are not simply replacement hires; they represent the relocation of innovation ecosystems, jobs, teams, and expertise, all moving overseas. Myths About Wage Suppression Another argument against the H-1B program is that it suppresses wages for native workers. Critics often claim that companies hire foreign workers to save on labour costs, but research debunks this myth. According to the American Immigration Council , the median wage for H-1B workers in 2021 was more than double that of the general U.S. workforce. Furthermore, between 2003 and 2021, wages for H-1B workers rose by 52%, compared to a 39% increase for all U.S. workers. Giovanni Peri\u2019s research demonstrates that hiring foreign STEM workers increases native wages, particularly in technical fields where innovation leads to higher productivity. These gains, which range from 30% to 50% of aggregate productivity growth, underscore the positive economic impact of skilled immigration. Economic and Technological Benefits of Skilled Immigration Employment Generation The contributions of skilled immigrants extend beyond employment figures. Research has consistently shown that H-1B visa holders stimulate job creation. Each H-1B worker, on average, generates 1.83 additional jobs for native-born American workers over a seven-year period. Additionally, immigrant-founded companies in the U.S. tend to attract higher investments and create more jobs than those founded by native-born entrepreneurs. According to the National Foundation for American Policy, more than half of America\u2019s billion-dollar startups were founded by immigrants. Innovation Driven Benefits The innovation-driven benefits of skilled immigration are undeniable. A 10% increase in foreign STEM workers correlates with a 0.5% to 0.6% rise in native wages and a 0.3% to 0.7% increase in patents per capita. Research by Jennifer Hunt reveals that a 1% rise in immigrant college graduates leads to a remarkable 9% to 18% surge in patents per capita. Given that up to 71% of tech workers in Silicon Valley are foreign-born, restrictive policies risk eroding America\u2019s technological leadership and global competitiveness. Broader Implications of H-1B Visa Restrictions Innovation at Risk One of the most concerning consequences of H-1B restrictions is the impact on innovation. Skilled immigrants are disproportionately responsible for patents , technological breakthroughs, and high-growth startups. Studies reveal that a 10% increase in foreign STEM workers leads to a 0.3% to 0.7% increase in patents per capita and a corresponding rise in native wages. Immigrants, many of whom arrive in the U.S. through programs like the H-1B, account for a significant share of technological advancements, particularly in tech hubs like Silicon Valley. Stalling Broader Economic Growth The U.S. labour market operates differently in knowledge-driven sectors, where talent scarcity is a pressing issue. In such industries, skilled workers, especially in STEM fields, are not interchangeable with less specialised labour. Rather than protecting domestic jobs, these caps restrict American companies from scaling their operations, which hinders job creation for native workers", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

An Enduring Commitment to the Indo-Pacific Jan. 27, 2025 Context The inauguration of Donald Trump as the 47th President of the United States marks an extraordinary political comeback, reshaping American politics and signalling a critical moment in global geopolitics. Central to the vision of Trump\u2019s administration is the Indo-Pacific region , which plays a vital role in shaping global trade, security, and stability. Therefore, it is crucial to explore the Indo-Pacific's growing significance, analyses the evolution of U.S. policy, and outlines the potential trajectory of Trump\u2019s approach to the region. The Indo-Pacific Region Under Trump\u2019s First Term: Redefining the Indo-Pacific A New Geopolitical Lens Trump\u2019s administration popularised the term \u2018Indo-Pacific,\u2019 moving beyond the narrower Asia-Pacific framework to encompass a broader geographical and strategic focus. This semantic shift underscored the significance of the Indian Ocean alongside East Asia, reflecting Washington\u2019s commitment to countering China's growing influence in both maritime and terrestrial spheres. The Indo-Pacific narrative emphasised securing vital sea lines of communication, addressing maritime security challenges , and maintaining a balance of power in a region central to global trade and security. Institutional and Structural Reforms Significant structural adjustments further cemented the region's importance in U.S. strategic thinking. The renaming of the U.S. Pacific Command to the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command in 2018 symbolised the operational prioritisation of the region. Moreover, the Office of the Secretary of Defence reorganised its framework to establish specialised units focusing on partnerships with Indo-Pacific allies , signalling a long-term commitment to safeguarding regional stability. Revival of the Quad Perhaps most crucially, the Trump administration revitalised the Quad, elevating it from an informal dialogue to a ministerial-level engagement. This reflected a pragmatic convergence of interests among the United States, India, Japan, and Australia in countering shared challenges, including China's assertiveness in the South China Sea and the need for resilient supply chains. Maritime security, technological cooperation, and standards-setting became focal points of the Quad , laying the groundwork for deeper collaboration in maintaining a rules-based order. Indo-Pacific Under Biden Continuity with a Broader Agenda The Biden administration inherited Trump\u2019s Indo-Pacific framework , maintaining its strategic centrality while expanding its scope. Biden elevated the Quad further by organising the first Quad leaders\u2019 summit in 2021, broadening its focus beyond defence to include pressing global challenges like vaccine distribution, climate change, and critical infrastructure development. This approach reflected a blend of hard and soft power, emphasising multilateralism and inclusive development to strengthen the Indo-Pacific's stability and prosperity. Introduction of Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) Biden also introduced the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) in 2022 to complement strategic priorities with economic engagement. These efforts underlined a bipartisan consensus in Washington on the Indo-Pacific's critical role, providing a solid foundation for Trump\u2019s second term to build upon. Potential Trajectory of Trump\u2019s Approach to the Indo-Pacific Region Countering China\u2019s Assertiveness The administration views China not only as a regional competitor but also as a global adversary with ambitions to challenge the U.S.-led world order. Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s remarks, describing China as the most formidable adversary, underscore the administration\u2019s commitment to adopting a more confrontational stance. This may involve increased freedom-of-navigation operations in contested areas like the South China Sea, expanded sanctions against Chinese entities, and intensified efforts to counter Beijing\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative by offering alternative development projects to nations in the region. The U.S. is expected to lead a coalition of like-minded countries to deter coercive actions by China, particularly those that seek to alter the status quo through force or intimidation. Strengthening the Quad as a Pillar of Regional Stability The Quad remains a cornerstone of Trump\u2019s Indo-Pacific strategy . The grouping of the U.S., India, Japan, and Australia is seen as a vital mechanism for promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific. Trump\u2019s administration will likely prioritise making the Quad more operational , with an emphasis on joint military exercises, intelligence sharing, and coordinated responses to maritime security challenges. The revival of the Quad during Trump\u2019s first term was a reflection of its strategic necessity, and his administration is poised to take it further.

The Eighth Wonder of Economic Growth - Understanding the Nuances of Sustainability Jan. 28, 2025 Context: Albert Einstein\u2019s analogy of compound interest as the \u201ceighth wonder of the world\u201d applies aptly to economic growth. India\u2019s long-term growth potential is immense, with a projected GDP per capita increase from $2,650 to $10,000 by 2045 at a 6% real growth rate. Even a slightly lower growth rate of 5.5% can achieve the same target, albeit by 2047. The key lies in sustainable, low-risk growth over extended periods. Key Challenges to India\u2019s Economic Growth: Debt-fueled growth and rising household indebtedness: Changing borrowing patterns: Unlike earlier generations, modern households borrow not just for emergencies or appreciating assets but increasingly for depreciating assets and experiences. Click-driven EMIs: The proliferation of e-commerce and the ease of borrowing through digital platforms have encouraged debt-led consumption . While this boosts short-term growth, it shifts the burden to the future. Impact on consumption and growth: Rising household debt and increasing retail non-performing assets (NPAs) necessitate measures to slow personal loan growth, ensuring more sustainable consumption patterns. Need for conscious choices: Encouraging cash-down purchases through better pricing over EMIs can promote financial discipline, akin to the lessons of the marshmallow test, which emphasizes delayed gratification. Competitive pressure from China: China\u2019s manufacturing dominance: Despite the China+1 strategy , India faces stiff competition due to China\u2019s strong manufacturing base, policy support, and surplus capacity. Weak domestic demand in China has led to export price deflation, complicating matters for Indian exporters. India\u2019s gradual progress: While India has the potential to increase its manufacturing share, achieving competitiveness requires sustained effort and investment. Global and domestic economic headwinds: Rising US interest rates: Higher US rates and a strong dollar have reduced the yield gap between India and the US, impacting foreign investments. Decline in net FDI: Sales of stakes by multinational corporations in Indian arms, driven by valuations rather than pessimism, have contributed to the fall in foreign direct investment. Stock market overvaluation: The enthusiasm for small and mid-cap stocks, fueled by post-Covid recoveries and new retail investors, may lead to overvaluation risks. Investors should heed the principle of \u201creversion to the mean\u201d for long-term stability. Strategies for Sustainable Growth: Disciplined borrowing practices: Regulating personal loans and promoting conscious financial decisions can build a more resilient economy. Boosting manufacturing competitiveness: Long-term policies, investments in infrastructure, and skill development are essential for India to compete with China\u2019s manufacturing prowess. Cautious investment approach: Educating new retail investors about market cycles and avoiding speculative tendencies in IPOs and mid-cap investments will foster stability. Policy and structural support: The government\u2019s proactive role in supporting manufacturing, tackling inflation, and encouraging foreign investments will be critical. Conclusion - The Path to $10,000 Per Capita GDP: India\u2019s journey to achieving a GDP per capita of $10,000 is plausible with sustainable growth strategies. However, this requires addressing challenges like debt-fueled consumption, global competition, and market exuberance. By fostering financial discipline, bolstering manufacturing , and adopting a cautious investment approach, India can ensure long-term economic resilience and prosperity.

Genocide and the World\u2019s Averted Gaze Jan. 27, 2025 Context Eighty years ago, on January 27, 1945 , Soviet soldiers liberated Auschwitz-Birkenau, encountering a horrific scene of emaciated prisoners and remnants of systematic murder. Among the haunting artifacts were 44,000 pairs of shoes and mounds of spectacles , silent witnesses to the atrocities committed against ~1.1 million people, predominantly European Jews. This tragic moment in history epitomised the devastating consequences of hatred and indifference, compelling the world to collectively vow \u2018never again\u2019 to the horrors of genocide. Yet, as history has painfully demonstrated, this promise remains unfulfilled, and the shadows of such atrocities continue to loom over humanity. The Crime of Genocide: An Enduring Stain The 1948 Genocide Convention defines genocide as acts committed with the intent to destroy , in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group. This definition underscores the systematic nature of such crimes, rooted in prejudice and power. The Holocaust, with its meticulous Nazi codification of Jewish persecution beginning in 1933, culminated in the industrialised killing of six million Jews alongside countless Roma, Sinti, political dissidents, and others deemed inferior. While the Allies were not fully aware of the extent of this horror, the Nuremberg Laws, the Kristallnacht pogroms, and accounts from Jewish refugees foreshadowed the genocide to come. Tragically, bureaucratic barriers, xenophobia, and antisemitism hindered timely intervention , leaving millions to face annihilation. The Reality of \u2018Never Again\u2019 The Cambodian Genocide (1975\u20131979) One of the most harrowing examples of the world\u2019s failure occurred during the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia. Pol Pot and his government pursued a radical vision of agrarian communism , systematically targeting intellectuals, professionals, religious groups , and ethnic minorities. Over two million people perished due to executions, forced labour, starvation, and disease . The genocide unfolded while global powers prioritised Cold War allegiances over humanitarian concerns. China and the West supported the Khmer Rouge to counter Vietnam and its Soviet-aligned government, even after Vietnam intervened and ousted Pol Pot in 1979. International condemnation was overshadowed by political calculations , leaving millions of victims to suffer in silence. The Rwandan Genocide (1994) In Rwanda, the genocide unfolded at a staggering pace, with nearly one million people, mostly minority Tutsi and moderate Hutu, slaughtered within 100 days. The world watched in horror but failed to act. The United Nations peacekeepers in Rwanda, under-resourced and constrained by strict mandates, were powerless to stop the violence. Despite clear warning signs , including hate propaganda disseminated by Rwandan radio stations and the stockpiling of weapons, the global community delayed its response. When help did arrive, it was too little, too late. Rwanda stands as a grim reminder of how bureaucratic inertia, lack of political will, and international indifference can result in catastrophic consequences. The Srebrenica Massacre (1995) The Srebrenica massacre in Bosnia further exemplifies the world\u2019s failure to prevent genocide. Declared a UN safe zone during the Bosnian Wa r, Srebrenica became a symbol of false security. In July 1995, Bosnian Serb forces overran the enclave, separating men and boys from women and children. Over 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were systematically executed in what became Europe\u2019s worst atrocity since World War II. UN peacekeepers, under Dutch command, were unable to prevent the massacre, as requests for reinforcements from NATO and the UN went unanswered. This tragedy was not merely a failure of protection but also of recognition , as the global community grappled with how to respond to ethnic cleansing within Europe. The Darfur Genocide (2003\u20132005) In Darfur, Sudan, another genocide unfolded under the world\u2019s gaze. The Sudanese government, in collaboration with Janjaweed militias, targeted non-Arab ethnic groups through systematic killings, displacement, and sexual violence. By the time the international community acknowledged the scale of the atrocities, over 200,000 people had been killed, and millions were displaced. While the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Sudanese leaders, including President Omar al-Bashir, geopolitical interests and diplomatic inertia limited the enforcement of justice. Today, violence continues to plague Sudan , with fears of renewed genocide as global attention shifts elsewhere. Gaza: A Contemporary Crisis The ongoing humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza adds another layer to this grim narrative. As the world commemorates the liberation of Auschwitz, Gazans sift through rubble, searching for loved ones among the estimated 10,000 missing.

Getting Drunk, on Homoeopathy Jan. 28, 2025 Context A recent judgment of the Supreme Court of India in Bhagwati Medical Hall vs Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation has reignited debate on a pressing public health issue: the regulation of alcoholic tinctures marketed as homeopathic remedies. The judgment highlights the complex regulatory architecture , economic implications, and public health hazards associated with these products. Despite sporadic attempts to address the issue, regulatory hurdles and industry resistance have left state governments grappling with an impossible challenge. The Complexity of Regulatory Framework Governing Alcoholic Tinctures in India Constitutional Provisions and Division of Powers The governance of alcoholic tinctures is shaped by multiple entries in the Constitution's Seventh Schedule , which allocates legislative authority between the Union and state governments. According to Schedule VII, states have the exclusive power to legislate on public health and the taxation of alcohol under List II (State List). This makes states the primary authority responsible for public health measures and alcohol-related laws within their territories. However, an exception exists: alcohol meant for medicinal purposes falls under Entry 84 of List I (Union List) , granting the Union government the authority to regulate its taxation. This constitutional division creates a regulatory grey area. While the states are tasked with ensuring public health, they have limited powers to regulate medicinal alcohol due to the Union\u2019s jurisdiction over its taxation and standards. This dual control creates a situation where neither authority can fully address the issue. Concurrent Jurisdiction Over Drugs Drugs, including homeopathic products, fall under the Concurrent List (List III), which allows both the Union and state governments to legislate. However, the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, a central legislation, lays down the quality standards for homeopathic drugs , including alcoholic tinctures. This Act prevents states from unilaterally amending provisions or introducing stricter regulations without presidential assent. As a result, states have limited scope to address local public health concerns arising from the misuse of these tinctures. Quality Regulation and Taxation Loopholes The regulatory complexity has allowed manufacturers of homeopathic alcoholic tinctures to largely escape oversight. Unlike alcoholic beverages, which are subject to rigorous quality checks and taxation by state excise departments, these tinctures operate under the more lenient framework of medicinal alcohol. Manufacturers have exploited these loopholes to produce and market tinctures with alcohol content as high as 12%, which is legally permissible under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act. In contrast, popular alcoholic beverages such as \u2018strong beer\u2019 contain only 7% alcohol by volume. This disparity not only makes tinctures an attractive alternative for those seeking intoxication but also undermines the efforts of state governments to regulate alcohol consumption. Challenges in Regulating Alcoholic Tinctures Industry Lawfare Efforts to regulate alcoholic tinctures have been consistently thwarted by the homeopathic industry's aggressive legal strategies. After the Union government introduced Rule 106B to the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945 in 1994\u2014capping the alcohol content at 12% and limiting retail bottle sizes\u2014 the industry mounted a legal challenge. Over two decades, these lawsuits questioned the rule's constitutionality , its scientific basis, and procedural lapses in its enactment. Regulatory Hurdles and Systematic Inefficiencies Although the Supreme Court and multiple High Courts upheld the rule , subsequent litigation targeted technical flaws, such as the failure to table the rule in Parliament. Despite the simplicity of resolving this issue , placing the rule before Parliament for 30 days, the Union government chose prolonged litigation delaying enforcement. By 2017, the Supreme Court consolidated these cases , but the matter remains unresolved. These delays highlight systemic inefficiencies that jeopardize public health. Broader Implications of Alcoholic Tinctures Revenue Concerns Revenue losses arise when consumers opt for these low-tax tinctures over higher-taxed alcoholic beverages. More alarmingly, states like Gujarat and Bihar, which prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages, report fatalities linked to the consumption of spurious homeopathic tinctures. Such incidents undermine state-level alcohol prohibition policies, creating a public health crisis. Health Concerns Unsuspecting consumers , often unaware of the alcohol content in these tinctures, may develop severe conditions like alcoholic hepatitis. Doctors have observed a worrying trend of patients exhibiting symptoms typically associated with chronic alcohol consumption after using these so-called remedies.

Chinese startup DeepSeek has launched AI models that compete with top U.S. models at a much lower cost. In December 2024, the company revealed that training its DeepSeek-V3 model cost less than $6 million using Nvidia H800 chips. DeepSeek\u2019s AI Assistant is now the top-rated free app on Apple\u2019s U.S. App Store, beating ChatGPT. This has raised questions about why U.S. tech companies are spending billions on AI. It has also affected the stock prices of big companies like Nvidia. What\u2019s in today\u2019s article? DeepSeek: A New Chatbot Rival to ChatGPT DeepSeek: Causing a stir The AI Race: A Strategic Moment for India DeepSeek: A New Chatbot Rival to ChatGPT DeepSeek is a free AI-powered chatbot that functions similarly to ChatGPT. It can perform various tasks, though its effectiveness compared to rivals remains debated. Performance and Efficiency DeepSeek\u2019s R1 model is reportedly as powerful as OpenAI\u2019s o1, excelling in mathematics and coding. It is a \"reasoning\" model that processes responses incrementally, using less memory and reducing operational costs. Censorship and Limitations Like other Chinese AI models, DeepSeek avoids politically sensitive topics. When asked about the Tiananmen Square massacre, it refused to provide details, highlighting Chinese government-imposed censorship. Cost-Effective AI Development DeepSeek claims to have trained its model for just $6 million, significantly lower than the over $100 million OpenAI spent on GPT-4. The company\u2019s founder reportedly stockpiled Nvidia A100 chips\u2014banned from export to China since 2022\u2014pairing them with cheaper chips to develop the AI. Security Challenges and Outages After becoming the most-downloaded free app on Apple\u2019s U.S. App Store, DeepSeek faced large-scale cyberattacks, forcing temporary registration limits. The company also experienced website outages. DeepSeek: causing a stir DeepSeek Challenges U.S. AI Dominance The launch of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT in 2022 spurred Chinese tech firms to develop their own AI chatbots. However, early models, such as Baidu\u2019s, failed to meet expectations, highlighting a gap between Chinese and U.S. AI capabilities. DeepSeek has reversed this perception with high-quality and cost-efficient models. DeepSeek\u2019s Cost-Effective Advantage DeepSeek\u2019s AI models, DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1, have received praise from Silicon Valley executives and engineers. The company claims its models match OpenAI and Meta\u2019s best AI systems while being significantly cheaper to use. The AI Race: A Strategic Moment for India PM Modi's upcoming participation in the AI summit in Paris highlights India\u2019s need to carefully assess the implications of the escalating AI competition between the US and China, especially following the release of DeepSeek R1. The DeepSeek-Sputnik Parallel DeepSeek R1\u2019s release is being compared to the Soviet Union\u2019s launch of Sputnik in 1957, which shocked the US and spurred an intense space race. Similarly, DeepSeek has intensified the technological rivalry between the US and China, setting a new frontier for great power competition. US-China AI Rivalry: A Bipolar Landscape China, with its large GDP and investments in frontier technologies, is a formidable AI competitor to the US. The competition is expected to remain bipolar, leaving other nations, including India, struggling to keep pace. However, how this rivalry unfolds remains uncertain. Doing More with Less: Lessons for Middle Powers DeepSeek has demonstrated the potential to achieve innovation with limited resources. This provides hope for middle powers like India and France, which cannot match US-China spending but can still remain relevant in the AI domain by focusing on strategic innovation and cooperation. Sovereign AI and Partnerships India and France advocate for \u201cSovereign AI,\u201d focusing on balancing cooperation with the US and independent AI development. A partnership model between the US and its allies, including India, could help compete with China. However, India must address US concerns about technology leakage to Russia to strengthen this partnership. Cooperation Amid Rivalry Historical examples like US-Soviet cooperation in outer space during the Cold War suggest that the US and China could eventually collaborate on global AI governance. Such cooperation may focus on preventing AI misuse and controlling its destabilizing effects, much like nuclear deterrence regimes. India's Strategic Role in Global AI Governance India must avoid past mistakes, such as being sidelined in the global nuclear governance framework, by clearly defining its AI strategy. Delhi has the opportunity to shape global AI governance rather than remain a passive participant. Conclusion The AI race presents both challenges and opportunities for India.

The Yamuna Crisis - Beyond Politics Jan. 31, 2025 Context: The issue of the Yamuna river\u2019s contamination has turned into a political controversy , with Ex. Delhi Chief Minister accusing Haryana of polluting Delhi\u2019s water supply. As legal battles ensue and the Election Commission intervenes, it is essential to examine the health of the Yamuna beyond political rhetoric. Key Issues Related to the Yamuna: Three major concerns regarding the Yamuna and Delhi's water supply are: Drinking Water Supply Pollution Environmental Flow Drinking Water Supply: The supply challenges: Delhi's drinking water comes primarily from Haryana , with major inlets at Wazirabad Barrage, which depends on releases from Haryana\u2019s Hathni Kund Barrage. Delhi\u2019s treatment plants (Wazirabad, Chandrawal, Okhla, Haiderpur, and Bawana) rely entirely on Haryana\u2019s water supply. Water shortages arise during lean seasons , forcing plant shutdowns and leading to supply of untreatable water and water scarcity crisis. The ammonia issue in Delhi\u2019s water: Ammonia, a colorless gas with a sharp odor, dissolves in water and is widely used in industries, fertilizers, and cleaning agents. It enters water bodies through industrial effluents, agricultural runoff, and untreated sewage. High ammonia levels in the Yamuna, caused by industrial discharge from Panipat and Sonipat and sewage from colonies, impact water quality by reducing dissolved oxygen . Water treatment plants in Delhi cannot process ammonia levels above 1 part per million (ppm) , leading to disruptions in the capital\u2019s water supply. How is ammonia-laden water treated? The Delhi Jal Board (DJB) uses chlorine to neutralize ammonia in water treatment plants. Approximately 11.5 kg of chlorine is needed per litre of water per hour to counteract one ppm of ammonical nitrogen. Efficiency of treatment plants drops in winter due to increased ammonia levels. Government actions on ammonia contamination: A long-term solution has yet to be implemented by Delhi and Haryana governments. In March 2023, Delhi proposed an in-situ ammonia treatment plant at Wazirabad, but it remains under development. Haryana has not completed laying pipelines to prevent pollutant mixing in the river. Pollution - A Lingering Threat: Apart from ammonia contamination, multiple factors contribute to Yamuna\u2019s pollution: Unregulated sewage discharge: Sewage flows into stormwater drains due to incomplete sewer connections in unauthorized colonies. Industrial waste: Unlicensed household industries discharge untreated effluents. Solid waste dumping: Illegal dumping continues despite regulations. Key findings and unfulfilled commitments: The National Green Tribunal\u2019s Yamuna Monitoring Committee (YMC) (2018\u20132021) identified 16 major polluters , including Delhi Jal Board and authorities from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The Najafgarh, Supplementary, and Shahdara drains are major contributors to pollution. Haryana had committed to setting up Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) but failed to implement them fully. Delhi\u2019s Interceptor Project aimed at treating sewage before discharge has seen partial success but remains ineffective due to incomplete execution. Environmental Flow - The Need for Sustained Water Levels: The National Institute of Hydrology ( NIH ) study highlighted that excessive water withdrawals upstream drastically reduce Yamuna\u2019s flow through Delhi. Reduced flow increases pollutant concentration and disrupts aquatic life. The YMC recommended revisiting the 1994 water-sharing agreement between Delhi, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh for fairer water distribution. Regulatory intervention by the central government or courts is necessary to ensure a sustainable environmental flow. Conclusion - The Need for Political Will and Action: While reports and recommendations exist, implementation remains weak due to political and bureaucratic inertia. Unless policymakers, engineers, and administrators take decisive action, neither political promises nor manifestos will have any real impact. Citizens must recognize the gravity of the crisis and demand accountability to ensure the Yamuna\u2019s restoration and sustainable management .

The Union Budget as a Turning Point for Climate Action Jan. 28, 2025 Context The Union Budget 2026 presents a critical juncture for India as it grapples with the dual challenge of climate change and economic resilience. With just five years remaining to achieve the first interim Net-Zero target, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman must navigate an intricate balancing act \u2014addressing the urgency of climate adaptation and mitigation while ensuring economic growth. The Budget can catalyse transformative policy measures that can safeguard vulnerable communities, boost India\u2019s global competitiveness , and accelerate progress toward sustainable development. India\u2019s Progress in Climate Action PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana This flagship initiative aims to promote solar energy adoption in residential households, enhancing energy access while reducing carbon footprints. Over 1.45 crore households have registered under this scheme , showcasing strong public interest. National Green Hydrogen Mission With an increased budgetary allocation, this initiative seeks to position India as a global hub for green hydrogen production. This is a critical step toward decarbonizing industries like steel, cement, and transportation. Viability Gap Funding for Offshore Wind Energy The government\u2019s support for offshore wind energy projects reflects its ambition to diversify renewable energy sources. Offshore wind energy holds significant potential for reducing dependency on fossil fuels and achieving long-term energy security. Electric Vehicle (EV) Infrastructure Support By investing in EV charging infrastructure, India is addressing one of the key barriers to EV adoption, range anxiety. This initiative is pivotal to reducing emissions from the transport sector , which accounts for a significant portion of urban pollution. Remaining Gaps in India\u2019s Climate Action Plan Renewable Energy Capacity Gap India\u2019s installed renewable energy capacity stands at 203.18 GW, significantly short of the 500 GW target set for 2030. Bridging this gap requires unprecedented levels of investment, improved policy frameworks, and streamlined execution. Implementation Challenges in Solar Energy The PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana highlights the disparity between policy intent and execution. While registrations for the scheme have crossed 1.45 crore households, the actual completion rate remains dismal, with only 6.34 lakh installations (4.37%). This points to systemic issues such as bureaucratic inefficiencies , funding shortages, and a lack of robust monitoring mechanisms. Dependence on Imports for Solar Modules India\u2019s solar manufacturing ecosystem remains underdeveloped, fulfilling only 40% of domestic demand. This reliance on imports makes renewable energy projects more expensive and vulnerable to global supply chain disruptions. Additionally, domestically manufactured solar panels cost 65% more than imported alternatives, discouraging their adoption. Underutilised Potential in Railways India\u2019s vast railway network, which includes extensive land banks and track corridors, offers untapped opportunities for renewable energy generation. Estimates suggest the network could host up to 5 GW of solar and wind installations , yet this potential remains largely unexplored due to a lack of targeted public-private partnerships and investment incentives. Lack of Comprehensive Fiscal and Policy Measures Existing fiscal incentives and subsidies often fall short of addressing critical barriers to renewable energy adoption. For instance, the high upfront costs associated with solar installations deter low-income households , despite the availability of schemes like the Renewal Energy Service Company (RESCO) model. Comprehensive measures to reduce these costs and increase affordability are urgently needed. Expectations from Union Budget 2026 Pertaining to Transformative Policy Measures Adapting to International Market Dynamics India\u2019s export sector faces a looming challenge with the European Union\u2019s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), set to take effect in 2026. This measure, imposing carbon levies on imports, could impact India\u2019s exports to the EU, valued at $8.22 billion annually. The implications for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), contributing 30% of GDP and 45% of exports, are profound. To mitigate this, the Budget should establish a dedicated \u2018Climate Action Fund\u2019 modelled on Japan\u2019s Green Transformation Fund. This fund can support industrial decarbonisation in vulnerable sectors and build MSME capacity to comply with CBAM regulations , ensuring export competitiveness. Transitioning to a Circular Economy The adoption of a circular economy offers India significant economic and environmental benefits. A recent study estimates a potential profit of \u20b940 lakh crore annually by 2050 and a 44% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.

Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar criticized the party whip system, stating it restricts MPs' freedom of expression and enforces servility by compelling them to follow the party line. Speaking to students recently, he questioned the necessity of whips, arguing that they prevent representatives from using independent judgment. The whip system is perceived as crucial for ensuring party discipline, particularly during significant votes in Parliament, with penalties like expulsion for non-compliance. What\u2019s in today\u2019s article? Whip System Introduction to the Whip System in India Types of Whips Key Roles in the Whip System Significance of the Whip System About Whip System The term \"whip\" originates from England's hunting fields, where a whipper-in was tasked with keeping stray hounds within the pack. Introduction to Politics The political use of the term is credited to Edmund Burke, an Anglo-Irish politician and philosopher. In a speech in the House of Commons, he described how the King\u2019s ministers rallied their supporters, referring to it as \u201cwhipping them in.\u201d Introduction to the Whip System in India The whip system in India dates back to the beginning of its parliamentary history and plays a crucial role in maintaining party discipline, particularly during important votes. Legal and Democratic Context The Anti-Defection Law, enacted in 1985, enforces compliance with the whip system to preserve the integrity of political parties in India\u2019s parliamentary democracy. While some view the system as restrictive, even the Supreme Court has upheld its necessity for maintaining party discipline and stability in governance . Purpose of the Whip System Parties see voting on key issues as central to their political identity and expect MPs to align with the party line. Non-compliance or absence during critical votes can cause significant embarrassment. Significance During Division Voting For ruling parties or coalitions, unanimous attendance and compliance during division votes are vital to showcase their majority strength. Failure to do so could lead to a no-confidence motion in the Lok Sabha. Role of the Party Whip The party chief whip acts as the liaison between the leadership and MPs, communicating the party's stance on critical matters, ensuring attendance during votes, and coordinating which members speak on specific issues in Parliament. Types of Whips One-Line Whip : Informs members about a vote but allows them to abstain. Two-Line Whip : Requires members to be present but does not dictate how to vote. Three-Line Whip : The strictest directive, instructing members to be present and vote as per the party line. Significance of the Three-Line Whip The three-line whip, typically issued by the party\u2019s chief whip, mandates strict adherence. Violation can lead to disqualification under the Anti-Defection Law, as recommended by the party leader to the House's Presiding Officer. Key Roles in the Whip System The chief whip of a political party holds the most crucial role in enforcing the whip system, supported by additional whips within the party. Government\u2019s Chief Whip In the Lok Sabha , the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs acts as the government\u2019s chief whip, coordinating with ruling alliance leaders to issue a three-line whip. In the Rajya Sabha, the Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs serves as the government\u2019s chief whip. Consequences of Violating a Whip If a member of the ruling alliance defies the chief whip\u2019s directive, the party leader can recommend the member\u2019s disqualification to the Presiding Officer. For members, compliance with their party whip\u2019s directions remains paramount. Significance of the Whip System The whip system ensures discipline and coherence within political parties, crucial for the functioning of Parliamentary democracy. According to experts, the outcome of a single vote in Parliament can determine the fate of legislation or even the Council of Ministers. Role in Parliamentary Democracy Former Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan emphasized that MPs elected on a party ticket represent the party\u2019s ideology and policies. While internal disagreements can be voiced within party forums, compliance with the party\u2019s final decision is necessary, ensuring accountability and unity. Platform for Exchange: All-India Whips Conference Since 1952, the All-India Whips Conference is organized by the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs. The Conference has provided a platform for whips from all political parties, both ruling and Opposition, to share views and strategies, promoting better coordination in Parliamentary processes Understanding the Whip System.pdf ( Size: 3.0 MB ) Latest Article See All IndiGo Meltdown Dec. 5, 2025, 2:34 p.m. Economics India to Expand Its Busiest Rail Corridors: What\u2019s Planned Dec. 5, 2025, 2:08 p.m. Economics Census 2027 - Counting India, Renewing the Republic Dec. 5, 2025, 1:", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/vajiram_articles_formatted.csv"}

{"id": "276e7906-ca38-4cc1-86c5-d3b0a279ee86", "text": "Home / Mains Articles / Should Governors Be Ch... Should Governors Be Chancellors of State Universities? Jan. 27, 2025 What\u2019s in Today\u2019s Article? Historical Context (Governor\u2019s Role, Origin, Power, etc.) Current System (Challenges, Insights from Commissions, Reform Models, etc.) Historical Context of the Governor\u2019s Role: The role of Governors as Chancellors of State universities in India traces its roots to colonial-era policies. Introduced in 1857 with the establishment of universities in Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras , this model aimed to maintain British control over educational institutions. Post-independence, the system was retained without reconsideration of its relevance in a democratic and federal context. Governors, in their capacity as Chancellors, wield significant authority over universities, including appointing Vice-Chancellors, nominating syndicate members, and approving university statutes. However, this role has often led to conflicts, especially in states governed by opposition parties. Challenges of the Current System: Politicization of the Role : From the late 1960s, Governors transitioned from neutral figures to politically influenced appointees. Studies reveal that 52% of Governors between 1950 and 2015 were active politicians , undermining the credibility of the position. Conflicting Authorities : The dual accountability of universities to both state governments and Governors has led to governance challenges, including delays in appointments and decision-making. Lack of Expertise : Many Governors lack the academic qualifications necessary to guide universities effectively. This gap often results in non-transparent decisions and political interference. Erosion of Federal Principles : Allowing centrally appointed Governors to control state-funded institutions dilutes federalism, reducing universities\u2019 accountability to state governments. Insights from Commissions and Alternatives: Several commissions have highlighted the limitations of the Governor\u2019s role: Sarkaria Commission (1983-88) : Recognized the Governor\u2019s statutory role but recommended consultations with Chief Ministers in university matters. M. M. Punchhi Commission (2007-10) : Advocated for separating the Governor\u2019s constitutional and statutory roles, suggesting that states appoint eminent academicians as Chancellors. Reform Models: Ceremonial Role : States like Gujarat, Karnataka, and Maharashtra have redefined the Governor\u2019s role to a ceremonial one, acting on the advice of the Council of Ministers. State-Appointed Chancellors : Telangana and Kerala propose appointing distinguished academicians or public figures as Chancellors, but such reforms face delays in Presidential assent. University-Elected Chancellors : Global practices, like those in Oxford and Melbourne, allow university bodies to elect Chancellors, ensuring autonomy and accountability. Need for Progressive Reforms: The colonial legacy of Governors as Chancellors must be dismantled to ensure university autonomy, foster academic excellence, and minimize political interference. Reforming university governance aligns with global best practices and reinforces India\u2019s federal structure. States like Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and West Bengal await Presidential assent for their reform Bills, highlighting the need for equitable and timely decision-making at the national level. Conclusion: Reforming the role of Governors as Chancellors is essential for fostering transparent, accountable, and autonomous university governance. By adopting models that prioritize academic independence and minimize political entanglements, India can create an educational framework aligned with democratic principles and global standards.

Retrospective Taxation and GST - A Call for Reforms 2.0 Jan. 27, 2025 Context: January, named after the Roman god Janus, symbolizes looking back at past lessons while planning for the future. Reflecting on 2024, India\u2019s fiscal policies show a worrying return to outdated practices. Retrospective Taxation - A Harmful Habit: GST Council\u2019s decision: The 55th GST Council\u2019s recommendation of retrospective tax amendments undermines judicial decisions , including Supreme Court verdicts. Impact on businesses: Retroactive nullification of court rulings damages India's reputation for the rule of law and discourages investment. Historical lessons: Similar actions, like the Vodafone case , led to India paying international Investor\u2013state dispute settlement ( ISDS ) awards, highlighting the need to avoid such policies. The GST System - Challenges and Flaws: Revenue maximization over growth: The GST Council\u2019s narrow focus on revenue collection leads to: High tax rates suppressing demand and growth. Complex exemptions, circulars, and show-cause notices. A lack of a fair appellate system. Input tax credit issues: Denial of input tax credit for essential sectors (e.g., real estate) creates economic inefficiencies. High tax burden: Excessive GST on lease rentals, affordable housing, and infrastructure hampers economic progress. Economic Impacts of High Tax Rates: Consumption and competition: High taxes reduce consumption , while lower rates could boost demand and tax revenues. Simplified and competitive tax rates could help Indian businesses compete with Chinese imports. Sectoral challenges: Real estate: Multiple taxes increase costs, contradicting affordable housing goals. Cement: A uniform 18% GST could lower infrastructure costs. Hospitality: Standardizing GST rates for hotels and restaurants can drive growth. The Slide back to old practices: India\u2019s tax system (1950-1990) prioritized revenue over growth, leading to economic stagnation. Signs of a return to these practices are evident in: Rising imports from China ($70 billion in 2018-19 to $100 billion in 2023-24). Declining manufacturing sector contribution to GDP (<15%). Continued depreciation of the rupee. A New Policy Framework for Growth: Reforms 2.0: After 1991, it\u2019s time for the Reforms 2.0. India needs to prioritize growth maximization , with taxes as a byproduct of growth. Introduce empirical studies to evaluate tax impacts on consumption. Simplify tax structures to encourage investment and growth. Transition to a long-term fiscal policy (2025-2030) focused on a 9-10% annual growth rate. Urgency for change: The current system risks a downward spiral of low growth and high taxes, requiring immediate reforms. Conclusion - A New Year, A New Vision: Just as individuals resolve to improve themselves, nations must do the same. The need of the hour is a bold fiscal overhaul , embracing growth-focused policies and respecting the rule of law.

There are two Junior Engineers under you who have the responsibility of day-to-day inspection of the site and are reporting to you, while you are finally reporting to the Chief Engineer who heads the cell. While the construction is heading towards completion, the Junior Engineers have been regularly reporting that all construction is taking place as per design specifications. However, in one of your surprise inspections, you have noticed some serious deviations and lacunae which, in your opinion, are likely to affect the safety of the flyover. Rectification of these lacunae at this stage would require a substantial amount of demolition and rework which will cause a tangible loss to the contractor and will also delay completion. There is a lot of public pressure on the Corporation to get this construction completed because of heavy traffic congestion in the area. When you brought this matter to the notice of the Chief Engineer, he advised you that in his opinion it is not a very serious lapse and may be ignored. He advised for further expediting the project for completion in time. However, you are convinced that this was a serious matter which might affect public safety and should not be left unaddressed. What will you do in such a situation? Some of the options are given below. Evaluate the merits and demerits of each of these options and finally suggest what course of action you would like to take, giving reasons. (i) Follow the advice of the Chief Engineer and go ahead. (ii) Make an exhaustive report of the situation bringing out all facts and analysis along with your own viewpoints stated clearly and seek for written orders from the Chief Engineer. (iii) Call for explanation from the Junior Engineers and issue orders to the contractor for necessary correction within targeted time.

The local economy is largely dependent on the firecrackers industry. It has led to tangible economic development and improved standard of living in the area. So far as child labour norms for hazardous industries like firecrackers industry are concerned, International Labour Organization (ILO) has set the minimum age as 18 years. In India however this age is 14 years. The units in industrial clusters of firecrackers can be classified into registered and non-registered entities. One typical unit is household-based work. Though the law is clear on the use of child labour employment norms in registered/non-registered units, it does not include household-based works. Household-based work means children working under the supervision of their parents/relatives. To evade child labour norms, several units project themselves as household-based works but employ children from outside. Needless to say that employing children saves the costs for these units leading to higher profits to the owners. On your visit to one of the units at Sivakasi the owner takes you around the unit which has about 10-15 children below 14 years of age. The owner tells you that in his household-based unit, the children are all his relatives. You notice that several children smirk, when the owner tells you this. On deeper enquiry, you figure out that neither the owner nor the children are able to satisfactorily establish their relationship with each other.

It may cause hardship to the family members as well as risk to one\u2019s life. Why should we not be pragmatic and follow the path of least resistance, and be happy with doing whatever good we can?

They are going to be rather ineffective and are bound to get frustrated. (iii) If we become fussy about ethical considerations, will it not hamper the economic progress of our country? After all, in the present age of high competition we cannot afford to be left behind in the race of development (iv) It is understandable that we should not get involved in grossly unethical practices, but giving and accepting small gratifications and doing small favors increases everybody\u2019s motivation.

The Ministry is about to announce a mega road project for which the drawings are already in place. Sufficient care was taken by the planners to make use of the government land with the minimum land acquisition from private parties. Compensation rate for private parties was also finalized as per government rules. Care was also taken to minimize deforestation. Once the project is announced, it is expected that there will be a huge spurt in real estate prices in and around that area. Meanwhile, the Minister concerned insists that you realign the road in such a way that it comes closer to his 20 acres farmhouse. He also suggests that he would facilitate the purchase of a big plot of land in your wife name at the prevailing rate which is very nominal, in and around the proposed mega road project. He also tries to convince you by saying that there is no harm in it as he is buying the land legally. He even promises to supplement your savings in case you do not have sufficient funds to buy the land. However, by the act of realignment, a lot of agricultural lands has to be acquired, thereby causing a considerable financial burden on the government, and also the displacement of the farmers.

The pollution caused by the industrial effluents was affecting the land, water and crops in the area. It was also causing serious health problems to human beings and animals. This gave rise to a series of agitations demanding the closure of the plant. In a recent agitation thousands of people took part, creating a law and order problem necessitating stern police action. Following the public outcry, the State government ordered the closure of the factory.

His department is presently busy organizing the budgetary support to the states, four of which are due to go to the polls within the financial year. This year\u2019s annual budget had allotted Rs. 8300 crores for the National Housing Scheme (NHS), a centrally sponsored social housing scheme for the weaker sections of society. `775 crores have been drawn for the NHS till June. The Ministry of Commerce had long been pursuing a case for setting up a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in a southern state to boost exports. After two years of detailed discussions between the center and state, the Union Cabinet approved the project in August. The process was initiated to acquire the necessary land. Eighteen months ago, a leading Public Sector Unit (PSU) had projected the need for setting up a large natural gas processing plant in a northern state for the regional gas grid. The required land is already in possession of the PSU. The gas grid is an essential component of the national energy security strategy. After three rounds of global bidding, the project was allotted to an MNC, M/s XYZ Hydrocarbons. The first tranche of payment to the MNC is scheduled to be made in December. The Finance Ministry was asked for a timely allocation of an additional Rs. 6000 crores for these two developmental projects. It was decided to recommend re-appropriation of this entire amount from the NHS allocation. The file was forwarded to the Budget Department for their comments and further processing. On studying the case file, Rajesh Kumar realized that this re-appropriation may cause inordinate delay in the execution of NHS, a project much publicized in the rallies of senior politicians. Correspondingly, non-availability of finances would cause financial loss in the SEZ and national embarrassment due to delayed payment in an international project. Rajesh Kumar discussed the matter with his seniors. He was conveyed that this politically sensitive situation needs to be processed immediately. Rajesh Kumar realized that diversion of funds from the NHS could raise difficult questions for the government in the Parliament. Discuss the following with reference to this case: (a) Ethical issues involved in re-appropriation of funds from a welfare project to the developmental projects. (b) Given the need for proper utilization of public funds, discuss the options available to Rajesh Kumar.

BML had admirably progressed from producing first generation anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) to designing and producing state of the art ATGM weapon systems that would be the envy of any army. He sighed in reconciliation with his assumptions that the government would probably not alter the status quo of a ban on exports of military weaponry. To his surprise, the very next day he got a telephone call from the Director General, Ministry of Defence, asking him to discuss the modalities of increasing BML production of ATGMs as there is a possibility of exporting the same to a friendly foreign country. The Director General wanted the Chairman to discuss the details with his staff at Delhi next week. Two days later, at a press conference, the Defence Minister stated that he aims to double the current weapons export levels within five years. This would give an impetus to financing the development and manufacture of indigenous weapons in the country. He also stated that all indigenous arms manufacturing nations have a very good record in international arms trade. (a) As Chairman of BML, what are your views on the following points?

A huge multipurpose mall is under construction in your city in which a large number of daily wage earners are employed. One night, during monsoons, a big chunk of the roof collapsed causing instant death of four laborers including two minors. Many more were seriously injured requiring immediate medical attention. The mishap resulted in a big hue and cry, forcing the government to institute an inquiry. Your preliminary enquiry has revealed a series of anomalies. The material used for the construction was of poor quality. Despite the approved building plans permitting only one basement, an additional basement has been constructed. This was overlooked during the periodic inspections by the building inspector of the municipal corporation. In your enquiry, you noticed that the construction of the mall was given the green signal despite encroaching on areas earmarked for a green belt and a slip road in the Zonal Master Plan of the city. The permission to construct the mall was accorded by the previous Municipal Commissioner who is not only your senior and well known to you professionally, but also a good friend. Prima facie, the case appears to be of a widespread nexus between officials of the Municipal Corporation and the builders. Your colleagues are putting pressure on you to go slow in the enquiry. The builder, who is rich and influential, happens to be a close relative of a powerful minister in the state cabinet. The builder is persuading you to hush up the matter, promising you a fortune to do so.

It has rocky terrain that is not suitable for agriculture, though some subsistence agriculture is being done on small plots of land. The area receives adequate rainfall and has an irrigation canal flowing through it. Amria, its administrative center, is a medium-sized town. It houses a large district hospital, an Industrial Training Institute and some privately owned skill training centers. It has all the facilities of a district headquarters. A trunk railway line passes approximately 50 kilometers from Amria. Its poor connectivity is a major reason for the absence of any major industry therein. The state government offers a 10 year tax holiday as an incentive to new industry. In 2010 Anil, an industrialist, decided to take benefits to set up Amria Plastic Works (APW) in Noora village, about 20 km from Amria. While the factory was being built, Anil hired the required key labor and got them trained at the skill training centers at Amria. This act of his made the key personnel very loyal to APW. APW started production in 2011 with the labor drawn fully from Noora village. The villagers were very happy to get employment near their homes and were motivated by the key personnel to meet the production targets with high quality. APW started making large profits, a sizable portion of which was used to improve the quality of life in Noora. By 2016, Noora could boast of a greener village and a renovated village temple. Anil liaised with the local MLA to increase the frequency of the bus services to Amria. The government also opened a primary health care center and primary school at Noora in buildings constructed by APW. APW used its CSR funds to set up women\u2019s self-help groups, subsidize primary education to the village children and procure an ambulance for use by its employees and the needy. In 2019, there was a minor fire in APW. It was quickly extinguished as fire safety protocols were in place in the factory. Investigations revealed that the factory had been using electricity in excess of its authorized capacity. This was soon rectified. The next year, due to a nationwide lockdown, the requirement of production fell for four months. Anil decided that all employees would be paid regularly. He employed them to plant trees and improve the village habitat. APW had developed a reputation of high-quality production and a motivated workforce.

The pandemic has brought them into national focus. On announcement of a countrywide lockdown, a very large number of migrant workers decided to move back from their places of employment to their native villages. The non-availability of transport created its own problems. Added to this was the fear of starvation and inconvenience to their families. This caused the migrant workers to demand wages and transport facilities for returning to their villages. Their mental agony was accentuated by multiple factors such as a sudden loss of livelihood, possibility of lack of food and inability to assist in harvesting their rabi crop due to not being able to reach home in time. Reports of inadequate response of some districts in providing the essential boarding and lodging arrangements along the way multiplied their fears.

Considering his profile, he was picked up by his bosses to handle a very challenging and sensitive assignment. He was posted in a tribal dominated district notorious for illegal sand mining. Excavating sand from the river belt and transporting it through trucks and selling them in black market was rampant. This illegal sand mining mafia was operating with the support of local functionaries and tribal musclemen who in turn were bribing selected poor tribals and had kept the tribals under fear and intimidation. Sunil being a sharp and energetic officer immediately grasped the ground realities and the modus operandi followed by the mafia through their devious and dubious mechanism. On making inquiries, he gathered that some of their own office employees are hand in glove with them and have developed a close unholy nexus. Sunil initiated stringent action against them and started conducting raids on their illegal operations of movement of trucks filled with sand. The mafia got rattled as not many officers in the past had taken such strong steps against the mafia. Some of the office employees who were allegedly close to the mafia informed them that the officer is determined to clean up the mafia\u2019s illegal sand mining operations in that district and may cause them irreparable damage. The mafia turned hostile and launched a counter-offensive. The tribal musclemen and mafia started threatening him with dire consequences. His family (wife and old mother) were stalked and were under virtual surveillance and thus causing mental torture, agony and stress to all of them. The matter assumed serious proportions when a muscle man came to his office and threatened him to stop raids, etc., otherwise, his fate will not be different from some of his predecessors (ten years back one officer was killed by the mafia).

One of the students was the son of a local politician who was responsible for getting the college affiliated to the present reputed university. The second student was the son of a local businessman who has donated maximum funds for running the college. You immediately informed the management regarding this unfortunate incident.

The deadline is to complete the project in the next two years by 30 June 2021, since this project is to be inaugurated by the Chief Minister before the elections are announced in the second week of July 2021. While carrying out the surprise inspection by the inspection team, a minor crack was noticed in one of the piers of the elevated corridor possibly due to poor material used. You immediately informed the chief engineer and stopped further work. It was assessed by you that a minimum three piers of the elevated corridor have to be demolished and reconstructed. But this process will delay the project minimum by four to six months. But the chief engineer overruled the observation of the inspection team on the ground that it was a minor crack which will not in any way impact the strength and durability of the bridge. He ordered you to overlook the observation of the inspecting team and continue working with the same speed and tempo. He informed you that the minister does not want any delay as he wants the Chief Minister to inaugurate the elevated corridor before the elections are declared. Also informed you that the contractor is a distant relative of the minister and he wants him to finish the project. He also gave you a hint that your further promotion as additional chief engineer is under consideration with the ministry. However, you strongly felt that the minor crack in the pier of the elevated corridor will adversely affect the health and life of the bridge and therefore it will be very dangerous not to repair the elevated corridor.

As on May 8th, 2020, in India 56342 positive cases of corona had been reported. India with a population of more than 1.35 billion had difficulty in controlling the transmission of coronavirus among its population. Multiple strategies became necessary to handle this outbreak. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of India raised awareness about this outbreak and to take all necessary actions to control the spread of COVID-19. The Indian Government implemented a 55-day lockdown throughout the country to reduce the transmission of the virus. Schools and colleges had shifted to an alternative mode of teaching-learning-evaluation and certification. Online mode has become popular these days. India was not prepared for a sudden onslaught of such a crisis due to limited infrastructure in terms of human resource, money and other facilities needed for taking care of this situation. This disease did not spare anybody irrespective of caste, creed, religion on the one hand and \u2018have and have not\u2019 on the other.

As a part of routine transfer, he was posted to another department. He joined a new office along with five other colleagues. The head of the office was a senior officer conversant with the functioning of the office. As a part of general inquiry, Pawan gathered that his senior officer carries the reputation of being a difficult and insensitive person having his own disturbed family life. Initially, all seemed to go well. However, after some time Pawan felt that the senior officer was belittling him and at times unreasonable. Whatever suggestions given or views expressed by Pawan in the meetings were summarily rejected and the senior officer would express displeasure in the presence of others. It became a pattern of boss\u2019 style of functioning to show him in a bad light highlighting his shortcomings and humiliating publicly. It became apparent that though there were no serious work-related problems/shortcomings, the senior officer was always on one pretext or the other and would scold and shout at him. The continuous harassment and public criticism of Pawan resulted in loss of confidence, self-esteem and equanimity. Pawan realized that his relationship with his senior officer was becoming more toxic and due to this, he felt perpetually tense, anxious and stressed. His mind was occupied with negativity and caused him mental torture, anguish and agony. Eventually, it badly affected his personal and family life. He was no longer joyous, happy and content even at home. Rather without any reason he would lose his temper with his wife and other family members. The family environment was no longer pleasant and congenial. His wife who was always supportive to him also became a victim of his negativity and hostile behavior. Due to harassment and humiliation suffered by him in the office, comfort and happiness virtually vanished from his life. Thus, it damaged his physical and mental health.

But presently the company was passing through the difficult times as the sales were continuously showing a downward trend in the last two quarters. His division, which hitherto had been a major revenue contributor to the company\u2019s financial health, was now desperately trying to procure some big government order for them. But their best efforts did not yield any positive success or breakthrough. His was a professional company and his local bosses were under pressure from their London-based HO to show some positive results. In the last performance review meeting taken by the Executive Director (India Head), he was reprimanded for his poor performance. He assured them that his division is working on a special contract from the Ministry of Defence for a secret installation near Gwalior and tender is being submitted shortly. He was under extreme pressure and he was deeply perturbed. What aggravated the situation further was a warning from the top that if the deal is not clinched in favor of the company, his division might have to be closed and he may have to quit his lucrative job. There was another dimension which was causing him deep mental torture a and agony. This pertained to his personal precarious financial health. He was a single earner in the family with two school-college going children and his old ailing mother. The heavy expenditure on education and medical was causing a big strain to his monthly pay packet. Regular EMI for housing loans taken from banks was unavoidable and any default would render him liable for severe legal action. In the above backdrop, he was hoping for some miracle to happen. There was a sudden turn of events. His secretary informed that a gentleman-SubhashVerma wanted to see him as he was interested in the position of Manager which was to be filled by him in the company. He further brought to his notice that his CV has been received through the office of the Minister of Defence. During the interview of the candidate-Subhash Verma, he found him technically sound, resourceful and an experienced marketeer. He seemed to be well-conversant with tendering procedures and having a knack of follow-up and liaising in this regard. Prabhat felt that he was a better choice than the rest of the candidates who were recently interviewed by him in the last few days. Subhash Verma also indicated that he was in possession of the copies of the bid documents that the Unique Electronics Ltd. would be submitting the next day to the Defence Ministry for their tender. He offered to hand over those documents subject to his employment in the company on suitable terms and conditions. He made it clear that in the process, the Sterling Electric Ltd. could outbid their rival company and get the bid and hefty Defence Ministry order. He indicated that it will be a win-win situation for both-him and the company. Prabhat was absolutely stunned. It was a mixed feeling of shock and thrill. He was uncomfortable and perspiring. If accepted, all his problems would vanish instantly and he may be rewarded for securing the much awaited tender and thereby boosting the company\u2019s sales and financial health. He was in a fix as to the future course of action. He was wonder-struck at the guts of Subhash Verma in having surreptitiously removed his own company papers and offering to the rival company for a job. Being an experienced person,he was examining the pros and cons of the proposal/situation and he asked him to come the next day. (a) Discuss the ethical issues involved in the case.

Ramesh\u2019s mother has recently been diagnosed with cancer and has been admitted in the leading cancer hospital of the city. His two adolescent children have also got admission in one of the best public schools of the town. After settling down in his appointment as Director in the Home Department of the State, Ramesh got a confidential report through intelligence sources that illegal migrants are infiltrating in the State from the neighboring country. He decided to personally carry out surprise checks of the border posts along with his Home Department team. To his surprise, he caught red-handed two families of 12 members infiltrated with the connivance of the security personnel at the border posts. On further inquiry and investigation, it was found that after the migrants from neighboring countries infiltrate, their documentation like Aadhaar Card, Ration Card and Voter Card are also forged and they are made to settle down in a particular area of the State. Ramesh prepared the detailed and comprehensive report and submitted it to the Additional Secretary of the State. However, he was summoned by the Additional Home Secretary after a week and was instructed to withdraw the report. The Additional Home Secretary informed Ramesh that the report submitted by him has not been appreciated by the higher authorities. He further cautioned him that if he fails to withdraw the confidential report, he will not only be posted out from the prestigious appointment from the State capital but his further promotion which is due in near future will also get in jeopardy.

However, the stone mining was still prevalent in the border district of the affected State with connivance of certain corrupt forest officials and politicians. Young and dynamic SP who was recently posted in the affected district promised to himself to stop this menace. In one of his surprise checks with his team, he found a truck loaded with stone trying to escape the mining area. He tried to stop the truck but the truck driver overran the police officer, killing him on the spot and thereafter managed to flee. Police filed an FIR but no breakthrough was achieved in the case for almost three months. Ashok who was the Investigative Journalist working with leading TV channel, suo-moto started investigating the case. Within one month, Ashok got breakthrough by interacting with local people, stone mining mafia and government officials. He prepared his investigative story and presented it to the CMD of the TV channel. He exposed in his investigative report the complete nexus of the stone mafia working with the blessing of corrupt police and civil officials and politicians. The politician who was involved in the mafia was no one else but a local MLA who was considered to be very close to the Chief Minister. After going through the investigative report, the CMD advised Ashok to drop the idea of making the story public through electronic media. He informed that the local MLA was not only the relative of the owner of the TV channel but also had unofficially 20 percent share in the channel. The CMD further informed Ashok that his further promotion and hike in pay will be taken care of in addition the soft loan of `10 lakhs which he has taken from the TV channel for his son\u2019s chronic disease will be suitably adjusted if he hands over the investigative report to him.

In that region, there were a large number of small and medium industries which had been granted clearance. You learnt that these industries provide employment to many migrant workers. Most of the industrial units have got environmental clearance certificates in their possession. The environmental clearance seeks to curb industries and projects that supposedly hamper the environment and living species in the region. But in practice most of these units remain to be polluting units in several ways like air, water and soil pollution. As such, local people encountered persistent health problems. It was confirmed that the majority of the industries were violating environmental compliance. You issued notice to all the industrial units to apply for a fresh environmental clearance certificate from the competent authority. However, your action met with hostile response from a section of the industrial units, other vested interest persons and a section of the local politicians. The workers also became very hostile to you as they felt that your action would lead to the closure of these industrial units, and the resultant unemployment will lead to insecurity and uncertainty in their livelihood. Many owners of the industries approached you with the plea that you should not initiate harsh action as it would compel them to sell their units, and cause huge Financial loss, or shortage of their products in the market. These would obviously add to the sufferings of the laborers and the consumer alike. The labor union also sent you a representation requesting against the closure of the units.

The technology\u2019s proliferation has led to a growing concern over the environmental repercussions, resulting in an increase in warnings. AI models, especially those used in extensive machine learning and data processing, exhibit much greater energy consumption than conventional computer tasks, with an exponential increase.

Thus they were vulnerable and soft targets. In the review meeting taken by him with senior officers of DIG Range and above, it came to light that a new terrorist group has emerged at the global level. It has launched a massive drive to recruit young unemployed people. Special focus was to pick young people from particular communities. The said organisation seemed to have the clear objective of utilising/using them for carrying out militant activities. It was also gathered that the said (new) group is desperately trying to spread its tentacles in his state. A definite/reliable intelligence tip was received by the State CID and Cyber Cell that a large number of such unemployed youth have already been contacted by the terrorist outfit/group through social media and local communal organisations and other contacts. The need of the hour was to act swiftly and to check these elements/designs before they assume serious proportions. Discrete inquiries made by the police, through the Cyber Cell revealed that good numbers of unemployed youth are very active on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. On average, many of them were spending. 6-8 hours each day, using electronic devices/internet, etc. It also came to light that such unemployed youth were showing sympathy and endorsing messages received from certain persons, allegedly the contact persons of that global terrorist group. Their social media accounts revealed their strong affinity to such groups as many of them started forwarding anti-national tweets on their WhatsApp and Facebook, etc. It seemed that they succumbed to their ploy and started propagating secessionist ideology. Their posts were hyper-critical of the government\u2019s initiatives, policies and subscribing to extreme beliefs and promoting extremism. (a) What are the options available to Raman to tackle the above situation? (b) What measures would you suggest for strengthening the existing set-up to ensure that such groups do not succeed in penetrating and vitiating the atmosphere in the state? (c) In the above scenario, what action plan would you advise for enhancing the intelligence gathering mechanism of the police force.", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/pyqs_pwonly_yes.csv"}

With the multi-pronged strategy of the Central and State Governments especially in the last few years, the naxalite problem has been resolved to a large extent in the affected states of the country. However, there are a few pockets in certain states where the naxalite problem still persists, mainly due to involvement of foreign countries. Rohit is posted as SP (Special Operations) for the last one year, in one of the districts which is still affected by the naxalite problem. The district administration has taken a lot of developmental works in the recent past in the naxalite affected areas to win the hearts and minds of the people. Over a period of time, Rohit has established an excellent intelligence network to get the real time information regarding the movement of naxalite cadres. To instil confidence in the public and have moral ascendancy over the naxalites, a number of cordons and search operations are being conducted by the police. Rohit, who himself was leading one of the contingents, got a message through his intelligence source that about ten hard core naxalites were hiding in a particular village with sophisticated weapons. Without wasting any time, Rohit reached the target village with his team and laid out a foolproof cordon and started carrying out a systematic search. During the search, his team managed to overpower all the naxalites along with their automatic weapons. However, in the meantime, more than five hundred tribal women surrounded the village and started marching towards the target house, as they are their protectors and saviours. The situation on the ground was becoming very critical as the tribal women were extremely agitated and aggressive. Rohit tried to contact his superior officer, IG (Special Operations) of the state on the radio set and on mobile phone, but failed to do so due to poor connectivity. Rohit was in great dilemma since out of the naxalites apprehended two were not only hard core top insurgents with prize money of ten lakhs on their heads, but were also involved in a recent ambush on the security forces. However, if he did not release the naxalites, the situation could get out of control since the tribal women were aggressively charging towards them. In that case, to control the situation Rohit might have to resort to firing which may lead to valuable loss of lives of civilians and would further complicate the situation. (a) What are the options available with Rohit to cope with the situation. (b) What are the ethical dilemmas being faced by Rohit? (c) Which of the options, do you think, would be more appropriate for Rohit to adopt and why? (d) In the present situation, what are the extra precautionary measures to be taken by the police in dealing with women protesters?", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/pyqs_pwonly_yes.csv"}

The District Collector has been mobilising his subordinate officials to conserve the remaining water reserves to prevent the district from plunging into an acute drinking water crisis. Along with an awareness campaign for conserving water, strict measures have been taken for stopping the over-exploitation of ground-water. Vigilance teams have been deployed to tour the villages and find the farmers who are drawing water from deep borewells or from the river reservoir for irrigation. The farmers are agitated by such action. A delegation of farmers meets the District Collector with their issues and complains that while they are not being allowed to irrigate their crops, big industries located near the river are drawing huge amounts of water through deep borewells for their industrial processes. The farmers allege that their administration is anti-farmer and corrupt, being bribed by the industry. The district needs to placate the farmers as they are threatening to go on a prolonged protest. At the same time, the District Collector has to deal with the water crisis. The industry cannot be closed as this would result in a large number of workers being unemployed.

There is huge pressure on Dr. Srinivasan\u2019s team to expedite the trials for the drug as there is a significant market for it, and the company wants to get the first-mover advantage in the market.

Context: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has warned states against fiscal slippages , rising borrowing, and pre-election populist spending , highlighting risks to long-term financial stability. Pre-election populist spending refers to the increase in subsidies and welfare outlays mainly to attract voter support , rather than to promote sustained economic growth. Key Concerns Highlighted by RBI Rising Borrowing Costs: Yields on State Development Loans (SDLs) have risen sharply. Higher yields mean states must pay more interest , increasing the overall debt burden. Increasing Market Borrowing: States have borrowed \u20b95.23 trillion till October 2025 , which is 62% of their FY26 borrowing plan , compared to \u20b94.37 trillion in the same period last year. This indicates faster-than-expected fiscal stress . Fiscal Deficit Pressure: The combined fiscal deficit for states is expected to be 3.2% of GDP . However, analysts caution that pre-election expenditure could push this above the recommended limits , threatening fiscal stability. Pre-Election Populist Spending: During eight state elections (2023\u201325) , states spent nearly \u20b968,000 crore on short-term welfare schemes. For example, Bihar allocated 32.48% of its tax revenues to such schemes, reducing funds available for infrastructure and long-term development. What are SDLs? State Development Loans (SDLs) are bonds issued by state governments to raise funds for development expenses and fiscal deficit management. These are auctioned by the RBI and carry interest, contributing to long-term debt liabilities of states. RBI Recommendations Recommendation Purpose Productive Spending Shift funds from temporary subsidies toward capital expenditure (roads, power, irrigation) that builds future growth. Fiscal Prudence Adhere to FRBM Act targets to maintain balanced budgets and macroeconomic stability. Borrowing Strategy Spread borrowings across maturities and maintain transparent communication to lower interest costs. Fiscal Transparency Clearly report contingent liabilities and off-budget borrowings to avoid hidden debt risks. Why This Matters States account for nearly 60% of public sector capital expenditure in India. Excessive populist spending reduces funds for development , slowing growth and worsening debt sustainability. Maintaining fiscal discipline strengthens investor confidence , supports stable interest rates , and ensures inter-generational equity . Conclusion RBI\u2019s caution underscores the importance of sustainable fiscal management . While welfare spending remains essential, states must prioritize long-term developmental spending and maintain transparent and prudent financial practices to safeguard economic stability.", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/rausias_yes.csv"}

They are maintained to: Ensure exchange rate stability of the Rupee, Provide liquidity for external trade and debt payments , and Strengthen investor and global market confidence in India\u2019s economic stability. Components of Forex Reserves: Foreign Currency Assets (FCA): Securities and deposits in global currencies such as USD, Euro, Yen, etc. Gold Reserves: Physical gold and gold deposits valued at international prices. Special Drawing Rights (SDRs): Reserve assets allocated by the IMF to support global liquidity. Reserve Tranche Position: India\u2019s withdrawable contribution with the IMF for balance-of-payments needs. Significance for India Exchange Rate Stability: Enables RBI to intervene in forex markets to curb sharp rupee fluctuations. Import Cover: Current reserves can finance over 10 months of imports , enhancing economic security. Crisis Buffer: Helps India withstand global economic shocks, trade imbalances, or capital outflows. Investor Confidence: High reserves encourage greater foreign investment and reduce perceived economic risk. Portfolio Diversification: Rising gold reserves act as a hedge against fluctuations in the US dollar. Challenges Heavy RBI intervention can sometimes reduce export competitiveness by influencing rupee value. Large reserves need careful management to avoid low-return accumulation costs .

{"id": "03e8cec6-65df-4418-b504-323a0abc6fca", "text": "Poseidon Underwater Drone: Russia\u2019s Nuclear-Powered UUV. Context: According to the Russian Ministry of Defence and the Nuclear Observation Agency (NOA) , Russia has successfully tested its nuclear-powered, nuclear-armed underwater drone \u2014 Poseidon . It represents a new class of Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) capable of strategic nuclear delivery with unprecedented endurance and stealth. About Poseidon Type: Nuclear-powered, nuclear-capable Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV). Developer: Rubin Design Bureau, Russia. Objective: To deliver conventional or nuclear payloads across intercontinental distances and potentially generate radioactive tsunamis capable of destroying coastal cities and naval bases. Power Source: A miniaturized nuclear reactor , giving Poseidon virtually unlimited operational range and the ability to patrol underwater for months without surfacing. Launch Platform: Poseidon is designed to be carried and launched from special-purpose submarines such as the Belgorod (Project 09852) and Khabarovsk (Project 09851) . Technical Specifications (as reported) Parameter Details Range Practically unlimited (due to nuclear propulsion) Speed Up to 100 knots (~185 km/h) Operational Depth > 1,000 meters Length ~20 meters Diameter ~2 meters Payload Up to 2 megatons (nuclear warhead) Strategic Significance Second-Strike Capability: Poseidon enhances Russia\u2019s nuclear deterrence by ensuring a second-strike option even if land-based systems are neutralized. Stealth and Survivability: Operating at great depths and high speeds, Poseidon is difficult to detect or intercept with existing sonar or anti-submarine technologies. Psychological Deterrence: Its ability to potentially cause \u201cradioactive tsunamis\u201d along enemy coastlines adds a new dimension to nuclear deterrence, raising ethical and strategic debates globally. Global Implications Arms Control Concerns: Poseidon\u2019s introduction complicates future nuclear arms treaties , as current frameworks (like New START ) do not account for autonomous underwater nuclear systems. Strategic Stability: It may trigger an underwater arms race , with the U.S., China, and NATO nations likely to accelerate counter-drone and detection technologies. Environmental Risks: The use of nuclear propulsion raises concerns about marine contamination in the event of malfunction or accident. India\u2019s Relevance While India does not possess such a weapon, Poseidon\u2019s test underscores the growing importance of autonomous naval systems and underwater deterrence in future warfare.

India\u2019s maritime sector plays a pivotal role in its economic and strategic landscape. With 12 major ports and over 200 non-major ports along a 7,500 km coastline, the sector handles nearly 95% of India\u2019s trade by volume and 70% by value. Recognizing this significance, the government has launched two landmark roadmaps \u2014 Maritime India Vision (MIV) 2030 and Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047 \u2014 aimed at transforming India into a global maritime power. Maritime India Vision (MIV) 2030 Launched in 2021, MIV 2030 is a comprehensive national strategy to position India among the world\u2019s top 10 maritime nations by 2030. It outlines 150+ initiatives requiring investments of around \u20b93\u20133.5 lakh crore across port modernization, coastal shipping, shipbuilding, and inland waterways. The vision is guided by six key principles: challenge analysis , innovation , time-bound implementation , global benchmarking , human capital development , and Waste-to-Wealth recycling of maritime scrap and resources. MIV 2030 builds upon existing initiatives such as Sagarmala , ensuring continuity in infrastructure, connectivity, and logistics reforms. The Maritime Development Fund (MDF) ensures long-term project financing, while the Financial Assistance Scheme encourages domestic shipbuilding. Digitization is being enhanced through platforms like the Sagarmanthan portal and the National Logistics Portal (Marine) . Key Focus Areas The policy framework identifies ten thematic areas including shipbuilding, port governance, cruise tourism, inland waterways, and maritime safety. Notably, 23 National Waterways have been prioritized to promote low-cost and eco-friendly cargo movement. Additionally, the National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal, Gujarat, aims to showcase India\u2019s ancient maritime culture and trade networks. Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047 Launched in 2023 at the Global Maritime India Summit, this long-term roadmap seeks to make India a global maritime leader by 2047 , aligning with the centenary of independence. It proposes 300+ initiatives with investments of ~\u20b980 lakh crore . Key targets include: Increasing port capacity to 10,000 MTPA Positioning India among the top five shipbuilding nations Creating over 1.5 crore employment opportunities Building strong maritime skill and research clusters The strategy rests on four pillars: Port-led Development , Shipping & Shipbuilding , Seamless Logistics , and Maritime Skill Development . Growth Trends (2014\u20132025) Inland Waterway cargo grew from 18 MMT to 146 MMT (710% rise) Operational waterways increased from 3 to 29 Port capacity nearly doubled to 2,762 MMTPA Vessel turnaround time reduced from 93 hours to 48 hours Indian seafarers now form 12% of the global workforce Conclusion India\u2019s maritime transformation is not only an economic strategy but also a strategic imperative.

Context: The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) will launch India\u2019s first-ever National Household Income Survey (NHIS) in February 2026 . This landmark initiative aims to generate reliable, comprehensive, and regionally representative data on household income and its distribution across different socio-economic groups. About the National Household Income Survey (NHIS) Objective: The primary goal of the NHIS is to provide accurate income estimates and assess income inequality across rural and urban India. It will help policymakers design targeted welfare measures, strengthen fiscal planning, and evaluate the impact of government schemes on income distribution. Implementing Agency: The survey will be conducted by the National Statistics Office (NSO) under the MoSPI , marking a significant expansion of India\u2019s official statistical architecture. Coverage and Scope: Both rural and urban households will be covered. Data collection will be carried out through digitally supervised household visits to ensure transparency and minimize human error. The survey will capture income from multiple dimensions, including: Wages and salaries Self-employment Property income Pensions and remittances Welfare and social transfers Methodology: A Technical Expert Group (TEG) , chaired by Surjit S. Bhalla , will design the methodology using global best practices . This will ensure consistency with international standards used in income and inequality studies by organizations such as the World Bank and OECD . Challenges in Conducting NHIS Sensitivity Barrier: Pre-tests conducted in 2025 revealed that 95% of respondents were unwilling to disclose income details, reflecting deep-seated privacy and trust concerns. Fragmented Sources: Rural households often have multiple informal income streams , making it difficult to verify and aggregate income accurately. Non-Monetised Output: The self-consumption of farm produce and barter-based exchanges complicate valuation of non-marketed income. Data Inconsistency: Persistent under-reporting and recall bias may result in lower reported income compared to actual consumption levels. Irregular Earnings: Seasonal labourers and self-employed workers face fluctuating earnings, leading to inconsistent and incomplete data capture . Significance Will fill a critical gap in India\u2019s socio-economic data landscape, as previous surveys (like NSSO consumption surveys) only provided expenditure-based insights. Supports the measurement of income inequality (Gini coefficient) and helps track regional disparities . Enhances India\u2019s capacity to align with SDG Goal 10 \u2013 Reduced Inequalities . Facilitates evidence-based policymaking for taxation, welfare targeting, and poverty alleviation . Key Economic Context India\u2019s per capita Gross National Income (GNI) for 2024\u201325 stood at \u20b92.31 lakh (current prices) , marking an 8.7% year-on-year increase . However, this growth masks regional and class-based disparities\u2014making NHIS data crucial for accurate, equitable policy design. Conclusion The National Household Income Survey marks a transformative step towards improving India\u2019s statistical precision and policy targeting. Despite implementation challenges, it promises to bridge the long-standing gap between income and consumption data , enabling a more inclusive understanding of India\u2019s economic reality.", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/rausias_yes.csv"}

Context: The Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) has submitted a policy brief titled \u201cReconciling Conservation and Community Rights\u201d to the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEFCC) . The brief proposes a structured Policy Framework for ensuring humane, rights-based relocation and coexistence of forest-dwelling communities within India\u2019s Tiger Reserves . Background India\u2019s tiger conservation success \u2014with tiger numbers rising to over 3,000 (as per the 2022 census) \u2014owes much to strong legal frameworks such as the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 (WLPA) and the Forest Rights Act, 2006 (FRA) . However, conflicts arise when conservation goals lead to forced or poorly managed relocations of indigenous and forest-dependent communities. The proposed framework seeks to balance ecological integrity with social justice , ensuring both tiger habitats and human rights are protected. Key Recommendations from the Policy Framework 1. National Governance and Oversight National Framework: Jointly developed by MoTA and MoEFCC to standardise relocation procedures , establish timelines, and ensure accountability. Public Database: A National Database on Conservation\u2013Community Interface will track relocation cases, compensation details, and post-relocation outcomes. Independent Audits: Accredited agencies will conduct annual compliance audits under FRA 2006, WLPA 1972, and human rights norms. 2. Relocations as an Exceptional Measure Voluntary and Last Resort: Relocation must only occur with verified ecological necessity and community consent . Rights Verification: All Individual and Community Forest Rights (CFRs) must be recognised at the Gram Sabha level before relocation. Consent Safeguards: Implementation of Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) with oversight by civil society observers. 3. Co-existence as the Preferred Option Right to Remain: Communities can continue living inside traditional forest areas while exercising rights under FRA 2006. In-situ Development: Provision of essential services\u2014 healthcare, education, housing, and water \u2014to make coexistence sustainable. Shared Governance: Gram Sabha members to be included in Tiger Conservation Foundations and Eco-Development Committees . 4. Legal Safeguards and Grievance Redressal Compliance Officer: Every tiger reserve must appoint one to monitor FRA and WLPA compliance. Grievance System: A three-tier redressal mechanism (district\u2013state\u2013national) will address rights violations or compensation disputes. Legal Recourse: The SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 will apply in cases of coercion, forced eviction, or denial of rights. Challenges in Relocating Forest Dwellers Livelihood Collapse: Forest-based economies are replaced by insecure, debt-prone livelihoods. Example: 2019 study on Sahariya Adivasis (Kuno NP, MP) \u2013 over 90% fell into debt post-relocation. Compensation Deficit: The \u20b915 lakh NTCA package ignores provisions of the LARR Act, 2013 , which ensures higher and fairer compensation. FRA Coercion: Cases like Baiga communities of Achanakmar TR show relocation without granting Community Forest Rights . Health Decline: Post-relocation diets rely on PDS food , reducing nutrition diversity and increasing malnutrition (e.g., Kanha TR, MP ). Conflict Shifting: Moves from core to buffer zones increase human\u2013wildlife conflicts , as seen in Tadoba-Andhari TR, Maharashtra . Way Forward A people-centric conservation model must integrate ecological sustainability with human dignity . The proposed framework emphasizes voluntariness, transparency, and shared governance , aligning conservation with constitutional principles of justice and inclusivity .", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/rausias_yes.csv"}

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is one of the most important indicators for measuring inflation, influencing monetary policy decisions, welfare schemes, and cost-of-living adjustments. Recently, the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) has proposed a significant revision in the methodology for calculating CPI, particularly in the housing component. The aim is to make the index more representative of real living conditions across both urban and rural India. Background Currently, housing has a weight of 21.67% in the urban CPI and 10.07% at the all-India level . However, this component is derived primarily from urban rental data and, in several cases, uses the House Rent Allowance (HRA) of government employees as a proxy for rent levels. Economists have pointed out that this approach fails to capture actual rental movements in growing smaller towns and does not account for rural housing dynamics, where ownership and imputed rent patterns differ significantly. Key Proposed Changes 1. Inclusion of Rural Housing Data For the first time, the CPI housing index will incorporate rental data from rural areas . This shift is based on the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) 2023\u201324 , which includes both actual rent paid and imputed rent for owner-occupied homes. This is important because rural India reports high home-ownership but also experiences value changes in housing that must be reflected in inflation estimates. 2. Exclusion of Employer-Provided Accommodation Rent data from government or employer-provided dwellings will no longer be used. In such cases, HRA depends on administrative pay scales rather than the market rental environment. Their inclusion was leading to distorted inflation signals , particularly in metropolitan centers. 3. Monthly Rent Data Collection The present methodology collects rental data only once in six months , leading to delayed or smoothed inflation readings. Under the revised framework, rent data will be collected monthly from all selected dwellings , improving the timeliness and sensitivity of the housing index. 4. Expanded Sampling and Global Best Practices The revised framework draws on technical guidance from IMF experts , emphasizing panel-based rent tracking to maintain month-to-month comparability. This will reduce volatility and ensure a more stable and representative inflation measure. Significance of the Reform Enhances accuracy and responsiveness of CPI to real housing market changes Improves representation of small towns and rural households Strengthens economic planning and monetary policy calibration Aligns India\u2019s inflation measurement approach with global statistical standards Conclusion MoSPI\u2019s revision to the CPI housing framework marks a major step toward inclusive and evidence-based inflation measurement . By reflecting actual housing costs across diverse regions, the new methodology is expected to improve policy outcomes, welfare targeting, and the credibility of India\u2019s inflation statistics.", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/rausias_yes.csv"}

Context: Bihar, which produces nearly 90% of India\u2019s makhana (foxnut), has recently become central to the government\u2019s agricultural and rural development strategy. With rising global demand and growing recognition of makhana as a superfood , the crop holds unique economic and cultural significance, especially in the Mithilanchal region of Bihar. Economic Significance Makhana (botanical name: Euryale ferox ) is primarily cultivated in the districts of Darbhanga, Madhubani, Purnea, and Katihar , which together contribute around 80% of Bihar\u2019s production. Traditionally consumed during fasting and Ayurvedic diets, makhana has now gained mainstream popularity due to its high protein, low fat, and antioxidant-rich profile. The global makhana market, valued at USD 43.56 million in 2023 , is projected to double to USD 100 million by 2033 , driven by rising health-consciousness and snack industry diversification. This positions makhana as a high-value export crop that can generate employment and entrepreneurship in rural Bihar. Challenges in the Sector Despite its potential, several structural issues limit farmer incomes and market development: Processing and Infrastructure Gaps: Bihar lacks sufficient food processing units (FPUs) , cold-chain facilities, and export-oriented packaging centres. Large quantities of raw makhana are sold to processors in Punjab and Assam , where value addition and branding occur \u2014 leaving Bihar farmers with a low share of final profits . Weak Market Organisation: Small farmers depend on middlemen due to a lack of producer cooperatives or direct market access. The demand for Minimum Support Price (MSP) remains unresolved, emerging as a critical farmer welfare concern. Labour-Intensive and Costly Cultivation: Harvesting involves manual pond diving , shelling, and hand-roasting, making the process both time-consuming and expensive. Low Productivity Levels: Traditional cultivation methods yield only 1.7\u20131.9 tonnes/hectare , whereas improved varieties such as Swarna Vaidehi and Sabour Makhana-1 can increase yields to 3\u20133.5 tonnes/hectare with scientific practices. Read also: Foxnuts (makhana) are in demand as a \u2018super snack\u2019 National Makhana Board On 15th September , the Prime Minister launched the National Makhana Board in Purnea, Bihar , with a budget of \u20b9100 crore .

Previously, MoRTH\u2019s Transport Research Wing (TRW) collected black spot data manually through state submissions and field verification. This process delayed policy response and left the national database outdated beyond 2022. About Black Spots A black spot is defined as a 500-metre stretch on a National Highway (NH) with a high frequency of accidents. A location qualifies as a black spot if, over a three-year period, it records: Five or more accidents involving deaths or grievous injuries, or Ten or more fatalities . Between 2016 and 2022 , India identified 13,795 black spots , of which 5,036 have already been rectified through long-term engineering interventions . New Approach: Data-Driven Road Safety The 2023\u201324 black spot list will be derived from real-time e-DAR and iRAD systems , ensuring faster identification and rectification. These platforms integrate data from police FIRs, hospitals, and road engineering authorities to pinpoint exact accident locations and causes. This transition from manual to digital reporting enhances accuracy, transparency, and accountability in road safety management. Institutional Framework Nodal Body: Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) Data Source: e-DAR & iRAD digital platforms Verification & Monitoring: State Public Works Departments (PWDs) and National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) Policy Oversight: National Road Safety Council (NRSC), constituted under Section 215 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 , chaired by the Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways.

Context : Union Minister Piyush Goyal recently emphasised that India must transition from digital adoption to technological creation \u2014 aiming for deeptech-led sovereignty and reducing reliance on foreign technologies. What is Technological Sovereignty? Technological Sovereignty refers to a nation\u2019s ability to develop and deploy its own technologies using indigenous infrastructure , ensuring autonomy in data, innovation, and strategic capabilities \u2014 a cornerstone of national sovereignty in the digital age. India\u2019s Dependence on Foreign Technology Electronics: Over 65% of chips and 80% of high-end components are imported ( MeitY, 2024 ). Defence: About 60% of defence equipment depends on foreign Original Equipment Manufacturers ( SIPRI, 2023 ). Renewables & EVs: 90% of solar wafers and 70% of lithium-ion cells come from China. Pharma Inputs: 68% of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) are still imported despite PLI efforts. Consequences of Technological Dependence Economic Drain: High import bills widen the current account deficit \u2014 electronics imports exceeded $70 billion in 2024 . Innovation Deficit: India holds less than 1% of global AI patents , reflecting limited indigenous innovation. Employment Loss: Deeptech manufacturing employs less than 2% of India\u2019s tech workforce ( NASSCOM, 2023 ). Digital Sovereignty Risks: Over 75% of India\u2019s cloud infrastructure is managed by foreign firms ( IDC, 2024 ), raising concerns over data autonomy and national security. The Way Forward 1. Deeptech Push Strengthen innovation in AI, quantum computing, space tech, and semiconductors . The \u20b91 lakh crore Anusandhan Fund (2025) will accelerate deeptech R&D. 2. R&D Incentives Raise national R&D expenditure (currently <1% of GDP) and provide tax benefits to private research. Learn from Israel\u2019s Innovation Authority , which co-funds up to 50% of R&D costs . 3. Chip Independence Expand the India Semiconductor Mission (2021) with $10 billion incentives for chip design, fabrication, and assembly units. 4. Building a Skilled Pipeline Develop high-end skills in STEM , retain researchers, and strengthen global scientific collaboration. Initiatives like the VAIBHAV Summit and SERB Overseas Fellowships connect diaspora scientists with Indian research institutions. 5. Nurturing Deeptech Startups Scale up Startup Fund of Funds 2.0 to support early-stage ventures focusing on AI, robotics, and clean tech through risk capital and mentorship .

Context (TH, 2025): With the paddy harvesting season underway in Punjab, stubble burning has re-emerged as a significant environmental and public health concern. Despite a visible decline in the number of recorded fire incidents, the total burnt area remains largely unchanged , reflecting the deep-rooted structural and economic issues behind the practice. Why Do Farmers Continue to Burn Stubble? Short Cropping Window: Farmers have only 20\u201325 days between paddy harvest (late October) and wheat sowing (mid-November). This limited time forces them to resort to burning for rapid field clearing. (Punjab Agricultural University, 2024) Labour Shortage: Mechanisation and rural migration have reduced the agricultural workforce by ~45% over the past decade. (NITI Aayog, 2023) High Machinery Cost: Machines like the Happy Seeder and Super Straw Management System (SMS) cost between \u20b91.5\u20132 lakh, which remains unaffordable for smallholders even after 50\u201380% subsidy . Fragmented Landholdings: Small and fragmented farms (average size 1.9 ha in Punjab, 1.4 ha in Haryana ) make residue management uneconomical. (Agricultural Census, 2021) Weak Enforcement: While penalties are prescribed under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 , enforcement is lax due to socio-political sensitivities at the local level. Environmental and Health Impacts Stubble burning contributes up to 35\u201345% of Delhi-NCR\u2019s winter PM2.5 levels . Releases CO\u2082, CH\u2084, and N\u2082O , aggravating climate change. Causes smog, respiratory illness, and soil nutrient depletion . Way Forward In-situ Management: Promote Happy Seeder and Super SMS through Custom Hiring Centres (CHCs) under ICAR\u2019s Crop Residue Management Scheme . Ex-situ Utilisation: Divert paddy straw to biogas, paper, and biomass power plants . Under the SATAT Scheme , India aims to set up 5000 Compressed Biogas plants . Direct Incentives: Provide \u20b92000\u2013\u20b93000 per acre to farmers avoiding residue burning. Pilot programs in Sangrur and Patiala reduced fire incidents by 60% . Behavioural Change: Campaigns like \u201cNo Burn November\u201d and school-based awareness drives are essential to shift community behaviour. Digital Monitoring: Integrate MODIS, VIIRS, and Sentinel-2 satellite data with on-ground verification for real-time fire mapping. (PGIMER Chandigarh, 2025) Conclusion: While policy interventions have made progress, long-term sustainability requires a blend of economic incentives, decentralised residue utilisation, and behavioural change , making stubble management a collective environmental responsibility.", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/rausias_yes.csv"}

Context : Australia\u2019s Attorney-General has rejected a policy proposal from a think tank that sought to grant technology companies unrestricted access to copyrighted material for training Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. The government instead reaffirmed that technological innovation must not come at the cost of creators\u2019 rights. This move places Australia among a small group of nations emphasizing ethical and consent-based AI development , diverging from the U.S. \u201cfair use\u201d approach and China\u2019s \u201cdata-first\u201d model. Australia\u2019s AI Copyright Policy 1. Government\u2019s Stand: The Australian government maintains that technology should not advance \u201cat the expense of creators.\u201d It argues that unrestricted scraping of copyrighted works by AI models undermines artistic and journalistic integrity, threatening creative industries. 2. Formation of CAIRG: The Copyright and AI Reference Group (CAIRG) was established to design balanced, rights-based policies. CAIRG comprises representatives from the tech sector, creative industry, academia, and legal bodies. Its mandate is to develop national guidelines for ethical AI training and data use. 3. Proposed Legal Reform: Australia is considering introducing a mandatory paid licensing framework under the Copyright Act . This would: Require AI developers to obtain permission before using copyrighted material. Ensure fair compensation and consent for creators. Establish transparency mechanisms for datasets used in AI training. Comparative Perspective United States: Allows AI developers to use copyrighted material under the \u201cfair use\u201d doctrine, subject to certain limits. European Union: Mandates \u201copt-out\u201d consent, giving creators the right to restrict their works from AI datasets. China: Promotes open data access for AI under state supervision to accelerate innovation. Australia\u2019s approach, by contrast, emphasizes creator consent as a non-negotiable principle . Significance of the Policy Upholding Creator Rights: Ensures AI development respects intellectual property, in line with UNESCO\u2019s AI Ethics Framework (2021) . Human-Centric Innovation: Demonstrates that technological and cultural goals can coexist, reinforcing public trust in AI. Global Leadership: Positions Australia as a thought leader in rights-respecting AI governance , influencing debates in other democracies. Cultural Integrity: Protects artists, writers, and content producers from data exploitation by large tech firms, ensuring sustainable creative economies. Conclusion Australia\u2019s AI Copyright Policy exemplifies a human-centric and ethically grounded approach to digital innovation. By prioritizing consent, compensation, and creator control, the country seeks to balance AI\u2019s transformative potential with fairness and accountability \u2014 setting a precedent for democracies striving to regulate artificial intelligence responsibly.", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/rausias_yes.csv"}

Context : The United States has granted India a six-month sanctions waiver for the operation and development of Iran\u2019s Chabahar Port , effective October 29, 2025 . This move allows India to continue strategic work at the port without facing penalties under U.S. sanctions laws. Background: U.S. Sanctions on Iran The sanctions originate from the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act (IFCA), Section 1244 , targeting entities engaged in Iran\u2019s energy, shipping, shipbuilding, and port sectors . Violations could result in asset freezes, exclusion from the U.S. financial system , and business restrictions . The U.S. employs these sanctions to maintain \u201cmaximum economic pressure\u201d on Iran\u2014aiming to halt nuclear proliferation, curb Tehran\u2019s support to regional militias, and push for a stricter nuclear accord. In 2018 , the U.S. granted India a waiver recognizing Chabahar\u2019s role in Afghanistan\u2019s post-war reconstruction and as a humanitarian trade hub . However, following the Taliban takeover in 2021 and shifting geopolitical priorities, the exemption was revoked in September 2025 \u2014until this recent six-month reinstatement. Chabahar Port: India\u2019s Strategic Gateway Located in Iran\u2019s Sistan-Balochistan province , Chabahar sits on the Gulf of Oman , only 170 km west of Pakistan\u2019s Gwadar Port (operated by China under CPEC). It is Iran\u2019s only oceanic port and provides India direct access to Afghanistan, Central Asia, and Europe , bypassing Pakistan . Key Terminals: Shahid Kalantari Terminal: Developed in the 1980s for conventional cargo operations, reducing Iran\u2019s dependence on the congested Strait of Hormuz. Shahid Beheshti Terminal: Operated by India Ports Global Limited (IPGL) , it forms the backbone of India\u2019s connectivity projects\u2014enabling cargo movement to Afghanistan and Central Asia via the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) . Strategic Importance for India Connectivity & Trade: Strengthens India\u2019s trade links to Eurasia , offering a secure supply chain alternative amidst global disruptions. Regional Balancing: Counters China\u2019s Gwadar influence and enhances India\u2019s maritime and logistical presence in the region.

Civil War in Sudan Context: El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur in Sudan, witnessed a large-scale massacre after the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) seized control from the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) . The incident marks a grim escalation in Sudan\u2019s ongoing civil war. Infographic Disclaimer: Map not to scale. Background: Sudan, located in Northeast Africa and bordered by the Red Sea, is the continent\u2019s third-largest nation and the world\u2019s leading producer of gum arabic. Since April 2023, the country has been engulfed in a brutal conflict between the SAF and the RSF \u2014 paramilitary forces that once fought together during the ouster of long-time ruler Omar al-Bashir in 2019. Nature of Conflict: Rivalry for Power: The war stems from a leadership struggle between SAF chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (\u201cHemedti\u201d) over control of the state and military integration. Territorial Split: The RSF controls much of western and central Sudan, including Darfur and Kordofan, while the SAF holds the north and east, operating from Port Sudan. El Fasher Capture (Oct 2025): RSF\u2019s capture of the North Darfur capital resulted in mass killings and ethnic cleansing, effectively partitioning Sudan. Proxy Involvement: Regional powers have turned the conflict into a proxy war \u2014 with the UAE reportedly backing the RSF, and Egypt and Iran supporting the SAF. Consequences: Humanitarian Crisis: Over 24 million Sudanese face acute food insecurity; famine conditions persist in Darfur and Kordofan. Mass Displacement: More than 14 million people have been displaced, creating the world\u2019s largest internal displacement crisis. State Disintegration: The central government has collapsed, halting Sudan\u2019s fragile post-2019 democratic transition. Regional Fallout: Refugee influxes and arms trafficking have destabilised neighbouring nations such as Chad, South Sudan, and Egypt. 2. Indian Household Debt Rising Faster than Assets Context: According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Indian households are accumulating debt faster than they are generating assets, as per comparative data between FY 2019\u201320 and FY 2024\u201325. Key Findings: Debt\u2013Asset Gap: Financial liabilities have risen 102% since 2019\u201320, while asset creation has increased by only 48% . GDP Share: Household financial assets declined from 12% to 10.8% of GDP, while liabilities increased from 3.9% to 4.7% . Net Savings: India\u2019s household savings have touched a five-decade low , reflecting growing reliance on debt-driven consumption. Portfolio Trends: Mutual Fund Investments: Increased from 2.6% to 13.1% of household portfolios. Currency Holdings: Declined from 11.7% to 5.9% , indicating digital and market-linked preference. Bank Deposits: Slightly increased to 33.3% of total assets. Implications: Rising financial stress due to increasing dependence on credit. Weakening long-term financial resilience and retirement preparedness. Broader macroeconomic concerns \u2014 reduced savings mean lower domestic investment capital and higher systemic credit risk. Way Forward: Sudan\u2019s civil conflict underscores the fragility of post-revolution states and the danger of militarised governance. Simultaneously, India\u2019s rising household debt highlights the need for stronger financial literacy, savings incentives, and responsible lending policies to sustain inclusive growth.", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/rausias_yes.csv"}

Context: In a historic global first, the Republic of Maldives has implemented a Generational Tobacco Ban , making it illegal for anyone born on or after January 1, 2007 , to buy or use tobacco products. This bold step places the island nation at the forefront of the global Tobacco Endgame movement , which seeks to eradicate tobacco use altogether rather than merely control it. Key Highlights of the Policy Comprehensive Ban: Applies to both citizens and tourists born in or after 2007, prohibiting all forms of tobacco use and sale. E-Cigarette Prohibition: Extends to a total ban on import, sale, possession, and use of e-cigarettes and vaping devices across all age groups. Legislative Foundation: Enacted under the Tobacco-Free Generation (TFG) framework, aligning national law with the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) . Global Significance: The Maldives\u2019 approach echoes the \u201cTobacco Endgame\u201d vision adopted by several progressive countries, including New Zealand, Finland, the UK, Canada, Australia, and Malaysia . Understanding the Tobacco Endgame Movement The Tobacco Endgame is a public health paradigm shift from merely reducing tobacco use to eliminating it. Goal: To reduce smoking prevalence to below 5% globally within a fixed timeframe. Core Strategies: Enforcing Tobacco-Free Generation laws. Limiting nicotine content in products. Implementing \u201c sinking-lid \u201d supply caps on tobacco sales. Increasing excise duties and restricting retail availability. Participation: Several countries have initiated phased Endgame policies; however, India has yet to formally adopt a national Endgame target despite being a signatory to WHO FCTC. About the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) The WHO FCTC is a landmark global treaty adopted in 2003 (effective from 2005 ), representing the first legally binding health agreement under WHO. Objective: To protect current and future generations from tobacco\u2019s health, social, environmental, and economic harms. India\u2019s Role: India ratified the FCTC in 2004 , committing to implement evidence-based tobacco control measures. Supplementary Protocol: The 2012 Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products strengthens global tracking systems to curb smuggling. Major Provisions under WHO FCTC Demand Reduction: Imposing higher taxes (Article 6), graphic health warnings (Article 11), and banning advertising (Article 13). Protection from Second-hand Smoke: Ensuring smoke-free workplaces and public transport (Article 8). Trade and Access Regulation: Preventing sales to minors and tackling illicit trade (Articles 15\u201316). Public Health Safeguards: Shielding health policies from tobacco industry interference (Article 5.3). Conclusion The Maldives\u2019 Generational Tobacco Ban marks a turning point in global health governance, signalling the beginning of a post-tobacco era.

{"id": "1468bdd8-f8dc-4978-8be8-d7bde8ea711e", "text": "SC Affirms Arrest Must Be Communicated in a Language Understood by the Arrestee. Context : The Supreme Court of India has ruled that an arrest will be deemed illegal if the written grounds of arrest are not provided in a language understood by the person being arrested. This extends the earlier protection \u2014 which applied only to arrests under special laws like the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) \u2014 to all arrests , including those made under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) or the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) . Background and Constitutional Basis The judgment draws upon the fundamental rights enshrined in: Article 22(1): Requires that any person arrested must be informed \u201cas soon as may be\u201d of the grounds for arrest and has the right to consult a legal practitioner of their choice. Article 21: Protects life and personal liberty, implying that liberty cannot be curtailed except through a fair, just, and reasonable procedure established by law. The Court clarified that these provisions must be read together to ensure meaningful protection of the arrestee\u2019s rights. Supreme Court\u2019s Key Observations Right to Know: The person being arrested has a constitutional right to be informed of the specific reasons and charges against them. Language of Communication: Merely reading out the grounds or handing over documents in an unfamiliar language does not satisfy the constitutional mandate. Written Clarity: The grounds must be given in writing and in a language the person can read or comprehend , enabling them to seek legal counsel or apply for bail effectively. Procedural Fairness: Failure to comply renders the arrest illegal and liable to be struck down. Significance of the Ruling Uniform Safeguard: Extends protection to all types of arrests, ensuring parity between special and general laws. Empowerment of Citizens: Safeguards linguistic and educationally disadvantaged groups. Administrative Accountability: Compels police and investigating agencies to adhere to due process, reducing arbitrary arrests. Reinforcement of Rule of Law: Emphasises that liberty can only be curtailed through transparent and comprehensible procedure.

Context : India\u2019s policy focus is gradually shifting from ensuring food security to achieving nutritional security . This transition reflects the need to address chronic malnutrition, rising non-communicable diseases, and environmental pressures, through the promotion of functional foods and smart proteins . Functional Foods and Smart Proteins Functional Foods: Nutrient-enriched foods offering added health benefits, such as zinc-fortified rice (IIRR, Hyderabad) and iron pearl millet (ICRISAT). Smart Proteins: Alternative proteins produced via plant-based, fermentation-derived, or cultivated meat technologies. Start-ups like GoodDot and Blue Tribe Foods are pioneering plant-based products; Zydus LifeSciences has entered fermentation protein R&D. Why India Needs Nutritional Reform Persistent Malnutrition: 35.5% of children are stunted, 19% wasted (NFHS-5). Protein Deficit: Daily average intake (~47 g) below FAO\u2019s 60 g norm. Urban\u2013Rural Divide: Urban diets contain 25\u201330% more protein (NITI Aayog, 2023). Health Concerns: India has 77 million diabetics and 25 million obese adults (IDF 2023; WHO 2024). Environmental Challenge: Livestock contributes 18\u201320% of GHG emissions; smart proteins can reduce emissions by 90%. Economic Opportunity: Global alternative protein market may reach $240 billion by 2030. Challenges Regulatory Vacuum: No FSSAI standards yet for cultivated or fermentation-based foods. Public Perception: Only 28% Indians trust lab-made foods (NCAER 2024). Infrastructure Deficit: Fewer than 15 large fermentation plants in India (DBT 2024). Affordability: Functional foods cost 20\u201330% more. Skill Gap: Less than 10% of food-science graduates specialise in nutritional biotechnology. Way Forward National Nutrition Innovation Policy: Integrate DBT, FSSAI & MoHFW to regulate and promote functional foods, similar to Japan\u2019s FOSHU model. FSSAI Framework: Define standards and safety testing for smart proteins. Public\u2013Private Partnerships: Expand BIRAC and NITI Aayog incubators for R&D. Farmer Inclusion: Incentivise bio-fortified crops via MSP and procurement. Awareness & Education: Include nutrition literacy in school curricula. Skill Development: Establish nutritional biotechnology programs in agricultural universities.

{"id": "f009d54b-4e52-4bd8-8f4c-dd48e4b47033", "text": "Soil Organic Carbon: The Foundation of Soil Health. Context : A recent ICAR study has found that climate change and unbalanced fertiliser use are accelerating the decline of Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) in India\u2019s farmlands. SOC is vital for soil fertility, water retention, and carbon sequestration \u2014 making it central to both food security and climate resilience. Key Findings of the ICAR Study SOC levels increase with elevation and decline with temperature , explaining higher carbon retention in hilly regions compared to plains. Haryana, Punjab, and western Uttar Pradesh show the highest decline due to overuse of urea and phosphorus-based fertilisers. Low SOC is directly linked to micronutrient deficiency and declining crop yields. Understanding Soil Organic Carbon SOC is the carbon component of soil organic matter , accounting for 50\u201360% of its weight. Healthy soils contain 1\u20136% SOC , derived from decomposed plants, roots, and microbes. SOC is the key determinant of soil fertility , microbial activity , and moisture retention . Determinants of SOC Temperature: Cooler regions retain more carbon; warmer climates accelerate decomposition. Rainfall: Moderate rainfall aids vegetation growth; arid zones lose carbon through erosion. Soil Texture: Clay soils preserve carbon better than sandy soils. Vegetation Type: Grasslands and forests differ in carbon storage patterns. Topography: Slopes lose SOC due to erosion, while valleys accumulate it. Benefits of High SOC Improves soil structure and resistance to erosion . Enhances nutrient availability and microbial balance . Increases water retention and irrigation efficiency . Acts as a carbon sink , mitigating climate change. Reduces dependence on chemical fertilisers. Factors Reducing SOC Intensive tillage and residue burning. Overuse of chemical fertilisers. Deforestation and land-use change. Warming temperatures and soil erosion. Way Forward Promote organic manures, composting, and biochar . Encourage no-till and cover cropping practices. Introduce carbon farming incentives and carbon credit markets. Develop soil carbon monitoring systems under ICAR\u2013NBSS&LUP. Integrate SOC management into National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) . Conclusion Soil Organic Carbon is the lifeline of Indian agriculture.

{"id": "731b5c59-afb3-4692-b2fd-79f0f479ff07", "text": "Nine Years After Demonetisation: Lessons and Realities. Context : Nine years after the 2016 demonetisation drive, police in Ghaziabad uncovered a fraud racket offering to exchange old \u20b9500 and \u20b91,000 notes \u2014 indicating that a small underground market for demonetised currency persists. The episode revives debate on whether the policy achieved its intended economic outcomes. Background On 8 November 2016 , the Government of India announced demonetisation of \u20b9500 and \u20b91,000 currency notes, which constituted 86% of total currency in circulation , citing objectives such as: Curbing black money and counterfeit currency Promoting digital payments Strengthening formalisation of the economy Key Data and Trends Currency with the Public: Fell sharply from \u20b917.97 lakh crore (Nov 2016) to \u20b97.8 lakh crore (Jan 2017). Current Level: \u20b937.29 lakh crore (as of Oct 2025, RBI data) \u2014 more than double pre-demonetisation levels. Currency-to-GDP Ratio: Pre-demonetisation (2016\u201317): 8.7% Pandemic peak (2020\u201321): 14.5% 2025: 11.1% , still higher than the U.S. (7.9%) or China (9.5%). Digital Payments: UPI transactions grew at 49% CAGR (FY23\u2013FY25), with monthly volumes exceeding \u20b920 lakh crore. Analysis Mixed Success: While demonetisation catalysed digital payment adoption, cash usage remains deeply rooted, especially in the informal sector. Temporary Disruption: Short-term liquidity shocks impacted MSMEs, agriculture, and the unorganised sector. Informal Economy: About 80\u201385% of India\u2019s employment is still informal and cash-dependent. Tax Base Expansion: Direct tax returns grew from 4.9 crore (2016\u201317) to 8.9 crore (2024\u201325), suggesting some formalisation effect. Counterfeit Currency: RBI data shows fake note detection decreased by 31% between 2016 and 2024. Structural Implications Digital Ecosystem: Strengthened through UPI, Aadhaar, and Jan Dhan accounts. Behavioural Change: Increased trust in digital finance, though cash continues as a safety asset. Monetary Stability: Currency-to-GDP ratio declining implies faster GDP growth vis-\u00e0-vis cash expansion. Future Challenge: Balancing inclusion with cash-independent growth. Conclusion Demonetisation\u2019s legacy is complex \u2014 it accelerated India\u2019s digital transformation but failed to permanently reduce cash dependency. The policy\u2019s long-term impact lies less in cash withdrawal and more in shaping a hybrid economy combining cash resilience with digital innovation.", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/rausias_yes.csv"}

{"id": "517dac26-7756-42cf-90c1-4c7c6e840b0e", "text": "Quality Control Orders (QCOs): Balancing Standards, Trade, and Industrial Competitiveness. Context : A recent NITI Aayog report has raised significant concerns about the Government of India\u2019s expanding use of Quality Control Orders (QCOs) across numerous sectors. While intended to enhance product quality, consumer safety, and manufacturing standards, the aggressive rollout of QCOs is generating unintended consequences for trade, industry productivity, and particularly MSMEs . QCOs are issued under the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) Act , making BIS certification mandatory for the manufacturing, import, or sale of specified products. Over the past four years, ministries have increasingly relied on QCOs for imports reduction, quality enhancement, and alignment with India\u2019s manufacturing ambitions. However, NITI Aayog\u2019s analysis shows that without adequate capacity, alignment with global norms, or domestic supply readiness, QCOs may create supply disruption , cost escalation , and loss of export competitiveness . What Are Quality Control Orders (QCOs)? QCOs are legally binding directives issued by ministries that require products or components to comply with BIS standards. Purpose of QCOs Protect consumer safety Improve product reliability Encourage manufacturing formalisation Reduce low-quality imports Ensure global consistency of Indian products QCOs have been introduced across sectors like steel, chemicals, electronics, textiles, toys, footwear, and food products. Key Findings of the NITI Aayog Report 1. Disproportionate Focus on Raw Materials Most QCOs target raw materials and intermediate goods , not finished products. This creates vulnerabilities because: Many intermediates are not manufactured domestically at required scale or quality Domestic firms rely on imported intermediates for global supply chains Domestic shortages lead to price spikes 2. Standards Not Aligned With Global Norms NITI Aayog found that several Indian standards differ significantly from: ISO norms ASTM international benchmarks EU or US industry regulations This non-alignment makes compliance costly, reduces interoperability, and limits India\u2019s export competitiveness. 3. Testing Infrastructure is Inadequate India has limited BIS-accredited labs , causing: Long waiting periods Higher compliance costs Slower production cycles Delayed imports and manufacturing bottlenecks For SMEs dependent on just-in-time supply chains, such delays can be existential. Impact on Imports and Exports According to research by the Centre for Social and Economic Progress (CSEP) : Impact on Imports Imports fall by 13% in the first year of a QCO Long-term decline reaches ~24% The steepest decline is in intermediate goods like steel, yarn, fibres \u2014 up to 30% drop While this may seem beneficial for import substitution, shortages raise domestic prices and reduce industry competitiveness. Impact on Exports Exports initially rise 10.6% due to upgraded quality But drop sharply by 12.8% in the second year , due to: Higher input costs Delays in certification Misalignment with global standards Reduced flexibility for exporters Thus, long-term export gains remain limited. Impact on Downstream Industries Sectors experiencing the harshest impact: Footwear Electronics Apparel Auto components SMEs in textile clusters Why? Many intermediate components required by these industries are not produced domestically . QCO-induced shortages make raw materials costlier \u2014 polyester yarn, fibres, and certain steel grades now cost 15\u201330% above global prices . Higher input costs reduce: Price competitiveness Design flexibility Market access In labour-intensive sectors, this undermines employment generation. Impact on MSMEs MSMEs are the worst affected due to: Certification fees Repeated inspections Factory audits Small production lots Limited working capital QCO compliance typically costs \u20b910,000\u2013\u20b915,000 per consignment , with approval cycles stretching into months. Large firms can internalise such costs, but MSMEs operate on thin margins. Moreover, only SEZ exporters are exempt \u2014 domestic tariff-area MSMEs cannot bypass QCOs even for export-linked inputs. This significantly reduces MSMEs\u2019 ability to compete both domestically and internationally. Governance and Policy Challenges Overlapping Regulations QCOs often overlap with: FSSAI norms Environmental safety rules PLI scheme conditions Customs standards Lack of Consultation Industry bodies argue that consultation periods for draft QCOs are short, and concerns are not fully incorporated. Non-tariff Barrier Accusations Major trading partners have raised concerns that India\u2019s QCOs act as barriers to trade , risking retaliation. Way Forward 1. Prioritise Finished Goods Over Intermediates Target QCOs at finished goods where consumer safety matters most, not at intermediate products essential for manufacturing. 2. Expand Accredited Testing Capacity Establish more BIS-accredited laboratories in tier-2 and tier-3 clusters.

Context : In November 2025, China imposed export controls on seven rare earth elements (REEs) , citing national security, supply-chain protection, and non-proliferation concerns. This move has revived global anxieties about Beijing\u2019s near-monopoly over the rare earth supply chain and triggered fresh debates on critical mineral security , strategic vulnerabilities, and the reshaping of global technological competition. China\u2019s decision comes at a time when countries worldwide are accelerating transitions to clean energy , electric mobility , and advanced defence manufacturing , all of which depend heavily on REEs. The restrictions will significantly influence geopolitics, global markets, and India\u2019s quest for supply chain resilience. Understanding Rare Earth Elements Rare earth elements comprise 17 metallic elements , including neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, terbium, and yttrium. Although not geologically rare, they are difficult to extract and refine, making supply chains complex and environmentally taxing. Key Uses Defence : Missile guidance systems, lasers, radar components, jet engines. Electronics : Smartphones, fibre optics, computer chips, displays. Clean Energy : Strong permanent magnets for wind turbines, solar inverters, EV batteries. Healthcare : MRI equipment and diagnostic devices. China\u2019s Dominance According to USGS 2024 : China accounts for 70% of global mining 85\u201395% of global refining and processing capacity Controls most magnet manufacturing , the most value-added stage. China\u2019s control over midstream and downstream processing creates a structural dependency that few countries have been able to bypass. India\u2019s Position India has the fifth-largest REE reserves , mainly in coastal monazite sands in Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh. However, India contributes less than 2% of global rare earth output due to: Limited processing technology Environmental restrictions Low value-addition capability Monopoly of public sector mining agencies Impacts of China\u2019s Export Restrictions 1. Global Supply Shock Markets reacted sharply: Dysprosium prices projected to reach $300/kg Neodymium magnet prices already up 12\u201318% in spot trading High-tech manufacturing firms triggered emergency procurement This resembles the 2010 episode when China cut exports to Japan, causing global prices to skyrocket. 2. Strategic Vulnerability for Defence and High-Tech Sectors REEs are central to military capabilities. The export curbs may: Disrupt Western missile and radar supply chains Delay F-35 production and similar aerospace programmes Create bottlenecks in EV and renewable energy expansion The US and EU have labelled the situation a national security challenge . 3. Acceleration of Global Diversification Efforts China\u2019s move is accelerating rare earth diversification globally: Japan reduced its dependence on China from 90% (2010) to 60% (2023) through investments in Australian projects. United States revived domestic production under the Mineral Security Partnership (MSP) . Australia, Canada, and Vietnam are exploring joint refining and magnet-making clusters. 4. Implications for India India has joined global efforts to diversify critical minerals supply through: KABIL (Khanij Bidesh India Ltd.) , securing five lithium blocks in Argentina New rare earth exploration in Odisha and Kerala Potential refining tie-ups with Japan, Australia, and the US However, India must improve both processing capacity and regulatory efficiency to avoid remaining a raw material exporter. Way Forward for India 1. Global Collaboration India should deepen cooperation through: India\u2013Australia Critical Minerals Alliance QUAD Rare Earth Working Group MSP-led international supply chain partnerships This offers access to refining technology, investment, and secure long-term supplies. 2. Sustainable and Responsible Mining India must adopt ESG-focused mining standards through the UNEP Global Mineral Governance Framework . Key reforms include: Transparent mining leases Stringent waste and radiation safety norms Rehabilitation plans for mined-out areas This will ensure community support and global investor confidence. 3. Recycling and Substitution Urban mining and recycling can meet a significant share of REE demand: Recovery from e-waste Substitution using ferrite magnets where feasible Incentives for recycling startups Japan recovers >50% of rare earth magnets from end-of-life electronics \u2014 a model India can replicate. 4. Strategic Stockpiling India requires a National Critical Minerals Reserve , similar to Japan\u2019s JOGMEC model , which: Stockpiles critical minerals Invests in mining abroad Supports recycling industries This helps protect domestic industries during global supply shocks. Conclusion China\u2019s rare earth export restrictions demonstrate how minerals have become tools of global geopolitics.

This shift reduces India\u2019s dependence on Middle Eastern pricing mechanisms and allows greater price transparency . 3. Strategic Value Enhances energy security by diversifying supply sources beyond West Asia. Strengthens the India\u2013US strategic partnership , complementing cooperation on critical minerals, LNG, technology, and defence. Provides a hedge against geopolitical disruptions in the Gulf region. India\u2019s LPG Landscape 1. Global Ranking India is the second-largest LPG consumer worldwide (32 MMT annual demand), after China. 2. Sectoral Consumption Domestic kitchens: ~90% of demand Commercial & Industrial: Hotels, eateries, industries Automotive: Auto-LPG vehicles 3. Import Dependence India imports 60%+ of its LPG needs, mainly from: UAE Saudi Arabia Qatar Kuwait The US deal reduces over-reliance on West Asia. 4. PMUY \u2013 Social Impact The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) provides deposit-free LPG connections to low-income women and targeted subsidies for up to 9 refills annually , making LPG a central pillar of India\u2019s clean energy transition. About Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Composition: Primarily propane (C\u2083H\u2088) and butane (C\u2084H\u2081\u2080) . State of Matter: Gas at normal temperature & pressure. Converts to liquid under moderate pressure or cooling \u2192 enabling efficient storage & transport. Volume Ratio: Liquid LPG occupies 1/250th of its gaseous volume. Safety: Naturally odourless; ethyl mercaptan is added for leak detection. Risk: LPG vapour is heavier than air and collects at low points, increasing explosion risk. Global Producers: Largest Producer: United States Other major producers: Saudi Arabia, China Top Exporters: United States & Qatar Conclusion India\u2019s first-ever LPG deal with the US marks a major milestone in its energy diplomacy. By shifting to the Mont Belvieu benchmark and reducing dependence on West Asian suppliers, India strengthens its energy security, supply resilience, and geopolitical leverage , while deepening its strategic partnership with the United States.", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/rausias_yes.csv"}

Context : The Chennai Port Authority has launched the procurement process for its first green tug under the Green Tug Transition Programme (GTTP) \u2014a major national initiative to decarbonise India\u2019s port operations. The move marks a significant step toward the adoption of cleaner, non-fossil-fuel propulsion systems in India\u2019s maritime sector. What is a Green Tug? A tugboat is a compact, high-power vessel used to push or pull large ships for docking, undocking, and manoeuvring inside ports. A battery-electric tug (e-tug) achieves 100% elimination of nitrogen and carbon emissions. Hybrid green tugs can reduce emissions by 25%\u201335% , offering an intermediate transition option before full electrification. The Chennai Port\u2019s proposed tug will use battery-electric propulsion , with built-in flexibility for future upgrades to methanol or green hydrogen systems. About the Green Tug Transition Programme (GTTP) The GTTP is an initiative of the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways (MoPSW) aimed at replacing diesel tugs with green, non-fossil-fuel propulsion systems . Key Features 1. Policy Alignment GTTP supports multiple national maritime and climate strategies: Panch Karma Sankalp Maritime India Vision (MIV) 2030 Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047 India\u2019s Net-Zero Target (2070) 2. Nodal Agency The programme is led by the National Centre of Excellence in Green Port & Shipping (NCoEGPS) . 3. Technology Pathway Transition will occur in stages: Battery-electric tugs Hybrid diesel-electric tugs Methanol-based propulsion Green hydrogen fuel-cell systems 4. Implementation Roadmap Phase 1 (2024\u20132027): Four major ports must procure at least two green tugs each . Phase 2 (2027\u20132030): At least 50% of tug fleets in pilot ports must shift to green technology. Mandates: All new tugs after 2033 must comply with GTTP standards. All tugs at major ports must be 100% green by 2040 . Significance Supports the UN Sustainable Development Goal 14 (Life Below Water).

Context : The Government of India recently hosted the Co-Op Kumbh 2025 , an international conference held in New Delhi to mark the United Nations\u2019 International Year of Cooperatives (IYC) 2025 . Organised by the Ministry of Cooperation , the event focused on strengthening and modernising India\u2019s Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) \u2014a sector that plays a pivotal financial role in urban and semi-urban communities, yet has historically struggled with governance, technology adoption, capital adequacy, and regulatory compliance. The conference brought together policymakers, global cooperative leaders, financial regulators, and academic experts to discuss pathways for transforming UCBs into tech-enabled, transparent, and inclusive grassroots financial institutions. Significance of Cooperative Kumbh 2025 The Cooperative Kumbh is more than an event; it represents a renewed effort to revitalise India\u2019s cooperative movement. UCBs serve millions of small borrowers, self-employed individuals, micro-businesses, street vendors, and low-income households. However, in recent decades, the sector\u2019s growth has slowed due to governance challenges, dual oversight complexities, limited digital infrastructure, and inability to compete with commercial banks and fintech platforms. The 2025 conference aimed to reposition UCBs as strong community-based banking entities capable of serving India\u2019s rapidly urbanising population. Key Outcomes: The Delhi Declaration 2025 The most significant achievement of the conference was the adoption of the Delhi Declaration 2025 , a strategic blueprint for the future of UCB reforms and expansion. The declaration highlights the need for improved governance standards, technology integration, stronger regulatory coordination, and enhanced financial inclusion through urban cooperatives. It acknowledges that while cooperatives are inherently community-centric, they require modern systems and professional management to remain viable in a competitive financial ecosystem. One of the most ambitious commitments in the declaration is the plan to establish at least one Urban Cooperative Bank in every Indian city with a population above two lakh within the next five years . This expansion intends to bridge financial access gaps in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, especially for informal workers and micro-enterprises who remain underserved by mainstream commercial banks. Digital Transformation: Sahkar Digi-Pay and Sahkar Digi-Loan A major highlight of the Cooperative Kumbh was the launch of two nationwide digital platforms\u2014 Sahkar Digi-Pay and Sahkar Digi-Loan . These platforms represent a transformative step in integrating UCBs into India\u2019s rapidly expanding digital financial ecosystem by enabling online payment systems, digital lending, automated credit assessment, and real-time transaction tracking. The introduction of such systems also reduces operational risks, enhances transparency, and allows cooperative banks to compete with fintech innovations. Small UCBs, which lacked digital capacity due to financial or technical constraints, can now access centralised, government-supported digital infrastructure. Understanding Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) UCBs are financial institutions owned by members of a cooperative society. They operate primarily in urban and semi-urban areas and serve customers who often remain excluded from mainstream banks. Their legal foundation lies in the State Cooperative Societies Acts or the Multi-State Cooperative Societies Act , depending on their area of operation. Unlike commercial banks, UCBs are governed through a dual regulatory framework , making them unique within India\u2019s financial system. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) oversees prudential norms, banking operations, capital adequacy, licensing, and risk management. The Registrar of Cooperative Societies (RCS) \u2014under state or central government\u2014oversees registration, elections, audits, and administrative matters. This dual structure provides UCBs with autonomy and flexibility but also contributes to operational delays, regulatory overlaps, and governance vulnerabilities. Relevance of the Cooperative Sector Today The cooperative movement has been central to India\u2019s socio-economic development since the early 20th century. Today, with the emergence of digital finance, UCBs face both opportunities and challenges. They are well-positioned to serve the \u201cmissing middle\u201d of India\u2019s economy\u2014micro and small entrepreneurs who are too big for microfinance but too small for commercial banks. However, to fulfil this role, they must undergo structural and technological transformation. The Cooperative Kumbh 2025 emphasises the need to professionalise UCB management through training, improved credit appraisal systems, better cyber-security practices, and adoption of global-level cooperative governance models.

Context : The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has launched the Dumpsite Remediation Accelerator Programme (DRAP) under the Swachh Bharat Mission\u2013Urban 2.0 (SBM-U 2.0) . The programme aims to fast-track the remediation of legacy waste dumpsites , aligning with India\u2019s vision of \u2018Lakshya Zero Dumpsites\u2019 and the broader national developmental agenda of Viksit Bharat 2047 . Legacy waste dumpsites represent one of the largest urban environmental and public-health challenges. They release methane, contaminate groundwater, attract disease vectors, and occupy scarce urban land. DRAP aims to address these issues systematically through scientific remediation, institutional strengthening, financing, and technological integration. Current Status of Dumpsite Remediation in India Scale of Legacy Waste According to MoHUA: India has 1,428 active legacy dumpsites Holding ~23 crore metric tonnes (MT) of waste 80% of this waste is concentrated in 214 high-impact dumpsites across 202 major Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) Progress Achieved So Far 1,048 dumpsites have already undergone remediation 14.33 crore MT of waste processed through biomining and bioremediation 7,580 acres of valuable urban land reclaimed \u2014 roughly 50% of the total remediable land India now ranks among the fastest countries globally in landfill reclamation scale Financial Support Centre offers \u20b9550 per tonne for legacy waste remediation \u20b94,181 crore of Central Financial Assistance (CFA) sanctioned Total project cost: \u20b910,228 crore across all states and UTs Additional support through the 15th Finance Commission grants for sanitation Objectives and Features of DRAP 1. Accelerated Remediation Model DRAP establishes a fast-track approach for: Biomining Bioremediation Scientific capping Real-time monitoring Its primary goal is to complete all legacy waste remediation by 2026 , ahead of urban population growth pressures. 2. Urban Land Reclamation and Reuse Reclaimed land will be repurposed for: Urban forests Green buffers Parks and public spaces Utility corridors Solar parks This reduces the need for fresh land acquisition. 3. Reduction of Urban Pollution Remediation aims to: Lower landfill methane emissions Prevent groundwater contamination through leachate Reduce fire hazards at dump sites Improve local air quality 4. Institutional Strengthening MoHUA has set up the SBM Knowledge Management Unit (KMU) at the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA) to: Build ULB capacities Standardise biomining protocols Facilitate peer-learning and best practices Develop training modules for municipal officials 5. Financing through Private Sector Participation HUDCO has launched the Urban Invest Window (UiWIN) to: Mobilise private investment Enable PPP-based remediation projects Support green infrastructure and circular economy initiatives Challenges in Dumpsite Remediation Despite progress, several bottlenecks remain: 1. Technical Capacity Gaps Only 30% of cities currently have functional waste treatment facilities (CPCB 2024). Many ULBs lack trained staff, biomining contractors, and scientific landfill management experience. 2. Funding and Project Cost Gaps Achieving 100% remediation requires investments much higher than available CFAs. States must mobilise their own capital and attract private players \u2014 often a challenge for smaller municipalities. 3. New Waste Accumulation 60% segregation at source (CPCB 2024) means unsegregated waste still reaches landfills daily. Without fresh waste diversion, legacy dumps could reappear. 4. Regulatory Compliance Only 68% of ULBs have notified by-laws under the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 Less than 45% have achieved complete source segregation This weakens enforcement and slows remediation. 5. Data and Monitoring Issues Only 35% of ULBs submit timely progress data Delays in dashboard reporting slow the release of CFA funds Weak digital tracking systems prevent accountability Way Forward 1. Integrated Waste Governance States should establish Urban Waste Management Cells to coordinate: Recycling policies Remediation work Waste-to-energy integration Maharashtra\u2019s State Swachh Mission model is a good template. 2. Promote Circular Economy Models Leverage UiWIN to attract private investment in: Plastics recycling Bio-CNG plants Waste-to-energy Composting clusters Indore\u2019s model of 100% landfill-free operations can be replicated. 3. Technology Integration MoHUA should create a National Digital Dashboard mapping: Dumpsite remediation progress Methane reduction estimates Land reuse potential Japan\u2019s Smart Waste Portal can be a benchmark. 4. Scientific Land Reuse Reclaimed land must follow MoEFCC\u2019s 2022 guidelines , enabling: Urban forests Solar energy installations Logistics parks Affordable housing 5.

Context : The United States has imposed sharp tariff hikes on selected Indian products, triggering a decline in bilateral trade and amplifying short-term economic volatility. Beginning August 2025 , the US levied a 50% tariff on designated Indian goods, consisting of: 25% penalty tariff linked to India\u2019s discounted purchases of Russian crude oil, and An additional 25% import duty across sensitive categories. This marks one of the most significant tariff escalations in recent India\u2013US trade relations. Major Impacts of the Tariffs 1. Export Decline India\u2019s outbound trade registered a sharp contraction: October exports \u2193 9% , following A deeper 12% fall in September , leading to A cumulative 11.8% decline in goods exports. 2. Record Trade Deficit India\u2019s trade deficit widened to $41.68 billion in October , the highest on record , driven by: Higher imports of gold , Lower demand for Indian goods in the US market. 3. Bilateral Trade Surplus Shrinks India\u2019s long-standing trade surplus with the US fell by 54% , reducing a key buffer in India\u2019s external trade position. 4. Sectoral Stress Indian labour-intensive exporters faced steep price disadvantages compared to ASEAN and Chinese competitors. Engineering goods: \u2193 ~16% Textiles & apparel: \u2193 8.34% Gems & jewellery: \u2193 25% 5. Resilient Sectors Despite overall contraction, two sectors showed robust performance: Electronics: Exports increased 25% , driven by smartphone and semiconductor-linked production. Pharmaceuticals: Continued stable double-digit growth due to strong US generics demand. Government Support Measures India has activated a combination of fiscal, credit, and regulatory interventions to stabilise exports: 1. Export Promotion Mission (EPM) The Cabinet approved a \u20b925,060-crore scheme (FY 2025\u201330) to strengthen logistics, standards, branding, and global market access. 2. Credit Guarantee Scheme for Exporters (CGSE) A \u20b920,000-crore scheme to provide collateral-free credit , easing financial strain on MSME exporters. 3. RBI Liquidity Relief The Reserve Bank of India announced a four-month moratorium on principal and interest payments for affected exporters, ensuring short-term liquidity. 4. QCO Rollback To reduce compliance costs and prevent supply bottlenecks, the government rolled back Quality Control Orders on key chemical intermediates. Conclusion The US tariff measures have caused immediate pressure on India\u2019s export competitiveness and widened the trade deficit. However, India\u2019s policy response\u2014spanning credit support, export promotion, easing of compliance norms, and sector-specific interventions\u2014aims to cushion the economy in the short run. Over the long term, India must diversify markets , enhance high-value manufacturing , and strengthen resilient supply chains to withstand global tariff shocks.", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/rausias_yes.csv"}

Context: The Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and BIRAC have placed Precision Biotherapeutics as a national priority under the BioE\u00b3 Policy (Bioeconomy for Emerging India Ecosystem) . This signals India\u2019s commitment to building capabilities in personalised, gene-based, targeted and molecular therapies \u2014 the future of advanced medicine. What are Precision Biotherapeutics? Precision biotherapeutics are personalised, molecular-profile-based medical interventions designed using genomics, proteomics, bioinformatics, gene editing, RNA technologies, engineered cells, biologics, and AI-driven drug design. They represent a shift from the traditional, symptom-based approach to root-cause correction at the level of genes, cells, or molecular pathways. Key Technology Pillars Genomic\u2013Proteomic Profiling Identifies patient-specific mutations, biomarkers, and disease signatures enabling personalised drug design. Gene & Cell Editing Technologies Includes CRISPR/Cas9 , CAR-T therapy , siRNA , and AAV (Adeno-Associated Virus) vectors for targeted or curative interventions. mRNA & Nucleic Acid Therapeutics Synthetic RNA can act as programmable instructions to produce missing or corrective proteins within cells. AI-Driven Drug Discovery Uses machine learning for molecular docking, target prediction, toxicity screening, and accelerated drug development. Significance of Precision Biotherapeutics for India 1. Targeted Cure Potential Unlike general drugs, precision therapies directly treat root-cause mutations . Example: CRISPR-based thalassemia therapy (Casgevy) approved by the US FDA and UK regulators in 2023. 2. Addressing India\u2019s NCD Burden Nearly 65% of deaths in India are due to non-communicable diseases. Standard medicine often fails for complex cancers, rare diseases, cardiometabolic disorders; precision medicine provides accurate, personalised solutions. 3. India-Specific Genomic Needs India\u2019s extreme genetic diversity means therapies developed abroad may not work optimally. Indigenous precision platforms are essential for \u201cIndia-specific genotype therapies.\u201d 4. Economic & Innovation Opportunity The global precision biotherapeutics market is projected to exceed USD 22 billion by 2027 , creating opportunities for biotech startups, IP creation, clinical trials, and high-value manufacturing. Challenges in India High Therapy Cost Global gene/cell therapies cost USD 0.5\u20132 million (e.g., Zolgensma: USD 2.1M), inaccessible to 99% of Indian households. Regulatory Gaps India still lacks a dedicated CDSCO approval pathway for gene, cell, RNA, and genome-edited products. Japan\u2019s PMDA regenerative fast-track is a model India could emulate. Insufficient Manufacturing Capacity India has a shortage of GMP-grade viral vector and biologics facilities. China, in comparison, runs 800+ ongoing gene/cell therapy trials . Skill Shortage India has only a few trained clinical geneticists compared to 4,000+ medical geneticists in the US . Ethical & Data Governance Concerns India lacks a specific genomic data protection law for biobanks and large datasets like IndiGen and GenomeIndia . Way Forward Dedicated Regulatory Pathway: Establish a CDSCO Gene\u2013Cell Therapy Division with accelerated approvals. Biomanufacturing Expansion: Create viral-vector & biologics GMP hubs under PLI-Biopharma . Genomic Data Governance: Enact a bio-banking and consent law , aligned with EU-GDPR norms.

Context: The Supreme Court of India has struck down multiple provisions of the Tribunals Reforms Act, 2021 , citing violation of judicial independence, separation of powers, and past constitutional rulings. The Court observed that Parliament had repeatedly re-enacted provisions already invalidated in earlier Madras Bar Association (MBA) judgments, amounting to a legislative override of judicial decisions . Why the SC Struck Down the Provisions 1. Re-enactment of Previously Invalidated Clauses The Court held that the Central Government had introduced nearly identical provisions that had already been struck down in the MBA (2020 & 2021) cases, which amounted to colourable legislation . 2. Executive Dominance Over Appointments Since the government is frequently a litigant before tribunals, allowing it control over: tenure, age limits, service conditions, and the final choice of members undermines natural justice and the independence of adjudication . 3. National Tribunal Commission (NTC) The Supreme Court directed the Centre to establish the National Tribunal Commission (NTC) within four months to ensure: independent appointments, uniform administration, transparent service rules, and reduced executive interference. Struck-Down Provisions of the 2021 Act 1. Four-Year Tenure The Act fixed a four-year term for chairpersons and members. SC held it unconstitutional because it increases dependence on the executive for reappointment and violates prior directions mandating at least a five-year term . 2. Minimum Age of 50 Years The Court struck this down for being discriminatory and blocking younger, competent advocates from entering tribunal service. 3. Panel of Two Names The Act required the Search-cum-Selection Committee (SCSC) to recommend two names per vacancy, allowing the executive to choose one .

Context (TH): The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a cold wave warning for several districts in Telangana , highlighting an unusual southward spread of cold-wave conditions. Telangana is also the only South Indian state included in IMD\u2019s core cold-wave zone . What is a Cold Wave? A cold wave refers to an abrupt and significant drop in temperature below the normal climatological average of a region during winter. Role of IMD The India Meteorological Department monitors winter temperatures and issues colour-coded warnings (Green, Yellow, Orange, Red). IMD uses minimum temperature thresholds and deviations from the long-term average to classify cold-wave intensity. Climatological Baseline Normal winter temperature values are based on IMD\u2019s 1981\u20132010 climatology dataset . Criteria for Declaring Cold Wave 1. Plains Cold wave declared when: Minimum temp \u2264 4\u00b0C , or Minimum temp \u2264 10\u00b0C and 4.5\u00b0C\u20136.4\u00b0C below normal 2. Hilly Regions Minimum temp \u2264 0\u00b0C , and 4.5\u00b0C\u20136.4\u00b0C below normal 3. Coastal Regions Minimum temp \u2264 15\u00b0C and \u22654.5\u00b0C below normal Severe Cold Wave Declared when: Minimum temp \u2264 2\u00b0C , or Temperature is \u22656.5\u00b0C below normal Why Do Cold Waves Occur in India? 1. Western Disturbances The passage of Western Disturbances brings cold, dry north-westerly winds from the Himalayas and Central Asia. 2. High-Pressure Systems The Siberian High intensifies and pushes cold continental air masses toward India. 3. Himalayan Snowfall More snowfall \u2192 stronger cold air advection into the northern plains. 4. Clear Skies Absence of clouds = strong nighttime radiative cooling , causing sharp temperature drops. 5. Dense Fog Fog blocks daytime solar radiation, worsening cold conditions. 6. La Ni\u00f1a Events IMD observations show La Ni\u00f1a years bring longer and more intense cold waves. 7. Continental Climate Interior regions far from the sea lack maritime moderation, making them more vulnerable. Consequences of Cold Waves 1. Health Risks Hypothermia Frostbite Asthma & COPD exacerbation Cardiovascular stress due to vasoconstriction India records ~824 annual deaths due to cold exposure. 2. Agricultural Losses Frost damage to crops Reduced livestock productivity Stress on horticultural crops during flowering/fruiting 3. Infrastructure & Transport Fog-induced delays in rail, road, and air transport Power demand surges \u2192 outages Water pipelines may freeze in northern hill states About the India Meteorological Department (IMD) Established in 1875 , IMD is India\u2019s National Meteorological Service . Functions under the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) . One of six Regional Specialized Meteorological Centres (RSMCs) under WMO. Provides: Meteorological observations Weather forecasts Disaster warnings for weather-sensitive sectors Conclusion Cold waves are a recurring winter hazard in India, driven by large-scale atmospheric circulation, local geography, and global climate patterns. With rising climatic variability, timely IMD alerts, climate-resilient agriculture, and public health preparedness have become essential for reducing cold-wave impacts.", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/rausias_yes.csv"}

Context: A five-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court delivered an important advisory opinion on the President\u2019s Reference concerning the Governor\u2019s powers to grant assent to Bills . The reference followed an earlier judgment where the Court held that prolonged inaction by Governors on State Bills is unconstitutional , and invoked Article 142 to declare those Bills as having received \u201cdeemed assent\u201d . The latest advisory settles key constitutional questions relating to Articles 200 , 201 , 142 , 143 , and 361 . 1. Scope of Article 200: Governor\u2019s Options The Supreme Court clarified that Article 200 provides only three choices when a Bill is presented to the Governor: Grant Assent Withhold Assent and Return the Bill (except Money Bills) Reserve the Bill for the President No Indefinite Delay The Constitution does not allow the Governor to sit indefinitely on a Bill. Any delay without reason is unconstitutional . Ministerial Advice The Governor is not bound by ministerial advice while choosing among these three constitutional options\u2014because Article 200 expressly gives the discretion. 2. Limits of Judicial Review The Bench clarified the extent to which courts can intervene: Permitted Judicial Review Courts can examine prolonged, unexplained inaction by the Governor. They can issue a limited mandamus directing a decision. Not Permitted Courts cannot review the merits of the Governor\u2019s decision to assent or withhold assent. Courts cannot impose deadlines because Article 200 uses the phrase \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d Courts cannot review the President\u2019s decision under Article 201. Article 361 immunity does not protect the Governor\u2019s office from questions of legality of inaction. 3. Judicial Role in the Assent Process Bills vs Laws Judicial review applies only to laws , not pending Bills . Courts cannot rule on the validity of a Bill before assent . No \u201cDeemed Assent\u201d The Court held that it cannot use Article 142 to deem assent where the Constitution requires explicit assent by the Governor or the President. President\u2019s Discretion (Article 201) The President\u2019s satisfaction is subjective . The President need not seek Supreme Court advice under Article 143 for every Bill. 4. Constitutional Timelines Though the Court cannot impose rigid deadlines, it stated: The phrase \u201cas soon as possible\u201d implies a constitutional urgency . The Governor and President must act within a reasonable timeframe consistent with democratic functioning. Relevant Constitutional Articles Article 200 \u2013 Governor\u2019s powers regarding assent, return, or reservation of Bills. Article 201 \u2013 Presidential decision on reserved Bills. Article 361 \u2013 Personal immunity of Governor/President. Article 142 \u2013 Supreme Court\u2019s powers to ensure complete justice. Article 143 \u2013 Presidential reference to the Supreme Court. Conclusion The Supreme Court\u2019s clarification strengthens constitutional federalism by reaffirming that Governors cannot block the legislative process through inaction. By limiting judicial intervention yet reinforcing constitutional responsibilities, the judgment ensures transparency, accountability, and cooperative federalism within India\u2019s democratic framework.", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/rausias_yes.csv"}

Context : On 18 November 2025 , a 2:1 majority of the Supreme Court recalled its May 2025 Vanashakti judgment , which had prohibited the granting of ex-post-facto environmental clearances (ECs) . The recall reopens the legal pathway for granting environmental approvals after a project has already begun construction or operation , subject to conditions. What Was the Vanashakti Judgment (May 2025)? The Supreme Court\u2019s earlier ruling had taken a strict environmental protection stance. It held that: Retrospective ECs are \u201cgross illegality\u201d and fundamentally opposed to environmental rule of law. The 2017 Notification and 2021 Office Memorandum , which allowed post-facto approvals, were struck down . It emphasised that regularising illegal construction weakens the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and contradicts the precautionary principle . Grounds for Recalling the Judgment (Nov 2025) The majority reconsidered the ruling for three key reasons: 1. Legal Consistency The Court noted that earlier Supreme Court cases \u2014 Pahwa Plastics Pvt Ltd (2022) D. Swamy vs KSPCB (2021) \u2014 had allowed post-facto ECs in exceptional circumstances . To avoid contradiction, the Court recalled the Vanashakti judgment for a fresh, larger review. 2. Economic Impact The May ruling risked demolition or shutdown of projects valued at ~\u20b920,000 crore , including pending expansions and partially completed facilities. 3. Public Interest Essential public infrastructure \u2014 Hospitals , Medical colleges , Airports \u2014 would face severe delays, affecting public welfare and regional development. Justice Bhuyan\u2019s Dissent: A Strong Environmental Stand Justice Bhuyan disagreed with the recall, arguing: 1. Earlier permissive rulings were per incuriam He held that Pahwa Plastics and D. Swamy ignored binding precedents such as: Common Cause (2017) Alembic Pharmaceuticals (2020) Both emphasised that prior EC is mandatory and violations cannot be lightly condoned. 2. Precautionary Principle is non-negotiable He stressed that post-facto ECs defeat the core purpose of environmental regulation \u2014 preventing harm before it occurs rather than legalising it after destruction is done. Environmental Clearance Framework in India Environmental clearances operate under the EIA Notification, 2006 , issued under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 . Key Features Mandatory prior EC for 39+ categories (mining, infrastructure, industry, power, river valley). Category A projects \u2192 appraised by MoEFCC (Central). Category B \u2192 appraised by SEIAA (State). Expert Appraisal Committees (EAC/SEAC) conduct technical scrutiny. Public hearing mandatory for Category A & B1, except defence/strategic and small-scale projects. Validity: Mining (30 yrs), River valley (10 yrs), Industry/Infrastructure (7 yrs). Conclusion The Supreme Court\u2019s recall highlights a fundamental tension between environmental protection and economic-development imperatives . The upcoming review will determine whether India\u2019s environmental governance framework prioritises the precautionary principle or accommodates post-facto approvals for broader public and economic considerations.", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/rausias_yes.csv"}

Context : The Indian Justice Report (IJR) , an initiative of Tata Trusts , has released a new study titled \u201cJuvenile Justice and Children in Conflict with the Law: A Study of Capacity at the Frontlines.\u201d The report evaluates the functioning of Juvenile Justice Boards (JJBs) and allied institutions under the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 , highlighting systemic gaps in capacity, data, and oversight. Key Findings of the Indian Justice Report 1. High Pendency of Cases As of October 2023 , 55% of 100,904 cases before JJBs were pending. Average pendency: 154 cases per JJB Odisha had the highest pendency ( 83% ) Karnataka reported the lowest ( 35% ) This backlog undermines the Act\u2019s requirement that inquiries be completed within four months . 2. Bench Shortages & Facility Gaps 25% of JJBs function without the mandatory three-member bench (Magistrate + 2 social workers). 30% of JJBs lack an attached Legal Services Clinic , blocking access to free legal aid. 14 states have not set up the statutory \u201cPlace of Safety\u201d for 16\u201318-year-olds involved in heinous offences. 3. Poor Standards Compliance Only 11 of 292 districts met all seven minimum standards required under the JJ framework. There are just 40 girls-only child-care homes across India, highlighting gendered neglect. 4. Data and Transparency Gaps Unlike the adult criminal justice system which uses the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) , juvenile justice lacks a centralised public data repository , impeding planning and monitoring. 5. Weak Oversight Only 40% of mandated inspections of Child Care Institutions (CCIs) were completed, despite recurring concerns over abuse, overcrowding, and untrained staff. 6. Coordination Deficit The report shows poor coordination among the four nodal agencies: Police Department of Women & Child Development State Child Protection Society (SCPS) State Legal Services Authority (SLSA) This fragmentation weakens rehabilitation, monitoring, and timely justice delivery. About Juvenile Justice Boards (JJBs) Legal Basis: Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 Purpose: Reformative, child-centric adjudication\u2014not punitive justice Composition: Chairperson: Metropolitan/Judicial Magistrate Two social workers (at least one woman) Functions: Inquiry into alleged offences Assessment of circumstances Formulation of rehabilitation and care plans Ensuring the child is produced within 24 hours About the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 The Act aligns India\u2019s juvenile framework with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) . Key Features: Categories of offences: Petty (\u22643 years), Serious (3\u20137 years), Heinous (\u22657 years) Adult Trial Provision: Children aged 16\u201318 may be tried as adults for heinous offences after a preliminary assessment by the JJB. Institutional Setup: Separate JJBs and Child Welfare Committees (CWCs) in every district. Conclusion The IJR highlights deep structural and institutional weaknesses in India\u2019s juvenile justice architecture. While the JJ Act, 2015 provides a progressive, child-centric legal framework, persistent shortages in manpower, infrastructure, data systems, and inter-agency coordination undermine effective implementation. Strengthening JJB capacity and creating a transparent, accountable ecosystem is essential to safeguard the rights and rehabilitation of children in conflict with the law.", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/rausias_yes.csv"}

{"id": "c2480e60-b0c4-48ab-955f-43bb234ccfed", "text": "SARAL SIMS Portal: Simplifying India\u2019s Steel Import Compliance. Context: The Ministry of Steel has launched the SARAL Steel Import Monitoring System (SIMS) portal to streamline and simplify registration requirements for small-volume and export-linked steel imports. The system replaces repetitive filings with a single annual registration, reducing compliance costs for MSMEs and export-oriented units. What is the SARAL SIMS Portal? The SARAL SIMS portal is a simplified digital registration mechanism under the existing Steel Import Monitoring System (SIMS). It aims to ease procedural requirements for importers dealing with low-volume steel consignments and imports linked to export obligations . Purpose Reduce the compliance burden on small importers Streamline registration for export-linked imports Ensure accurate national-level monitoring of steel import flows Key Features of the SARAL SIMS System 1. Single Annual Registration Importers must declare only their total intended annual import quantity . They receive one SARAL SIMS number , which can be used for multiple consignments throughout the financial year. This removes the earlier requirement of registering each shipment separately. 2. Small-Import Category Consignments up to \u226410 MT Annual cap: 1,000 MT Temporary cap: 500 MT until April 2026 This category is designed to support MSMEs, small traders, and artisans who import small quantities of specialised steel. 3. Export-Linked Category No quantity limits apply to imports made under: Advance Authorisation Special Economic Zones (SEZs) Export Oriented Units (EOUs) This facilitates smooth sourcing of raw materials for export production. Advance Authorisation Allows duty-free import of raw materials used to manufacture goods meant for export. SEZs Duty-free enclaves treated as foreign territory for trade and customs purposes. EOUs Units dedicated almost entirely to exports, permitted to import raw materials and machinery duty-free. 4. Validity and Compliance The SARAL SIMS number remains valid until 30 April of the following fiscal year . Importers must file a mandatory Annual Return by 30 April detailing actual import quantities. If actual imports exceed 1,000 MT , the importer must shift to the regular SIMS system for the rest of the year. Reversion to SARAL SIMS is not allowed within that financial year. Significance of the Portal 1. Reduces Compliance Burden Small importers are freed from repetitive documentation and multiple SIMS filings. 2.

Context : The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) , in its 2025 World Heritage Outlook , has classified the Western Ghats as a natural World Heritage Site of \u201csignificant concern\u201d due to increasing ecological pressures, fragmented governance, and climate-induced vulnerabilities. About the Western Ghats The Western Ghats , stretching for 1,600 km parallel to India\u2019s western coast, are among the world\u2019s oldest and most biologically diverse mountain systems. They span six states \u2014 Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu . Global Importance Recognised as one of 36 global biodiversity hotspots . One of India\u2019s four biodiversity hotspots . Inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site (WHS) in 2012 for its exceptional ecological value. Biodiversity Features The region supports extraordinary species diversity and endemism , hosting many rare and threatened species such as: Nilgiri Tahr Lion-tailed Macaque Tiger Asian Elephant It also contains unique ecosystems like shola forests , montane grasslands, and high-altitude swamps. Major Threats Highlighted by the IUCN Outlook 2025 1. Climate Change Increasing temperatures, altered monsoon cycles, and frequent extreme events (landslides, floods, droughts) are forcing sensitive species to migrate into shrinking habitats. 2. Landscape Fragmentation Linear infrastructure \u2014 highways, railways, power corridors, and dams \u2014 breaks ecological connectivity and obstructs wildlife movement, increasing human-wildlife conflicts. 3. Monoculture Plantations Large-scale conversion of native forests into tea, coffee, rubber, and areca plantations reduces biodiversity, weakens soil health, and diminishes natural resilience. 4. Invasive Species Aggressive non-native trees such as acacia and eucalyptus outcompete indigenous flora, alter nutrient cycles, and disrupt natural ecosystem regeneration. 5. Tourism and Pilgrimage Pressure Unregulated tourism increases waste generation, air and noise pollution, and disturbs fragile wildlife zones, especially in high-altitude sanctuaries. 6. Governance Gaps Although the Ghats contain 39 protected areas across six states, jurisdictional overlaps complicate integrated management, leaving corridors poorly protected. Government Initiatives to Protect the Western Ghats 1. Statutory Protection Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 These govern diversion of forest land and protect wildlife habitats. 2. Protected Area Network The region includes: 2 biosphere reserves (Nilgiri, Agasthyamalai) 13 national parks (e.g., Silent Valley, Periyar ) Several wildlife sanctuaries 3. UNESCO World Heritage Obligations The 2012 WHS recognition requires state-specific conservation and management plans . 4. ESA Proposals Based on the Gadgil Committee (2011) and Kasturirangan Committee (2013) , the government has proposed Ecologically Sensitive Areas (ESA) to regulate mining, quarrying, construction, and thermal projects. 5. CAMPA Funding Kerala and Tamil Nadu are using CAMPA resources for shola\u2013grassland restoration , fire-line creation, and invasive species management. Conclusion The Western Ghats face increasing ecological and governance pressures. The IUCN\u2019s \u201csignificant concern\u201d classification signals the urgency for coordinated conservation , improved regulation, landscape-level planning, and community-based stewardship to safeguard one of India\u2019s richest ecological treasures.", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/rausias_yes.csv"}

{"id": "09f80c86-cbeb-4189-b7cf-5ae869ac6709", "text": "Royalty Rationalisation for Critical Minerals. Context : The Union Cabinet has approved revised ad valorem royalty rates for four critical minerals \u2014 graphite, caesium, rubidium, and zirconium \u2014 with the aim of strengthening domestic mining, improving auction success, and reducing India\u2019s dependence on imports for clean-energy supply chains. The reform aligns with India\u2019s broader strategy to secure critical mineral value chains essential for EVs, semiconductors, batteries, renewable energy technologies, and defence manufacturing. Revised Royalty Rates Caesium: 2% of Average Sale Price (ASP) on metal content in ore Rubidium: 2% of ASP on metal content in ore Zirconium: 1% of ASP on metal content in ore Graphite: 80% fixed carbon \u2192 2% of ASP <80% fixed carbon \u2192 4% of ASP The shift from fixed-rate royalty to ad valorem ensures flexibility with market fluctuations, improving the viability of low-grade mineral extraction. Why India Needed Royalty Reform 1. High Import Dependence India is 100% import-dependent for lithium, cobalt, nickel, and rare earth elements (REEs). It imports 60% of graphite , a key component of anodes used in EV batteries. 2. Low Auction Success Rates Since 2023, only 34 out of 81 critical mineral blocks (42%) found bidders \u2014 high royalty rates and pricing ambiguity made projects commercially unattractive. 3. Surging Green-Tech Demand EV battery requirements are projected to rise 5\u20136 times by 2030 , significantly increasing demand for graphite, zirconium, and REEs. 4. Unviable Mining under Old Rates Fixed per-tonne royalties hurt miners during global price declines, making low-grade extraction unprofitable. 5. China-Dominated Supply Chains China processes ~90% of the world\u2019s REEs . Its export controls have demonstrated the vulnerability of global clean-tech supply chains. Structural Bottlenecks in India\u2019s Critical Mineral Ecosystem Weak Exploration Capacity: <0.9% of global mineral exploration spending; far lower than Australia (~13%) or Canada (~15%). Limited Processing Capability: India processes <2% of global REEs; refined copper output is just 3% globally. High Capital & Tech Gaps: Private exploration contributes <10% of India\u2019s total spend (vs >60% in mature mining economies). Skilled Manpower Shortage: <20 geologists per million population (Australia: 140+). Fragmented Policy Environment: Regulatory delays and unclear pricing deter bidders. Way Forward Boost Exploration: Strengthen the National Mineral Exploration Trust (NMET); emulate Australia\u2019s drilling reimbursement model. Domestic Processing: Introduce a PLI-style scheme for refining and processing critical minerals, similar to China\u2019s refining clusters. Fast-Track Clearances: Create a unified portal integrating environment, forest, and concession approvals (Canada\u2019s \u201cone-window\u201d model). Tech & Skills Partnerships: Collaborate with US, Australia, and Japan for mineral processing technologies and workforce training. Strategic Stockpiles: Establish reserves of lithium, cobalt, and REEs, similar to Japan\u2019s JOGMEC model, to cushion supply disruptions. About Royalty Definition: Statutory payment made by miners to the government (the sovereign owner of mineral resources). Purpose: Ensures states receive fair value while enabling responsible extraction. Legal Basis: Governed by the Second Schedule of the MMDR Act, 1957 . Types of Royalty: Unit-based (per tonne) Ad valorem (% of sale value) \u2013 preferred for critical minerals Profit-based (share of net earnings)", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/rausias_yes.csv"}

{"id": "d8dc88d9-eea8-4ca2-adea-f9c59153608d", "text": "Digital Sequence Information (DSI) and the Global Debate. Digital Sequence Information (DSI) has emerged as one of the most contentious negotiation points at the 11th Governing Body Meeting of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) being held in Lima, Peru . As countries push for equitable use of genetic resources, DSI has created new challenges beyond traditional Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) systems. What is Digital Sequence Information (DSI)? DSI refers to the digital representation of genetic material derived from biological resources. It includes: Nucleic acid sequences (DNA/RNA) Protein structures Metabolic profiles Epigenetic markers Annotated biological datasets These datasets are stored in major open-access global repositories such as GenBank (USA) , EMBL-EBI (UK) and the DNA Data Bank of Japan , collectively operating under the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) . INSDC ensures unified standards and free availability of global nucleotide-sequence data. DSI allows scientists to analyse genetic information without needing physical samples , thereby accelerating research, supporting synthetic biology, and enabling rapid diagnostics development. Benefits of DSI Accelerated Research: It removes dependence on time-consuming physical sample collection and permits fast computational analysis. Rapid Data Sharing: Open-access platforms facilitate quick development of vaccines, diagnostics, and precision treatments. Lower Barriers to Research: No transport permits or biosafety logistics are required for digital data, reducing cost and administrative hurdles. Targeted Therapies: Big-data analysis of sequences enables identification of disease-specific markers for highly precise interventions. Challenges and Concerns Despite its advantages, DSI has triggered serious global concerns: Unfair Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS): Companies can commercialise products using genetic data from biodiverse nations without sharing benefits, as DSI falls outside the CBD and Nagoya Protocol\u2019s ABS mechanisms. Regulatory Uncertainty: There is no universally accepted legal definition of DSI, making policy harmonisation difficult. Traceability Issues: Tracking the origin of a genetic sequence or its commercial pathway is extremely complex. Capacity Gap: Developing countries lack sequencing infrastructure, skilled bioinformaticians, and data-processing capability, limiting their participation. To address ABS gaps, CBD COP16 (2024) in Colombia created the \u2018Cali Fund\u2019 , aimed at ensuring fair and equitable benefit-sharing arising from the commercial use of DSI. ITPGRFA and India's Position The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) , adopted in 2001 and in force since 2004, focuses on conserving and providing access to plant genetic resources essential for food and agriculture. It currently has 155 contracting parties (154 countries + EU). India\u2019s Membership India ratified the treaty in 2002 through the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers\u2019 Rights (PPV&FR) Act, 2001 and the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 . Multilateral System (MLS) The treaty establishes the MLS, offering rule-based access to 64 Annex-I crops crucial for global food security. Access is governed through Standard Material Transfer Agreements (SMTA) , which prohibit claiming intellectual property rights over MLS material. As DSI becomes central to genetic research, global negotiations aim to balance open science with fairness to biodiversity-rich nations.", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/rausias_yes.csv"}

Context : India\u2019s Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) consumption has surged to 31.3 million metric tonnes (MMT) in FY25 , driven by expanded household access under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) and growing commercial and industrial demand. With usage expected to reach 33\u201334 MMT in FY26 , LPG continues to dominate India\u2019s clean cooking energy transition. About LPG LPG is a compressed mixture of propane and butane (\u224840:60) used for: Cooking (household sector) Industrial applications Food services and transport It burns cleaner than biomass, kerosene, and coal, significantly reducing indoor air pollution. Trends in India\u2019s LPG Sector 1. Strong Growth in National Consumption FY17: 21.6 MMT FY25: 31.3 MMT FY26 (projected): 33\u201334 MMT This represents one of the fastest-growing clean fuel transitions globally. 2. PMUY\u2019s Transformational Impact Under PMUY, household LPG coverage expanded across rural and low-income homes. Average refill consumption increased from 3.9 cylinders/year to 4.5 cylinders/year . Improved affordability, last-mile delivery expansion and behavioural shift strengthened LPG dependence. The scheme dramatically reduced household smoke exposure and supported women\u2019s health and safety. 3. Rising Commercial and Industrial Use Commercial and industrial consumers increased their share of total LPG demand: Earlier: ~10% FY25: ~16% Growth is driven by: Food service chains Institutional kitchens MSME clusters shifting away from solid fuels 4. Persistent Supply Gap and Import Dependence Domestic LPG production increased modestly: FY17: 11.2 MMT FY25: 12.8 MMT But imports rose sharply to ~20.7 MMT , keeping dependence at 55\u201360% . India is currently the world\u2019s second-largest LPG importer after China. 5. Import Diversification for Energy Security Middle East supplies dominate India\u2019s imports ( 91\u201393% ). The new India\u2013US LPG agreement (2.2 MTPA) diversifies sourcing, reduces geopolitical exposure, and strengthens long-term energy security. About Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) A flagship central sector scheme by the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas , launched in 2016 , providing deposit-free LPG connections to women in low-income households. Eligibility Groups BPL households SC/ST families Antyodaya beneficiaries Forest dwellers SECC-listed households Migrants Women in island territories Note: Households without an adult woman are ineligible. Achievements 10.33 crore LPG connections provided 238+ crore refills in 9 years PMUY has significantly enhanced women\u2019s health, reduced drudgery, and accelerated India\u2019s adoption of clean cooking fuels. Conclusion India\u2019s rising LPG consumption reflects both social welfare gains from PMUY and economic expansion . However, persistent import dependence underscores the need for domestic production enhancement, diversification of suppliers, and a long-term transition toward cleaner alternatives like bio-LPG , ethanol-based fuels , and green hydrogen derivatives .", "label": "YES", "source": "file:////Users/harshvardhanjha/upsc-news-digest/data/rausias_yes.csv"}
