1,2024,The Hindu,1,"Editor’s Note: Putting Muslims in their place? The return of Donald Trump to the White House shows how demagogues the world over are successfully convincing large swathes of voters that their continuing post-pandemic distress will vanish magically if they get rid of that one evil enemy. Trump identified this enemy as illegal immigrants and others whom he ominously called “the enemy within”, which seems to be the American equivalent of the “urban naxal”. If Israel and India have both created models of virulent masculinity, as Martha Nussbaum wrote, this is derived from the sense of eternal victimhood that Zionist and Hindutva fundamentalists share, and both direct their aggression at Muslims, whom the Christian colonial project had already conveniently vilified. Since 2014, a series of measures has sought to demonise India’s Muslim community—the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019,the criminalisation of triple talaq, and the various jehads fromCOVIDandlove jehadto land jehad and vote jehad. Even for the Jharkhand Assembly election campaign, the BJP has aggressively raised the bogey ofillegal Bangladeshi immigrantsrobbing tribal lands and tribal women. That the spotlight would soon turn on the Waqf Board was never in doubt. Hindutva warriors have always spread the jealous narrative of waqf being the largest property owner after the Railways and Army, a carefully cultivated piece of disinformation. If one considers that the Hindu religious boards in the three States of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana alone control more than 10 lakh acres of land, then the 9.4 lakh acres estimated to be under waqf falls into better perspective; even more so when you consider, as the Congress party’s Rajya Sabha MP Syed Naseer Hussain explains in his interview to Vikhar Ahmed Sayeed in this issue, that even the smallest cemetery and mosque in the country is technically waqf land. The returns from waqf properties have always been low and not used adequately for the benefit of disadvantaged Muslims.

2,2025,The Hindu,2,"Alarm foils bid to loot ATM in Erode An attempted break-in at the Indian Overseas Bank ATM on Karur Road near Kollampalayam was reported early Wednesday morning (December 3, 2025). The police said the branch and its adjacent ATM kiosk, which also houses a cash deposit machine, were closed by staff as usual after banking hours on Tuesday (December 2, 2025). Around midnight, the alarm at the kiosk was triggered, prompting staff to rush to the spot. They reportedly found that a few wires had been disconnected, while the miscreants had fled the scene. On Wednesday morning, when the CCTV footage was reviewed, it was found that an unidentified person had attempted to break open the machine. The alarm sound forced the intruder to abandon the effort and escape, and no cash loss was reported. Based on a complaint from the bank staff, the Erode South police collected forensic evidence from the spot and have launched an investigation.",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/alarm-foils-bid-to-loot-atm-in-erode/article70353090.ece
3,2025,The Hindu,3,"Former England cricketer Robin Smith dies at 62 Former England cricketer Robin Smith, who fought some intense battles with pacers in the 1980s and 90s, passed away at his home in Perth, Australia, on Tuesday (December 2, 2025). He was 62. Smith played 62 Tests between 1988 and 1996 and made 4236 runs at 43.67 with nine hundreds, but his impact on English cricket at that period was much more profound than his numbers, excellent anyway. The powerful right-hander was at his tenacious best against the West Indies pacers like Curtly Ambrose, Courtney Walsh, Malcolm Marshall and Patrick Patterson, when his teammate often sank into a pool of struggle. In possession of a withering square cut, often deemed as one of the fiercest strokes in cricketing history, Smith was at his peak between 1990 and 1995, playing a lead role in England drawing back-to-back Test series against the West Indies. England managed an identical 2-2 series result in the 1990-91 away tour and then four years later at home. England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) Chair Richard Thompson said: “Robin Smith was a player who stood toe to toe with some of the quickest bowlers in the world, meeting spells of hostile fast bowling with a defiant smile and an incredible resilience. He did so in a way that gave England fans enormous pride, and no shortage of entertainment. “He was a batter ahead of his time which was typified in that unforgettable unbeaten 167 from 163 balls in an ODI against Australia at Edgbaston in 1993. “His record at Hampshire is exemplary, and he'll be remembered rightly as a great of Hampshire CCC. We're desperately sad to learn of his passing, and the thoughts of all of us in cricket are with his friends, family and loved ones.”  	 However, Smith was born in Durban in 1963 and later moved to Hampshire, England, under the influence of fellow South Africans Barry Richards and Mike Procter. He made his Test debut for England against the West Indies in 1988 at Headingley, and formed a long association with fellow South African-origin cricket",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/former-england-cricketer-robin-smith-dies-at-62/article70349540.ece
4,2025,The Hindu,4,"IOC president calls for end to ‘finger-pointing’ in doping fight International Olympic Committee president Kirsty Coventry and her World Anti-Doping Agency counterpart on Tuesday (December 2, 2025) called for unity in the fight against performance-enhancing drugs following a fracture with the United States. “Too often we’ve seen energy spent on division, finger-pointing and competing agendas,” Ms. Coventry told WADA’s World Conference on Doping in Sport, being held this week in the South Korean city of Busan. “It has been difficult to watch this divide within our community.” Her comments came nearly 18 months after an internal investigation cleared WADA of pro-China bias. The agency was rocked by a scandal involving 23 Chinese swimmers who were cleared of intentionally doping after testing positive for a banned heart drug in 2021. Chinese investigators absolved the swimmers — some of whom went on to win Olympic gold in Tokyo that year — of wrongdoing, saying that the athletes had been exposed to the drug via a contaminated hotel kitchen. WADA opted not to independently investigate the matter, sparking criticism, especially from the United States and its anti-doping organisation, USADA. Following WADA’s decision, the U.S. government withdrew $3.6 million in funding, resulting in the removal of U.S. representatives from the body’s executive committee. “There is only one fight that we should be fighting — and that is the fight against doping,” Ms. Coventry told the gathering in Busan. “But instead, at times, we have been turning on each other. The only people who benefit from this disunity are the drugs cheaters.” Taking a similar line, WADA president Witold Banka did not reference any one country by name but said that “some voices have chosen confrontation over cooperation, speaking as if their nations or institutions stand above others, as if only they acted with integrity”. He added: “To those who behave as though they come from ‘better’ systems, expecting the world to follow their personal crusades, we say respectfully but firml",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/ioc-president-calls-for-end-to-finger-pointing-in-doping-fight/article70351175.ece

The event, held on December 3, also highlighted the need for greater awareness and inclusivity of such persons across political, social, economic, and cultural spheres. Sheikh Tanveer Asif, Mysuru City Corporation Commissioner, inaugurated the event and said that AIISH has evolved into a platform for achievement and helped showcase a pathway for shaping the future. It is also a space where challenges are addressed with curiosity and resilience, he added. The Commissioner said every child has unique abilities and parental support and timely intervention can lead to remarkable progress. Providing essential facilities is a collective responsibility, said Mr. Asif as he lauded mothers of children with disabilities as embodiments of strength and compassion.

Kohli (102, 93 balls) and Gaikwad (105, 83b) added a record 195 runs for the third wicket as India recovered well from 62 for two. It was Kohli’s second hundred in as many matches after going past the three digits in the first game at Ranchi on Sunday (November 30, 2025). Kohli’s magnificent hundred in the second ODI helped India cross the 250-run mark. He stitched a superb 195-run stand for the fourth wicket with Ruturaj Gaikwad. The 28-year-old Gaikwad also slammed his maiden century in ODI cricket. The right-handed batter was dismissed for 105 runs off 83 deliveries, including 12 fours and two sixes. The third wicket stand was also India’s highest against South Africa for any wicket in ODIs. South Africa’s struggles on an easy-paced pitch was deepened once pacer Nandre Burger had to walk off the field in his seventh over, owing to an ankle niggle. Marco Jansen was SA’s most successful bowler (2/63) as he employed short-pitched balls to good effect.

City winger Jeremy Doku crossed to the big Norwegian who finished with a first-time shot, achieving the feat in 111 games, 13 fewer than the previous fastest centurion Alan Shearer. While Shearer still holds the all-time record with 260 goals, the 25-year-old Haaland looks destined to chase it down. ""If you told me when he arrived that he’d score 100 goals in 111 games, I’d say, ‘Are you sure?’ The numbers are insane. Today he was unbelievable,"" City boss Pep Guardiola said. ""It's incredible, impressive. He was outstanding, today he was unbelievable. He made a fantastic goal. Hopefully, he's starving hungry to continue with this club to make more and more goals. I'm happy for him, happy for the team to deliver him this day."" Haaland, whose father Alf-Inge watched from the stands at Craven Cottage, admitted the moment was special. “Proud moment, 100 club is a huge thing,"" he said. ""To do it this quickly is amazing. I'm proud, I'm happy. ""I've said it many times — a striker for City should score a lot of goals. That's my job, that's what I try to do. And I'm not bad at it!

8,2025,The Hindu,8,"Over 12,500 dogs sterilised and vaccinated in Erode Corporation limits The Erode Corporation has sterilised and vaccinated 12,554 stray dogs in two years in the city under the Animal Birth Control (ABC) programme, which was launched in January last year. Though the civic body launched the programme in 2010, it was discontinued within a few weeks leading to sharp increase in the number of stray dogs in all the 60 Wards in the four zones of Erode city. In 2023, a GPS-based survey conducted by the Corporation estimated the city’s stray dog population at about 27,000. The civic body engaged Animal Helping Hands, an NGO, to carry out the programme at the ABC centre in Solar. On an average, about 1,200 dogs are sterilised each month. The NGO is paid ₹1,650 a dog for capturing, sterilising, vaccinating against rabies, and releasing it in its locality. A health official said that in the first phase, carried out between January 12, 2024 and November 2024, a total of 4,998 dogs were sterilised at ₹82.46 lakh. In the second phase, between December 2024 and August 2025, a total of 5,000 dogs were sterilised, with an expenditure of ₹82.50 lakh.

9,2025,The Hindu,9,"Cybercrime may become harder and costlier with Sanchar Saathi, but far from impossible, say Telangana police A day after theUnion government rolled out Sanchar Saathi app for mobile devices, the cybercrime officials of Telangana police said that the move could make committing a cyber fraud significantly harder and costlier, but not impossible. According to senior officials, the app’s real strength lies in shutting down the anonymity and easy access to SIM cards that fuel most online frauds. “Users can see how many mobile connections exist in their name and block the ones they never took. Fraudsters rely on forged KYC to access bulk SIMs for scams. If people start reporting these instantly, we choke off one of the biggest supply chains of cybercrime,” a Telangana Cyber Security Bureau (TGCSB) official said. The timing, they pointed out, is critical. Just two days earlier, the Centre issued SIM-binding directions that link messaging apps to the active SIM in a device. Together these steps will make it far easier to trace numbers involved in frauds, particularly ‘digital arrest’, and far harder for criminals to rotate identities at will, said an official from the Hyderabad cybercrime wing. “This is a proactive approach that stops fraud in its tracks,” said a cyber security expert working closely with the Telangana police. “When a user reports a suspicious number, the app can immediately trigger the telecom operator to block it, cutting off the fraudster’s next moves. In fact, hundreds of other potential victims can be spared from falling prey, because scammers rely on volume, one blocked number can save countless people.” The app also enables users to block a lost or stolen phone and trace it if someone tries to use it through IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) mapping. According to Devroop Dhar, a tech expert, this will push up the “cost of doing crime”, likely reducing it by a small percentage. “Access to stolen/lost devices and bulk SIMs is what makes cybercrime inexpensive.

11,2025,The Hindu,11,"Arvind Kejriwal: People will vote forkaam ki rajneeti It has been difficult to get an interview withArvind Kejriwal. Not only is it a question of time, Kejriwal is also wary of “mainstream” media, a fact that he admits when we finally meet. After a postponement, the interview is set for 9:00 pm, and when we get to his current residence at 5 Ferozeshah Road, Kejriwal has just returned from a long day of campaigning for what is being seen as a make-or-break election for both him and his party. But Kejriwal himself does not display any such anxiety. He enters the drawing room with a smile and a slight spring in his step, visibly tired but upbeat. As we talk, his social media team calls every now and then, relating tweets that make him smile. He asks them to draft a quote tweet “that I will check later”. Hearing the news that Dhruv Rathee’s upload of Unbreakable, a 30-minute documentary about his arrest (whose screening was stopped by the Delhi Police), has garnered 8.5 million views on YouTube, his smile widens. “By stopping it, they achieved just the opposite,” he says. In the freewheeling conversation that follows, Kejriwal says that he is confident of winning Delhi a third time. According to him, people will vote his government back in because of its “kaam ki rajneeti” (politics of delivery). He adds: “Delhi is the only State with 24x7 free electricity. Have you seen government schools like ours? Or mohalla clinics?” When asked about the corruption charges against him, he says that if they were true, theAam Aadmi Partywould not have to resort to crowdfunding. The frequent run-ins with the Lieutenant Governor (L-G) do not appear to faze him—“we will manage”—nor do the multiple cases against him and his party members, but when he talks of his plans to counter the BJP, Kejriwal’s voice takes on an edge.

13,2025,The Hindu,13,"SMAT | Hardik sizzles on comeback as Baroda gets the better of Punjab in a run-fest There was palpable tension surrounding Baroda’s Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy clash with Punjab, for it was billed as the big-ticket event of the series. It was Hardik Pandya vs Abhishek Sharma, the wily, veteran vs the hot-blooded youngster. Fans turned up in larger numbers at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Tuesday and the two (players and teams) did not disappoint. Abhishek, fresh from his breathtaking century against Bengal, brought out the pyrotechnics early, as he invariably does. Powered by five boundaries and four sixes, he brought up his fifty off 18 balls, but couldn’t consolidate further, falling to Raj Lambani’s change of pace. A former Sunrisers Hyderabad man, Anmolpreet Singh’s familiarity with the venue showed in his 32-ball 69 (7x4, 4x6) to help Punjab set a 223-run target. Baroda was buoyed by a 66-run opening stand between Vishnu Solakni and Shashwat Rawat. Solanki’s dismissal brought in Hardik, who dished out the same treatment he was accorded in the Punjab innings. A 101-run partnership off 60 balls with Shivalik Sharma kept the asking rate well in control. With 14 needed off nine balls, Hardik then turned on the afterburners, smacking consecutive sixes to put Baroda a whisker away from victory, which was sealed by a cheeky boundary from Jitesh Sharma. In more subdued settings later in the day, Haryana registered a six-wicket win against Services. Nakul Sharma’s half-century helped the latter set a modest 158-run target. While Haryana stumbled regularly, Ankit Kumar’s unbeaten 78 ensured his side came away with its campaign’s second win. At the Gymkhana Ground, Gujarat’s Japagnya Bhatt and Ravi Bishnoi put the squeeze on Pondicherry, picking three wickets each to bundle it out for 83. Abhishek Desai’s unbeaten 53 ensured Gujarat’s chase was a cakewalk, with 11 overs to spare.

Special Judge M.N. Senthil Kumar awarded the punishment to S. Balu alias Paul Mathew, who resided at Kumaran Street at Varadharajapuram Medu near Singanallur in Coimbatore, and his wife Sherlin Sheeba. As per the charges-sheet filed by the Economic Offences Wing-II (EOW), Balu and Sheeba ran real estate firm Chola Promoters on Kothari Mill Lane at Singanallur. The company advertised through television and newspapers that house sites were available for sale in a site called Ganapathy Garden B block at Edayarpalayam near Pappampatti, for which an advance of ₹25,000 and a monthly instalment of ₹5,000 had to be paid per site. After seeing the advertisement, B. Senthil Kumar of Kavundampalayam paid ₹2,97,500 for two sites. The sites were not registered in the name of Kumar though he had paid the entire amount. He lodged a complaint with the City Crime Branch (CCB) in August 2016 after the office of the real estate firm was found shut and the promoters missing. The alleged cheating took place from July 2013 to February 2016 and CCB registered a case against the firm and the couple, which was transferred to EOW-II in February 2017. The court found the accused guilty of offences under Sections 120B, 420 and 5 of TNPID Act after the trial. Special Public Prosecutor C.

22,2025,The Hindu,22,"IND vs SA second ODI: Rohit and Kohli’s support automatically improves performance, says Harshit Rana South Africa was rocked early while chasing in the first ODI at Ranchi, largely due to a fiery opening spell from Harshit Rana. The pacer, along with Arshdeep Singh, reduced the visitors to 11 for three inside the first five overs, laying a strong platform for tweaker Kuldeep Yadav to take control and seal the victory. Addressing the media on the eve of the second ODI here, the lanky bowler reflected on his performance, the importance of staying focused on his work while shutting out outside noise, and the impact of having two stalwarts [Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli] in the dressing room — something he believes has significantly shaped his growth. “Honestly, it’s a big thing not just for me but for the whole team. When players with so much experience are around you — whether on the field or in the dressing room — the environment becomes very nice. They always tell youngsters that we can do better. That kind of support automatically improves performance,” he said. “The team is in a very happy and positive space. They always motivate us, whether things go well or not. They guide us on what the next step should be, especially when you are under pressure on the field,” added the 24-year-old. On dealing with social-media pressures, Harshit was clear and honest: “I just focus on what I need to do on the ground — my hard work and my processes. What happens outside doesn’t matter. If I start listening to everything on social media, I won’t be able to play cricket. So I try to avoid it as much as possible.” On bowling alongside Arshdeep and working with bowling coach Morne Morkel, Harshit said: “Morne has huge experience, and I talk to him often. Arshdeep helps me a lot in practice, too. They constantly guide me on what to do and how to improve.”",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ind-vs-sa-second-odi-rohit-and-kohlis-support-automatically-improves-performance-says-harshit-rana/article70350129.ece

Mr. Horatti emphasised the need for the ruling dispensation to take special care of persons with disabilities and he would also raise pending issues pertaining to their welfare with the Chief Minister. He said that the government was also working towards the welfare of persons with disabilities by implementing various programmes and schemes for them. He also emphasised the need for the general public in joining hands with the government for the welfare of persons with disabilities. Presiding over the function, MLA Mahesh Tenginakai said that self confidence was the biggest strength of persons with disabilities and it was everyone’s duty to boost their self confidence.

Former Inspector General of Police (IGP) Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, who turned a witness and testified before the tribunal against Ms. Hasina and Mr. Kamal, has been sentenced to five years in prison after he admitted to his involvement in the crackdown of the protests which led to the fall of the Hasina government. The verdict by the International Crimes Tribunal-1 (ICT-1) represents the most dramatic legal action against the Awami League leader and comes just months before the parliamentary elections, which are scheduled for February. The tribunal also asked the government to provide compensation to the families of the victims and to those who were injured during the crackdown. Attorney-General Md Asaduzzaman said Ms. Hasina, who is now in exile in India, and Mr. Kamal, who is also in exile, cannot appeal the ruling as long as they remain fugitives. He further said the court had ordered the attachment and confiscation of all properties belonging to Ms. Hasina and Mr. Kamal within Bangladesh, and that the state would take all necessary legal measures to implement the verdict. ICT hearing updates on death sentence to ousted Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina, former Minister Kamal Ms. Hasina said the charges are unjustified, arguing that she and Mr. Khan “acted in good faith and were trying to minimise the loss of life.” “We lost control of the situation, but to characterise what happened as a premeditated assault on citizens is simply to misread the facts,” she said on Monday in a statement. “I mourn all of the deaths that occurred in July and August of last year, on both sides of the political divide.

25,2025,The Hindu,25,"IPL 2026: Unlikely to get bidders, Glenn Maxwell pulls out of auctions Glenn Maxwell, whose IPL career over the last decade has largely been underwhelming, decided to pull out of the upcoming mini auctions scheduled in Abu Dhabi on December 16. The 37-year-old, popularly known as ""Big Show"" for being a phenomenal talent in his younger days, has played every IPL season since 2012, barring one in 2019. He has managed only 2819 runs in 141 games at a strike rate of 155 plus and an average of less than 24, which doesn't justify the kind of prices that he has been consistently fetching in auctions over the years. He also picked 41 wickets with his off-breaks at an economy rate of 8.30. A post shared by Glenn Maxwell (@gmaxi_32) ""After many unforgettable seasons in the IPL, I 've decided not to put my name into auctions this year.  It's a big call and one I make with a lot of gratitude for everything this league has given me,"" Maxwell wrote on his instagram page. ""The IPL has shaped me as a cricketer and as a person. I have been lucky to play with world class teammates, incredible franchises, and perform in-front of fans whose passion is unmatched. The memories, challenges and the energy of India will stay with me forever."" While Maxwell didn’t specify a reason, it is evident that most major franchises have grown weary of waiting for him to deliver a good season, something that has been rare. His multi-million dollar bids at auction often defied logic with franchise owners attributing it to market forces. But with increased use of data analytics, it has become clear that Maxwell was being paid way more than he ever deserved. Out of 13 seasons that he has played, only once in 2021 did he cross 500 runs — 513 with six fifties and a strike rate of 144 plus. That he is no longer an attractive commodity in the IPL market was evident across last two seasons (2024 and 2025) where he totalled a lowly 100 runs in 17 games with aggregate of 52 and 48 runs respectively. During the last season, he had left after playing seven games and didn't come back ",,,View this post on Instagram;A post shared by Glenn Maxwell (@gmaxi_32),https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ipl-2026-unlikely-to-get-bidders-glenn-maxwell-pulls-out-of-auctions/article70348639.ece

In all, 1,355 players have registered for the auction and shared with the franchises on Monday after registrations closed on November 30. With each franchise allowed a maximum squad of 25, and 77 slots are available this year, including 31 for overseas players. The IPL will trim this list after receiving the wishlists from all ten teams. Franchises have been given time until December 5 to submit their shortlist, ahead of the day-long auction in Abu Dhabi on December 16. Among the Indian players, specialists in key roles could attract big bids, but the spotlight is firmly on Australian all-rounder Cameron Green, who had skipped the 2025 mega-auction due to a back injury. Teams expected to show strong interest include Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) (₹64.3 crore purse) and Chennai Super Kings (CSK) (₹43.4 crore), both having healthy budgets. KKR, in particular, could aggressively pursue Green, especially after the recent IPL retirement of West Indies T20 legend Andre Russell. Green’s versatility, he can bat anywhere in the order, bowl seam-ups, and contribute heavily in the field, makes him one of the most sought-after names this year. KKR released nine players, including Venkatesh Iyer, who cost them a massive ₹23.5 crore at last year’s mega-auction. They now have 12 slots to fill, including six overseas. CSK, the five-time champions, have nine vacancies, four of which are for overseas players. Several players released ahead of this auction have chosen the top price bracket of ₹2 crore.

After Aman miscued a slower one in Shivam Mavi’s first over, Tanmay exhibited his superb shots. The left-hander confidently pulled for a four and two sixes and hoisted another maximum over long-off off Mavi’s second over. Hyderabad was comfortably placed at 62 for two in the PowerPlay before the deceptive Vipraj Nigam and left-arm spinner Prashant Veer picked up five wickets between them to put Hyderabad under pressure. Lower-order batters Arfaz Khan (13 n.o., 11b) and Nitin Yadav (10 n.o., 12b) formed an unbroken 22-run stand to take Hyderabad to victory.

So, it was important that some of us stepped up and helped the team win. Whenever I have played in this ground (Narendra Modi Stadium B-Ground), it’s always been a high-scoring game.

Fireworks were expected when Baroda drafted him into the playing eleven for its Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy clash against Punjab, his first competitive game of cricket since India’s Asia Cup Super Four match against Sri Lanka on September 26. The plan to increase security was validated when 10,000-odd fans thronged the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium and all streets leading to it on Tuesday. Hardik delivered, but chose cautious stability over spectacle. While he landed in the city earlier this week, there remained some doubt about Baroda fielding Hardik immediately. All doubts withered away as he walked out for pre-match training.

A flat pitch offered nothing for the all-rounder to work with as he finished as his team’s most expensive bowler. The wicket of Anmolpreet Singh was consolation on a day when he conceded 52 runs (7x4, 2x6). None of that brought down the tension in the air, as fans waited with bated breath to see the all-rounder wielding his willow. Coming into bat in the sixth over, Hardik masterfully kept Baroda in the 223-run chase. If quick singles and breezy twos showed that he was back to full fitness, the rasping drives and lofted shots, peppering the ball across the ground, showed that he barely lost his touch. The swagger in shots was like a hit of adrenaline for the fans, with some even evading the security for selfies with him mid-match.

33,2025,The Hindu,33,"Sorry, but the captain’s apology is now part of the gamePremium Captains apologising for team failures is approaching the status of a cliché in the modern game. It is undoubtedly a noble gesture, this acceptance of responsibility. It is both theatre and therapy. It is good PR, and a way of restoring the bond between team and fan, a reassurance that disappointment is shared, and nobody hurts alone. Following England’s surrender in theopening Test of the Ashes series, skipper Ben Stokes said, “I could have been a lot better as captain. I wasn’t as clear as I normally am.” In India, Rishabh Pant saidafter losing to South Africa, “Sorry we couldn’t live up to expectations this time… we will work hard, regroup, refocus and reset to come back stronger and better as a team and individuals.” The captain’s apology, like the switch hit or data analysis, is an aspect of contemporary cricket. England skipper Douglas Jardine was unrepentant after the Bodyline series in 1932-33, while his fast bowler Harold Larwood was asked to apologise by his cricket board. He didn’t, saying he was following his captain’s orders (as an aside, this is an example of cricket’s class system where batters are the aristocrats and bowlers the plebeians). It is not unusual for defeated captains and players to feel they have let down their supporters and resolve to do better the next time. This is human nature. Some articulate their thoughts, others save them for their memoir, where time and ghostwriters allow them to settle on a happy choice of words. Nothing is permanent in sport. Not form or fortune, or indeed public affection. A captain who apologises too often becomes a caricature. One who refuses to apologise at all becomes a villain, while one who apologises just enough is mythologised for taking responsibility. Captains have to get the ‘just enough’ right.

They bring huge experience and skill. We’ve faced them for many years — some of us were still in school when they started. They’re world-class players, and we’ve been on the wrong end of their performances before, but we’ve also had good moments against them. It all makes the series more exciting,” said Bavuma on Tuesday. He also spoke about South Africa’s ODI roadmap: “We’re at a different stage in ODIs (as) compared to Tests. We’re building towards where we want to be. We may not have guys who go on to play over 250 games like India, but players like (Dewald) Brevis and Matthew Breetzke could get there over time. We want young players to get opportunities and see how well they fit into roles.” As for the loss in the first ODI, Bavuma stressed that the gap wasn’t wide. “We were only about 15 runs (sic) short. The fundamentals remain the same: start well, take chances when they come.

35,2025,The Hindu,35,"Marco Jansen’s all-round rise puts him among cricket’s most valuable assets Marco Jansen’s rapid evolution as a genuine fast-bowling all-rounder has given South Africa a rare two-in-one asset at a time when world cricket is short on pacers who can influence matches with both bat and ball. The 25-year-old left-armer, once viewed primarily as a new-ball prospect, has grown into a player capable of shaping sessions with the ball and altering momentum with his batting, making him central to South Africa’s long-term plans across formats. Jansen’s bowling remains his biggest currency — steep bounce, natural angle across right-handers and the ability to extract movement even on slowing surfaces have already earned him several match-shaping spells. His fuller length and improved control have added layers to his threat, pushing him into the leadership bracket of South Africa’s attack. Yet it is his batting progress that has elevated his overall value and offered balance the side has long missed. No longer a hit-or-miss tailender, Jansen now walks in with a clearer method, often rescuing South Africa from difficult positions or extending competitive totals into winning ones. “It’s always nice to walk in when the top five are on a roll. I’m just watching the ball and playing it as it comes. At the moment it’s working for me,"" Jansen said. His most compelling statement with the bat came in the recent Guwahati Test against India in November 2025, when he smashed a 91-ball 93 at No. 9 to pull South Africa out of trouble. Walking in at 334 for seven, he counter-attacked a tiring Indian attack with six fours and seven sixes, nearly becoming the first visiting No. 9 to score a Test hundred in India in more than six decades. His assault lifted South Africa to a formidable 489 — a total that shifted the course of the match and allowed their bowlers to control proceedings. The significance of the knock was amplified by the match situation and the fluency with which he scored on a slowing surface. This was not an isolated burst.

With India facing New Zealand in three ODIs from January 11 to 18, the 37-year-old is likely to play the first few games of the domestic competition. On Sunday, Kohli slammed his 52nd ODI century in India’s 17-run win over South Africa in the first game in Ranchi. With the former captain now featuring solely in the 50-over format, the fact that he will have limited game time in the lead-up to the 2027 ODI World Cup has been a talking point. After the win in Ranchi, Kohli, who now resides in London, said he has never been a big believer in a lot of preparation. “As long as I feel mentally I can play the game, I work physically very hard every day of my life, it’s got nothing to do with cricket anymore, it’s just the way I live.

""He’s played over 300 ODIs in 15–16 years, so the experience is inside him. It’s in his body and mind. Even if he arrived here after three days of rain, it wouldn’t have affected his preparation.

I work physically very hard, as long as my fitness levels are up and I am feeling well, it's good,"" said Kohli.

Now, with the action shifting to the Shaheed Veer Narayan Singh International Stadium in Raipur on Wednesday (December 3, 2025), the home side has an opportunity to seal the series. The two former India captains turned back the clock, entertaining a packed house while firmly addressing any questions about their future. Their 136-run partnership for the second wicket — the duo’s 20th century stand in ODIs — was a vintage exhibition of control and authority that sent the South Africans on an exhausting leather hunt. The assurance with which the two operated, their rhythm almost effortless, provided India with the perfect platform to set a daunting total. Kohli was in majestic touch, threading drives through the off-side with precision and punishing anything in his arc down the ground. Rohit, meanwhile, carried forward the imperious form he displayed in Sydney during the recent series against Australia. He unfurled his signature pulls, tackled the spinners confidently, and kept the runs flowing, steadily tightening the grip on the visitors. Their time in the middle, backed by immense experience and skill, felt like a timely injection of belief for a side still recovering from the drubbing in the Test series. Equally encouraging for India was the composed leadership of stand-in captain K.L. Rahul, who made all the right calls and contributed with a mature innings. The new-ball pair of Arshdeep Singh and Harshit Rana struck early with disciplined lengths, rattling the Proteas’ top-order while Prasidh Krishna chipped in with the key wicket of Corbin Bosch, who briefly threatened to pull off a heist.

40,2025,The Hindu,40,"From opener to No. 4: Ruturaj Gaikwad’s new role and India’s selection puzzle Ruturaj Gaikwad belongs to a rare category in Indian cricket: a batter who averages consistently above 55 in List A cricket. His elegance, tempo control and technical clarity have long made him one of the country’s most reliable 50-over batters. Yeton Sunday (November 30, 2025) in Ranchi, as he returned to India’s blue jersey after 16 months, Gaikwad experienced something he had never been asked to do before. In his 87th List A innings, Gaikwad batted at No. 4 for the first time. Until then, he had batted at No. 3 on just five occasions; every other knock was as an opener. His rise as a List A force has been built almost entirely on opening the innings. But with Shreyas Iyer still recovering from a lacerated spleen sustained in the final ODI in Australia last month, the No. 4 slot was vacant. When the squad was announced, the selection committee had labelled Tilak Varma, Rishabh Pant and Dhruv Jurel as primarily contenders for the spot. Nowhere did it indicate that Gaikwad — picked as a reserve opener — was in that conversation. What complicated matters further was that if captain Shubman Gill recovered from his neck spasm in time, Gaikwad would not even have been in Ranchi. He would have continued leading Maharashtra in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. Yet there he was — walking in at No. 4 in the den of his IPL mentor Mahendra Singh Dhoni, wearing a role he has never owned in domestic white-ball cricket. In doing so, the 28-year-old joined a growing list of Indian players being experimented with in untested roles under head coach Gautam Gambhir. India’s recent assignments have shown an unmistakable trend: frequent shuffling, unclear roles and little continuity. During thehome Test series loss to South Africa— India’s second home Test whitewash in 12 months — two different batters were asked to bat at No. 3 across the two Tests. B.

FIFA said Manuel Arias was “banned from all football-related activity for six months,” which will expire about four weeks before the World Cup kicks off in the United States, Mexico and Canada. Arias was barred from attending the World Cup draw on December 5 in Washington, D.C., which U.S. President Donald Trump is due to attend. FIFA said its disciplinary judges also imposed a fine of 20,000 Swiss francs ($25,000) on the Panamanian official for not complying with its ethics committee's previous ruling that banned him for six months into July. No details were given of how he breached the ban. Arias suggested Marta Cox was “fat” after she made critical comments about the setup at the national team, which qualified for the 2023 Women's World Cup.

44,2025,The Hindu,44,"Why India needs a cultural shift to promote simulation in medical learningPremium India’s healthcare system loses thousands of patients every year not to disease, but to preventable clinical errors - a problem the country rarely admits, but one every doctor encounters. Over the years, in my work in developing high-fidelity medical simulators and observing training behaviour across hospitals, I have seen a quiet shift: institutions are increasingly turning to structured simulation to close this dangerous gap. For decades, India has lived with a paradox. We routinely perform some of the world’s most complex surgeries, yet routine complications still arise from errors that have little to do with medical knowledge and everything to do with preparedness. Even the most dedicated young clinicians enter intensive care units and emergency rooms without ever having practised high-risk situations outside real patients. This is not a failure of individuals; it is a structural flaw in how we train our healthcare workforce. Most hospitals continue to rely on apprenticeship-style learning: observe, attempt, and learn on the job. But in disciplines such as trauma care, neonatal emergencies, obstetrics, and critical care, “learning on the job” often means “learning on the patient”. Predictably, hesitation in the first crucial minutes of a crisis, inconsistent procedural steps, and communication breakdowns become routine vulnerabilities of a system that depends on experience rather than rehearsal. Also Read:A powerful tool Patient safetycan no longer be left to chance. Across the country, clinical leaders are taking a quiet but decisive turn towards simulation-based training - a practice that has long been standard in aviation and defence, and is now becoming central to Indian medicine. This shift is not driven by technology for its own sake, but by the urgent need to standardise how teams respond to high-stakes scenarios. In simulation development, one sees how repeated drills change behaviour: muscle memory replaces panic.

Sheikh Morsalin scored the all-important goal for Bangladesh in the 11th minute to the wild cheer of the capacity crowd at the National Stadium here. The match, though, had been rendered inconsequential as both the sides were out of contention of the 2027 continental showpiece. India got a golden scoring chance in the 31st minute but Lallianzuala Chhangte's right-footed shot from the top of the box after Bangladesh goalkeeper Mitul Marma was completely out of position was headed away by Hamza Choudhury. There was an instance of pushing and shoving among some players of the two teams  near the touch line in the first half but the referee brought it under control. India's last defeat against Bangladesh was during the 2003 SAFF Gold Cup, where the latter had prevailed 2-1 at the same venue in Dhaka. Since then, the two sides had faced each other in nine matches before Tuesday, and India had won three times while six were drawn affairs. India's campaign for the 2027 Asian Cup had effectively ended on October 14, when they squandered a 1-0 lead to lose 1-2 to Singapore in Margao, Goa. By virtue of the defeat, a winless India remained rooted at the bottom of the four-team table with just two points from five matches. This was their third loss in the third round of the qualifiers.

The Argentine footballer will be here as part of what’s being promoted as GOAT Tour of India 2025, a privately organised event. From Kolkata, he will proceed to Hyderabad and then to Mumbai and Delhi. Mr. Messi last came to the city in 2011 to captain Argentina in a friendly match against Venezuela at the Salt Lake City stadium, the same venue for the upcoming event that will include a celebrity match and a masterclass. “This tour isn’t just an event; it’s a pilgrimage marking Lionel Messi’s monumental return to Kolkata, a city whose heartbeat syncs with his every move on the pitch. It promises to be absolute, glorious chaos, with thousands of us gathering to witness the living legend in the flesh, desperately hoping for a glimpse of that magical footwork, and a connection with the fanbase that has deified him for decades,” Apratim Majumder, a videographer, said. “Securing my spot cost around ₹5,500, but frankly, the financial aspect was completely irrelevant. As a fan whose entire mood is dictated by his match results, the thought of missing my idol in my own hometown was simply impossible.

Argentine superstar Messi scored once and provided the assists for all of Inter’s other goals, with Tadeo Allende scoring twice and Mateo Silvetti adding the other to send Miami into next Saturday’s Eastern Conference championship. Inter Miami will play host to New York City FC to decide a berth in the MLS Cup final after visiting City upset top seed Philadelphia 1-0 in the night’s other match. Argentine forward Maxi Moralez scored the only goal in the 27th minute to advance New York City, the 2021 MLS Cup champions. Third-seeded Miami will head into next weekend’s fixture brimming with confidence after laying on a performance of pace and precision to dispatch second seeds Cincinnati. Miami coach Javier Mascherano lavished praise on Messi and his teammates after a performance he described as near-perfection. “I’m proud of how the team played on a very difficult pitch against a very difficult opponent,” Mascherano said. “The players showed incredible character and played a practically perfect match. “It’s an honor and a privilege not only to manage Leo but this group of players. We know what Leo is capable of; he proves it every weekend. Today, he did another incredible job off the ball, because we already know what he’s capable of with it.” A sold-out crowd of just over 26,000 had packed Cincinnati’s TQL Stadium hoping to see the home side score an upset over Mascherano’s star-studded Inter team. But Cincinnati were made to pay for failing to take their chances in a bright opening, with striker Kevin Denkey forcing a good save from Miami goalkeeper Rocco Rios Novo after 15 minutes. Miami took the lead moments later when Messi picked out Argentine teenager Silvetti -- who had started instead of veteran Luis Suarez -- with an incisive pass down the left flank.

51,2025,The Hindu,51,"The delay of league season is not helping Indian football: Jamil The head coach of the senior men’s football team, Khalid Jamil, felt that the resumption of the Indian Super League season is imperative to check the slide of the national team in the FIFA rankings. “I feel the ISL should resume at the earliest. It is important that the players get the chance to play enough competitive matches,” Jamil said while addressing the media here on Saturday. “Development takes time, and we should have a positive frame of mind, which is necessary to ensure that everything gets back on track in time,” Jamil added. The Indian men’s national football team, which recently suffered its second successive loss in the group stage of the Asian Cup qualification matches, slumped to 142 in the latest FIFA rankings. India, which rose to the 99th position in July 2023 after winning the SAFF championship, encountered a steep decline in the rankings after it started the Asian Cup 2027 qualifiers midway in 2024. The Blue Tigers suffered a 0-1 loss against Bangladesh in its latest outing and thereafter slumped to its lowest ranking in nearly a decade. “The rankings are a reflection of the team’s performance over a period of time. The ranking does not always matter and what really counts is winning matches, for which, we must start working hard,” Jamil said. The National coach said it is time India broadened its squad by scouting talents from the youth teams and also by getting the Indian origin players from overseas. “We are thinking about inducting more under-23 and under-21 players in the national team. We will do the scouting once the ISL and the I-League get underway,” Jamil hailed the arrival of Ryan Williams under the OCI (overseas citizenship of India) and said that inclusion of more such players will help the Indian team.",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/the-delay-of-league-season-is-not-helping-indian-football-jamil/article70339552.ece

East Bengal, who had defeated Iran's Bam Khatoon FC 3-1 in their first game, can still progress to the quarter-finals if they avoid defeat with a margin of more than two goals against Uzbekistan's PFC Nasaf on November 23. The top two finishers in each of the three groups and the two best third-placed sides will make it to the knock-outs. Wuhan Jiangda's early pressure nearly paid off in the seventh minute when Deng Mengye burst through off Wang Shuang's through ball but drove her shot from the right into East Bengal goalkeeper Elangbam Panthoi Chanu. But the Moshal Girls conceded a minute later (8th) when Wang Shuang met Song Fei's cross from the left, tucking home the ball past a sprawling Panthoi. The pressure got to East Bengal when they conceded a penalty, following a VAR review, after Panthoi brought down Wang Shuang inside the box, with the 2018 AFC Women's Footballer of the Year making no mistake from the spot in the 17th minute. East Bengal had a chance to reduce the deficit, but Soumya Guguloth flashed her attempt over the bar in the 23rd minute, while Panthoi did enough to foil Mavis Owusu from advancing after Wang Shuang had slipped a well-timed through ball. Panthoi continued to frustrate Wuhan Jiangda in the second half with a point-blank stop in the 56th minute to deny Owusu before foiling Kim Hye-ri in the 61st minute following Deng Mengye's layoff. The East Bengal custodian continued to be a thorn for Wuhan Jiangda as she kept out Deng Mengye and later stopped Owusu in her tracks with a fine tackle in the 73rd minute.

Arsenal is the best team in Europe right now, no matter what manager Mikel Arteta says. A 3-1 win over Bayern Munich on Wednesday left Arsenal as the only team with maximum points in the Champions League after five games, while also ending the German club’s unbeaten start to the season in all competitions. “They had an incredible match against, in my opinion, the best team in Europe,” Arteta said of his players. “Individually we were immense to resolve all the challenges that this team brings to the table.” Second-half goals from substitutes Noni Madueke and Gabriel Martinelli gave Arsenal the statement win, after Jurrien Timber’s header was canceled out by a great team goal finished off by 17-year-old Bayern star Lennart Karl. That was the first goal Arsenal conceded in the competition this season. Just three days ago, Arsenal was celebrating a 4-1 win over north London rival Tottenham at Emirates Stadium. Next comes a visit to Chelsea, the closest challenger in the Premier League — albeit one six points behind in second place. “We are so pleased what we have seen, the energy we created in the stadium, what the team transmit, the energy that we bring, the quality we play with, it’s incredible,” Arteta said. “We have to maintain that because it’s still very early and unfortunately every three days you have to do it — that’s the beauty of it as well.” It was Bayern’s first loss in 19 games this season. Making it all the sweeter for Arsenal was Harry Kane, a former favorite at Tottenham, failing to score. “They are a top side … You see the difficulty of that (beating Bayern) and we managed to do that — in one game.

Bonds played 799 times for West Ham during a 21-year spell between 1967-88, captaining the East London side to FA Cup victories in 1975 and 1980. He managed the team from 1990 to 1994, twice leading them to promotion to England's top division. ""We are heartbroken to announce that we lost our beloved Dad today.

Chelsea midfielder Moises Caicedo was sent off in the 38th minute at Stamford Bridge for a crude foul on Merino that caught the midfielder on his ankle. Despite Caicedo’s dismissal, Trevoh Chalobah headed Chelsea from Reece James’ corner into the lead in the 48th minute. But Merino’s close-range header from Bukayo Saka’s cross in the 59th minute ensured Arsenal emerged unscathed from a bruising encounter between the title rivals.

Jurrien Timber headed Mikel Arteta’s side in front from a corner after 22 minutes only for Bayern teenager Lennart Karl to equalise in style before halftime. Arsenal dominated the second half though and showed their immense squad depth as substitutes Noni Madueke and Gabriel Martinelli scored the goals to make it five wins from five.

Curaçao finished as the only undefeated nation in the tournament and finished atop of Group B with 12 points to advance to the World Cup for the first time in its history. Curaçao got the historic result despite not having its coach Dick Advocaat on the bench. The 78-year-old Advocaat missed the crucial match because he had to return to the Netherlands last weekend for family reasons. Advocaat was at the helm of the Netherlands national team for three stints and managed South Korea, Belgium and Russia before taking the job with Curaçao.

Two more headers rattled the posts as Jamaica pushed in search of the winner, with Shamar Nicholson hitting the crossbar in the 70th minute and Bailey Cadamarteri the right post in the 87th. In stoppage time, Jamaica was awarded a penalty after substitute Jeremy Antonisse’s sliding tackle brought down Dujuan Richards in the area. But it was overturned after a video review. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics in Curaçao, the country has a population of 156,115 persons as of last January. Iceland, with a population of just over 350,000 was the smallest country to reach the World Cup when it qualified for the tournament in Russia in 2018.

66,2025,The Hindu,66,"No 2026 World Cup spot but China is experiencing a grassroots football revival Encouraging signs are emerging for China's long-suffering football fans despite the national team's failure yet again to qualify for the World Cup and the continued struggle of its top clubs in Asian competition. On the domestic front, the 2025 season has offered some positivity. The Chinese Super League comes to an end Saturday (November 22, 2025). If Shanghai Port, coached by former Australia international Kevin Muscat, can manage a draw in Dalian, it will retain the title. If not, city rival Shanghai Shenhua, which is in second place and two points behind Port, could take advantage. More than 60,000 fans are expected at Dalian to close a season that has averaged about 26,000 in attendance — the best among the top Asian leagues and higher than a decade ago, when Chinese clubs were spending record prices on world-famous stars including Carlos Tevez and Brazilians Hulk and Oscar, and coaches such as Marcello Lippi, Sven-Göran Eriksson, and Manuel Pellegrini. Now there are no international superstars in China's domestic top-flight and no clubs capable of challenging for continental honours. In recent years, Chinese football has made international headlines mostly for clubs folding under financial pressure. Yet the love for the sport remains. “There’s no doubt that a hardcore of football fans still exists in China, and the passion of some people remains undiminished by the last decade’s tribulations,” Simon Chadwick, professor of AfroEurasian Sport at Emlyon Business School in France, told The Associated Press. While Chadwick wonders whether the current upsurge can be sustained, optimism remains. “It is becoming increasingly apparent that the seeds of a new football age in China are beginning to sprout,” he said. The revival is not limited to professional football. Across the country, amateur regional leagues are thriving. The first was created in Jiangsu, a province with about 80 million residents that lost its CSL club in 2021 when Jiangsu FC ceased operations.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta assured a bench of Justice Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha and Justice Joymala Bagchi that the Government is committed to ensuring the tournament proceeds without disadvantaging players or clubs. Mr. Mehta said the concerned Union Minister was “fully aware” of the situation and had made it clear that “the ISL must be held.” He added that issues relating to financing, club ownership and operational arrangements could be left to the government. “We will ensure that players are not put to any disadvantage due to lack of sponsors or lack of club owners,” he submitted, while stressing that all steps would remain in conformity with FIFA regulations. The court, however, was cautious about the appearance of intervention. “We don’t want to put the impression that the government is again interfering. It is only to tide over the situation,” the Bench remarked. The judges added that the recommendations earlier made by Justice Rao would serve as “good guiding principles” when all stakeholders sit down for discussions. The hearing came amid reports referred to by advocate Rahul Mehra that several federation members were unwilling to pass the revised AIFF constitution in the General Assembly. The AIFF told the court that the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) called to adopt the constitution had been postponed to November 24. While Mehra insisted that “the meeting must be held” and the constitution adopted, the Bench said it was making no observations on that aspect for now. During the hearing, the senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, who was appointed amicus curiae to assist the court in the case, urged the Centre to engage with the clubs.

Arsenal took Bayern Munich's top spot in the standings with a 3-1 win, title holder Paris Saint-Germain romped to a 5-3 win over Tottenham with Vitinha scoring a hat trick, and Liverpool slumped to another loss at Anfield, 4-1 to PSV Eindhoven. The 26-year-old Mbappé scored three times for Real Madrid between the 22nd and 29th minutes, and again in the 60th, of a 4-3 win at Olympiakos. At age 17 — the same as when Mbappé was launching his Champions League career at Monaco — Lennart Karl and Viktor Dadason both scored Wednesday, and so did 18-year-old Geovany Quenda. Karl's exquisite first-timer for Bayern leveled the game in the first half but barely bothered Arsenal in a clash of the Premier League and Bundesliga leaders. It was Bayern's first loss this season. Only Arsenal now has five straight wins in the Champions League after Inter Milan lost 2-1 at Atletico Madrid, whose captain José María Giménez won it with a stoppage-time header — the 42nd and last goal on the nine-game slate. In Copenhagen, Dadason set the Danish champion on its way to a three-goal lead in a 3-2 win over Kairat Almaty. In Lisbon, Quenda opened the scoring in Sporting's 3-0 win over Club Brugge, spinning almost a full circle to hook a left-footed shot into the corner of the net. The exciting wing-back will join Chelsea after the season. At the other end of the age scale, 38-year-old David Luiz scored with a soaring header to help Pafos to a 2-2 draw with Monaco. He became the second-oldest scorer in the Champions League, behind only another veteran defender Pepe, who was approaching his 41st birthday when he scored for Porto two seasons ago.

72,2025,The Hindu,72,"Putin accuses European allies of sabotaging peace efforts on Ukraine Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Kyiv’s European allies on Tuesday (December 2, 2025) of sabotaging U.S.-led efforts to end the nearly four-year-old war in Ukraine. “They don’t have a peace agenda, they’re on the side of the war,” Mr. Putin said after speaking to an investment forum and before he met in the Kremlin with a U.S. delegation led by envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. Mr. Putin’s accusations appeared to be his latest attempt to sow dissension between Mr. Trump and European countries and set the stage for exempting Moscow from blame for any lack of progress. “They don’t have a peace agenda, they’re on the side of the war,” Mr. Putin said of the Europeans in comments to reporters. He accused Europe of amending peace proposals with “demands that are absolutely unacceptable to Russia,” thus “blocking the entire peace process,” only to blame Russia for it. “That’s their goal,” Mr. Putin said. He reiterated his long-held position that Russia has no plans to attack Europe -- a concern regularly voiced by some European countries. “But if Europe suddenly wants to wage a war with us and starts it, we are ready right away. There can be no doubt about that,” Mr. Putin said. Russia started the war in 2022 with its full-scale invasion of a sovereign European country, and European governments have since spent billions of dollars to support Ukraine financially and militarily, to wean themselves from energy dependence on Russia and to strengthen their own militaries to deter Moscow from seizing more territory by force. They worry that if Russia gets what it wants in Ukraine, it will have free rein to threaten or disrupt other European countries, which already have faced incursions from Russian drones and fighter jets, and an alleged widespread Russian sabotage campaign.

India, who had eked out a thrilling 4-3 win against the hosts Malaysia on Wednesday (November 26, 2025), scored through Amit Rohidas (4'), Sanjay (32'), and Selvam (54'), while George Baker (42', 48') netted twice for New Zealand. New Zealand tried to dominate the midfield in the opening minutes but the Indian defence held firm. India had their first real chance through a well-crafted move that resulted in a penalty corner in the fourth minute and stalwart Rohidas made it count with a ferocious drag-flick to open the scoring. India were denied a second goal after the New Zealand keeper deflected Abhishek's shot from close range, thus concluding a fast-paced first quarter. The Black Sticks showed a lot of purpose in the second quarter and even earned a penalty corner, but were thwarted by an alert Indian defence throughout the second quarter. India began the second half on the front foot and doubled their lead through captain Sanjay, who converted a penalty corner in the 32nd minute. New Zealand earned a couple of penalty corners of their own but couldn't break through the Indian defence. Pawan was sensational in the goal but his resistance was finally broken when Baker (42') helped New Zealand pull one back. New Zealand began the fourth quarter in search of their second goal, and managed to restore parity at 2-2 through a penalty corner with George Baker (48') on target. India struck back soon after as Abhishek's pass was neatly finished off by Selvam, helping the five-time champions retake the lead.

Binima added a third with a sharp run and finish, while Sonam scored a fourth after some neat interplay in the buildup, giving India a 4-0 lead after the opening fifteen minutes. With a healthy lead, India continued to dominate as Sakshi scored her second with a superb run that was finished off with a thunderous strike. Namibia showed some aggression to look for an opening but were constantly kept at bay by the Indian midfielders. India added a sixth as Sakshi converted her dragflick from a penalty corner.

It was a dominant performance from the host in all aspects against a team, which was a late replacement for Pakistan. But the only concern was the inability to convert penalty corners, especially the first 10 PCs. It was only off the 11th that India was able to score through Anmol Ekka.

India is a top team. And then let’s see what the other results in other groups are, because we depend of course on the results of the other group. But we definitely have the confidence that we can win the first two matches.” Levie said the practice matches in Chennai gave the team an idea of its strengths and weaknesses. “We drew with South Korea 1-1 and lost to Bangladesh 2-5. The defeat actually gave us a lot of new insights. We trust each other now and we know where our strengths are,” said the coach. Jens Flueck, the captain of the team, too, appeared confident.

Two more goals were scored in the following minutes through Jugraj Singh and Amit Rohidas in the 12th and 15th minute respectively.

Despite a 3-1 win over South Korea at the SDAT–Mayor Radhakrishnan Stadium on Tuesday that took its tally to six points in Pool F, the 1997 champion was undone by an inferior goal difference (-1) compared to other second-placed teams across the groups.

India started the game on the front foot, forcing the hosts back in their own half as they looked to assert themselves on the opposition. They earned their first opportunity from a penalty corner at the foot of the three-minute mark and built a sustained period of pressure that eventually paid off. A neat move from Sukhjeet Singh set up Selvam Karthi to score a tap-in, helping India take a 1-0 lead. From there on, they largely controlled the tempo of the game until a foul from Yashdeep Siwach resulted in a green card and a penalty corner for Malaysia. A deflection for the Indian keeper helped Faizal Saari level the score at 1-1 to end the first quarter. Determined to regain their advantage, the Indian forwards looked sharp and were attacking in waves as they dictated terms with a well-coordinated high pressing system. They managed to get back in front through a calm finish from Sukhjeet Singh after a shot from Abhishek came his way. India had a couple more opportunities to increase their advantage, but had to settle for a 2-1 lead at half time. India earned a penalty corner early in the third quarter as they pushed to double their advantage. However, they weren't able to make the most of their chances.

The two-time champion (2001 & 2016) can’t complain much as it has had the best preparations coming into the competition. As much as the Indian boys’, their head coach P.R. Sreejesh, too, will be under the radar for what he does and what he doesn’t. In his first major assignment, the 37-year-old legendary India goalkeeper and two-time Olympic bronze medallist, appears ready for the challenge. However, there are areas the Indian team should guard itself against. In the recently-concluded Sultan of Johor Cup in Kuala Lumpur, India could convert just eight of the 53 penalty corners it earned. Against Pakistan and Australia, it earned nine and eight PCs respectively, but converted only one. Sreejesh said the focus at the camp in Chennai was more on defence. “It’s an area where we gave more stress because we cannot concede a lot of penalty corners. In a tournament like this, every team carries a minimum of three to four drag-flickers, who are very good, which will be harmful for us.” Yes, seven-time champion Germany and former champion Australia are masters of the craft. In fact, in the previous edition in 2023, Germany’s clinical conversion of PCs played a big role in its title-win. Ian Grobbelaar is the star drag-flicker for Australia. He played a key part in the team’s triumph in the Sultan of Johor Cup. France, which ended runner-up in 2023, too, has prioritised penalty conversion this time. “We have a surprise or two in store for our opponents in PCs,” head coach Matthias Dierckens told the The Hindu.

Sreejesh said he expected more from the side’s attackers despite the glut of goals, ahead of the final FIH Junior Men’s World Cup 2025 Pool-B game against Switzerland here on Tuesday. Sreejesh had said he wanted his players to show a ‘killer attitude’ in front of goal after the 7-0 win against Chile in the opener. They scored 17 goals without reply against Oman. But the coach says there is more work to be done. “In this format, we need to have that kind of mentality [to score more goals]. League matches are open, and quarterfinal slots are allotted based on your goal average,” he said in a media interaction. Sreejesh was a mentor for the junior team during its title-winning run in Lucknow in 2016. From his experience, he says playing in front of a home crowd could be a double-edged sword. “When you are playing well, everything is great. The audience acts as your 12th man.

98,2025,The Hindu,98,"Junior hockey World Cup |Argentina in knockouts; Kiwis pip Japan Heavy showers halted the FIH Junior Men’s World Cup clash between New Zealand and Japan twice for more than an hour in the third quarter at the SDAT–Mayor Radhakrishnan Stadium here on Monday. Despite the long interruptions and a 1-2 deficit at half-time, the Kiwis staged a strong comeback to prevail 3-2. Later, Argentina confirmed its place in the knockout phase with a 3-1 victory over China, thanks to Bruno Correa’s  hat-trick. Argentina (seven points from three matches) pushed New Zealand to the second place by virtue of better goal difference (+5 to the Kiwis’ +3). New Zealand struck in the first minute when Scott Illerbrun slid in to push the ball home. Japan hit back quickly, Kyoya Toya unleashing a fierce forehand to draw level. Late in the opening quarter, Japan went ahead as Matsuki Mori pounced on a rebound off the goalkeeper’s pads and guided it home. Holding a 2-1 lead at the break, Japan returned for the third quarter looking assured. But the Future Black Sticks had other plans. With rain pouring down, it struck twice in the space of three minutes through Owen Brown and Jonty Elmes to turn the match on its head. Brown’s blistering backhand from close range left no chance for the goalkeeper. Moments later, Elmes collected a long pass from near the halfway line; his first backhand attempt was blocked, but he latched onto the rebound and lifted the ball into the roof of the net. For a while in the fourth quarter, New Zealand was reduced to nine players after Finlay Nealae (yellow card, 10-minute suspension) and captain Gus Nelson (green card, two-minute suspension) were sent off. Yet the side defended resolutely to preserve its slender lead. With its second win (seven points in total) from three matches, the Kiwis remain in contention for a place in the knockouts.

With a win and a draw from its two matches, New Zealand is on high. It still has to face Japan, which earlier scripted its first win, a hard-fought 3-2 result over China. Ranked 12 to Argentina’s three, the future Black Sticks played bold attacking hockey, thanks to a hat-trick by 21-year-old Jonty Elmes (his second in the competition). Given the fact that the team is funded solely by the players and their families, what it achieved on this day was heartwarming.

A brace each from Rosan Kujur and Dilraj Singh set up the host’s win. But it was Rosan’s two quick goals in the second quarter that opened the floodgates. Two-time champion Argentina made its intentions clear with a 4-1 victory over Japan in a Pool-C match. Argentina’s Nicolas Rodriquez showed his prowess in penalty corners by scoring a brace. It was a thoroughly commanding performance by the South Americans despite the brief dominance of the Japanese in the first half. If not for the good work by its goalkeepers, Kazato Baba and Tomoya Matsushita, Japan would have conceded more goals. Playing a fast-paced game, New Zealand got the better of China 5-3 in another Pool-C tie. Trailing by four goals in the fourth and final quarter, China fought back admirably scoring two quick goals through penalty corners. China, making its debut in the tournament, tried different penalty corner variations in the third and fourth quarters. However, the fightback came a tad late.

102,2025,The Hindu,102,"Junior hockey World Cup |Japan and Oman opt for the path less travelled In international field hockey, it is generally considered a rule of thumb that senior and junior national teams should have different head coaches. The demands of managing a senior squad — tactics, tournaments and process — rarely allow the same individual to simultaneously oversee a junior programme. The workload is excessive, and the developmental needs of under-21 players are fundamentally different. Two nations competing at the ongoing junior men’s World Cup here have opted for the path less travelled. Japan and Oman have their senior and junior men’s squads being coached by Yoshihiro Anai and Mohammed Bait Jandal, respectively. Anai acknowledges the intensity of the job. “It’s tough schedule-wise,” he told the The Hindu. “But it’s good for us. We can teach the same hockey principles to u-21 boys and to the senior team.” For Anai, the biggest advantage of this model is continuity. “Having one coach removes the wall — real or imagined — between the seniors and juniors,” he said. “We can bring young players into the senior team smoothly.” Japan’s campaign in Chennai, however, proved frustrating. The team led 2–1 at half-time against New Zealand before slipping to a 2-3 defeat in heavy rain on Monday, a loss Anai attributed to inexperience. “After the break, our players lost the plot due to lack of experience. We have eight debutants,” he said. His next target is clear: guiding the senior men to the podium at the 2026 Asian Games on home soil. “It won’t be easy with top sides like India, Pakistan and Malaysia,” he added. Mohammed Bait Jandal handles both the Oman senior and junior teams.

The 23-year-old Cobolli, roared on by frenzied home support inside the SuperTennis Arena, clawed his way to a 6-3 6-7(5) 7-6(15) victory with the third-set tiebreak one of the best ever seen in the competition's rich history. Both players produced some spellbinding tennis in a series of punishing rallies in the 32-point breaker with the aggressive ball striking of Bergs looking as though it would send the tie to the deciding doubles. But Cobolli, who also failed to convert his first six match points, would not be denied and eventually fired down an unreturnable serve to spark wild celebrations in the stands. ""In the five years I've been captain, I've never seen anything like it,"" said Italy captain Filippo Volandri. ""This match was incredible; in the end, it was 5 per cent tactics and 95 per cent heart."" Earlier, Matteo Berrettini powered past Raphael Collignon 6-3 6-4 to put Italy in front. It was Berrettini's eighth successive match win in the competition after he won all six he played last year, including doubles, as Italy retained the title by beating the Netherlands in the final. Italy will try to complete the three-peat in Sunday's final against either Germany or Spain who face off on Saturday. Should they prevail, they would become the first nation to win three successive titles since the Challenge Round was abolished after the 1971 event.

The Government of India has expressed its great appreciation of this very generous gesture whose significance is all the greater because Britain is making it at a time when its own economy is faced with serious problems. Apart from Sweden, no other aid-giving country, whether it is a Western or Soviet bloc nation, has so far accepted the concept of economic assistance to the third world as an international obligation. The signing of the four aid agreements to-morrow comes as the starting point for the implementation of the new aid policy of Britain which is based on the principle that all economic assistance to developing countries with a per capita income of less than 200 dollars should be given as grants instead of loans to help them achieve self-sufficiency within a reasonable span of time. Though Sweden is the only country which has been pursuing this policy, the grants given by it have been relatively small despite the fact that its economy can afford to bear much bigger burdens. But no big power, not even the United States, has so far subscribed to this concept though it has written off from time to time enormous debts that have accumulated over the years through concessional sales of foodgrains under PL 480 programme.",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/archives/from-the-hindu-december-2-1975-biggest-aid-to-india-from-britain-as-grant/article70344956.ece

The decision was recommended by doctors, he said. “I’m so sorry to announce that I won’t be able to play for Spain in the Davis Cup in Bologna,” Alcaraz said on X. “I have an edema in my right hamstring and the medical recommendation is not to compete."" He was hurt during last week’s ATP Finals and was diagnosed with muscle overload and swelling of his right hamstring. Alcaraz said he was returning home with a “heavy heart.” “I’ve always said that playing for Spain is the greatest thing there is, and I was really looking forward to helping us fight for the Davis Cup.” Alcaraz made his Davis Cup debut in 2022 and has a 6-2 overall record, 5-1 in singles. Spain’s last triumph was in 2019. He also didn’t play in the 2023 Davis Cup because of fitness issues. Last year, Alcaraz and Spain were eliminated in the opening round of the Final 8 at home in Malaga, spoiling the final match of Rafael Nadal’s storied career.

Nicola Pietrangeli, the only Italian inducted into the World Tennis Hall of Fame, has died,” said the FITP. Born in Tunis in 1933 to an Italian father and Russian mother, Pietrangeli was widely considered the country’s greatest ever tennis player until the emergence of current world number two Jannik Sinner. He was also one of the best clay-court players of his generation, with three titles in Monte Carlo and his home Italian Open tournament in Rome, where a court is named in his honour. In total Pietrangeli won 44 singles titles over his career, including his two triumphs at Roland Garros in 1959 and 1960, and reached the Wimbledon semi-finals in the same year as his second French Open title. An all-round sportsman, Pietrangeli played for football team Lazio until he was 18 years old, but he switched to tennis after the Rome-based club tried to send him away on loan. Pietrangeli’s first victory at Roland Garros was the first time any Italian player had won a Grand Slam and came after he defeated South African Ian Vermaak in the final. He also won that year’s doubles tournament, which back then was hugely popular, alongside his compatriot Orlando Sirola with whom he formed a formidable pairing. Gifted with an excellent backhand, precise ball control, and impressive stamina, he won his second French Open title in 1960 against Chilean Luis Ayala before being beaten twice in the 1961 and 1964 finals by Spaniard Manuel Santana. During the majority of his career tennis was divided between amateurs, who played in the traditional top tournaments and the Davis Cup, and professionals who joined a parallel circuit once they established a reputation as a top player.

Mr. Sengottaiyan had only two options: to either walk over to the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) or join the TVK.

The second-ranked Sinner beat top-ranked Carlos Alcaraz 7-6 (4), 7-5 for the ATP Finals trophy on Sunday in the sixth meeting this year between the two players who are dominating men’s tennis. Sinner defended the title before his home Italian fans for only his second victory over Alcaraz this year after also beating the Spaniard in the Wimbledon final. “It was an incredible season,” Sinner said. “To finish it this way, before my Italian fans, is very special for me.” Alcaraz had already secured the year-ending No. 1 ranking and was contesting his first final at the event for the year’s top eight players. Alcaraz still leads his career meetings with Sinner, 10-6. Sinner and Alcaraz have met in the last three Grand Slam finals. Alcaraz beat Sinner in a fifth-set tiebreaker to win the French Open; Sinner gained a measure of revenge at Wimbledon; then Alcaraz again came out on top at the U.S. Open. They also clashed this year in the Italian Open final (won by Alcaraz) and the Cincinnati Open final (won by Alcaraz when Sinner retired due to illness). “I hope you are going to be ready for next year because I will be ready to hopefully play more finals against you,” Alcaraz said during the trophy ceremony. To which Sinner added that he hopes they have “great, great battles ahead of us.” Sinner also won the Australian Open — beating Alexander Zverev in the final — so he and Alcaraz each won two majors this year. In all, Alcaraz has won six majors and Sinner has won four. Already early in the first set, the pro-Sinner crowd chanted its customary “Ole, Ole, Ole, Ole; Sin-ner, Sin-ner.” One fan even held up an image of Sinner depicted as a saint. Sinner saved a set point at 5-6 in the tight first set with a big second serve that Alcaraz couldn’t return. Then the Italian took control of the tiebreaker by running down a drop shot and responding with a lob that led to an overhead put away. “I’m extreme",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/jannik-sinner-beats-carlos-alcaraz-to-retain-atp-finals-title-before-his-home-fans/article70288587.ece
114,2025,The Hindu,114,"What Indian women’s tennis needs to bridge the gulf to the elitePremium There was a sense of pride around India’s campaign in the Billie Jean King Cup playoffs held in Bengaluru earlier this month. There were video messages from stars across sports — Sania Mirza, Rohan Bopanna, Mahesh Bhupathi, Veda Krishnamurthy, Abhinav Bindra, Anjum Chopra and others — wishing the Indian women the best. The heightened sense of anticipation was understandable, given that this was the first time that the BJK Cup playoffs were being staged in India. The Indian women had also come this far in the tournament for only the second time (the maiden playoffs appearance was in 2020-21). Even before Sahaja Yamalapalli, Shrivalli Bhamidipaty, Ankita Raina and Prarthana Thombare stepped onto the S.M. Krishna Tennis Stadium court for the opening rubber, there was a celebratory mood, a warm feeling that Indian women’s tennis had come a long way. This optimism was a cushion for the fall to come. On the court, the gulf in class was unmistakable. Against the likes of 2021 French Open semifinalist Tamara Zidansek, former World No. 58 Kaja Juvan (both from Slovenia), World No. 87 Suzan Lamens and top-200 player Anouk Koevermans (both from The Netherlands), the host came undone. Sahaja (World No. 307) and Shrivalli (World No. 394), who only get to face world-class opponents on rare occasions, managed to win just one set between them in four singles outings. Ankita and Prarthana fared better in the doubles, notching up one win and a loss. Despite the four losses, there were positives for Sahaja and Shrivalli. There was a noticeable zip in Sahaja’s groundstrokes, while Shrivalli came armed with two weapons so essential in modern-day tennis — a strong serve and a powerful forehand.

Slovenia, which posted its second win on Saturday, advanced to the Qualifiers round. Shrivalli Bhamidipaty and Sahaja Yamalapalli were outclassed in the inconsequential tie. The Netherlands fielded Anouk Koevermans, the third-ranked player in the nation, in the opening singles rubber against Shrivalli. Koevermans, playing instead of World No. 137 Arantxa Rus, showed no signs of nerves. The 21-year-old was full of energy, displaying fantastic court coverage. “I told the captain that I want to run down every ball.

According to the sources, the Army and Air Force, which already operate Heron Mk II drones, have placed additional orders while the Indian Navy is acquiring them for the first time. The Navy, which has long relied on Israeli-made Searcher UAVs for surveillance, will soon transition to the more advanced Heron Mk II platform. As per existing guidelines, under emergency procurement, armed forces can procure weapons systems, including entire systems, worth up to ₹300 crore. A senior Israel defence industry official, who was aware of the development, informed that UAVs have become central to modern warfare, with nearly 70% of battlefield operations conducted by drones across the spectrum, from frontline reconnaissance to deep-penetration missions. They play a decisive role against air defence systems, enabling detection, tracking and neutralisation of high-value threats. The Heron family, especially the Heron Mk II, has emerged as a key component of this evolving combat environment due to its versatility and proven reliability.

The first man to win 20 Grand Slam singles titles, and part of an era of unprecedented greatness with rivals Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic — during what Federer termed “a golden time for tennis” — he was the only candidate to receive enough support in the player category for the Hall's class of 2026. The Hall does not reveal voting results. TV announcer and journalist Mary Carillo, who also was a player, was elected in the contributor category. The induction ceremony is in August. “I’ve always valued the history of tennis and the example set by those who came before me,” Federer said. “To be recognised in this way by the sport and by my peers is deeply humbling.” Roger Federer plays a backhand against Kei Nishikori of Japan at Wimbledon 2019.

She said that President Donald Trump and his team “have been working so hard on this effort, and they all really want to see this war come to an end.” “Just yesterday... they had very good talks with the Ukrainians in Florida and now of course Special Envoy Witkoff is on his way to Russia.” Mr. Witkoff, a business friend of Mr. Trump who has become his roving global fixer, met Ukrainian negotiators on Sunday (November 30, 2025) alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio and again on Monday (December 1). The Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov said the talks “achieved significant progress” but that some issues remained unresolved. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, while trying carefully not to anger Mr. Trump, has refused U.S.-backed calls for Ukraine to cede hard-fought territory that Russia has not been able to seize. A U.S. plan, also presented to the Ukrainians a week earlier in Geneva without their input, would have seen Kyiv withdraw from its eastern Donetsk region and the United States de facto recognize the Donetsk, Crimea and Lugansk regions as Russian. The United States in turn would offer some form of guarantees to Ukraine, but the steps would stop short of Kyiv’s ambition to join NATO, the transatlantic alliance that considers an attack on one an attack on all. Washington pared back the original plan following criticism from Kyiv and Europe, but the current contents remain unclear. Mr. Witkoff has faced criticism in the past for his travels to Moscow, where he has entered talks without the usual professional staff that would be routine for U.S. diplomacy with the veteran Russian leader.

Krishna Tennis Stadium here. The duo dominated proceedings with two victories each, guiding Slovenia to the top of the group, and to the Qualifiers round as a result. Slovenia’s opening tie, against the Netherlands, was pivotal in shaping the final outcome. The winner of this match-up between the two best teams would be ideally placed to seal a berth in the next round. On paper, it was the Netherlands which was fancied. The Dutch had the highest-ranked player of the group in Suzan Lamens (World No. 87), and an experienced second singles combatant in Arantxa Rus (139). But Juvan (98) and Zidansek (162) flipped the script in grand fashion. Zidansek gave her side the ideal start, adjusting to bouncy courts in great style to dismantle Rus 6-1, 7-6(6). Juvan displayed tireless energy to wear out Lamens in a close encounter which went the distance. High on confidence after slaying the favourite, Slovenia made short work of host India the following day. Zidansek briefly dipped but found her rhythm to get past Shrivalli Bhamidipaty 6-3, 4-6, 6-1 before Juvan cruised past Sahaja Yamalapalli 6-4, 6-2. Zidansek’s recent success comes in a phase in her career when she just wants to enjoy playing tennis, without worrying about the results and rankings. Zidansek, 27, does not want to be hard on herself any more. “You are expected to be at your best every day, and chase points and go up the rankings and win every match. But that’s not reality. It is tough to be at your best all the time, physically and mentally. On the other side, normal life happens. You go through experiences and they make you stronger, and you gain a different view,” Zidansek explained. Tamara Zidansek of Slovenia in action against the Netherlands.

133,2025,The Hindu,133,"Another chance for India to break new ground India took a giant leap in the 2020-21 Billie Jean King Cup, when it made a maiden sojourn to the playoff round. Latvia, led by Grand Slam champion Jelena Ostapenko and top-50 player Anastasija Sevastova, put an end to the dream run. India now has another chance to break new ground, with the latest edition of the Billie Jean King Cup playoffs commencing at the S.M. Krishna Tennis Stadium here on Friday. The Indians - likely represented in singles by Sahaja Yamalapalli (World No. 309) and Shrivalli Bhamidipaty (World No. 381) - have a mountain to climb if they are to top the group and advance to the next stage. Two powerful rivals, Slovenia and Netherlands, stand in the way. Slovenia counts on 2021 French Open semifinalist Tamara Zidansek and Kaja Juvan (World No. 98), while Netherlands looks to Suzan Lamens (World No. 87) and the experienced Arantxa Rus (a former top-50 player) to get the job done. The Indians, however, have had a few big scalps in recent times. Only last month, Sahaja upset 2017 US Open champion Sloane Stephens in straight sets at the WTA 125K Abierto Tampico in Mexico. Shrivalli, meanwhile, consistently outplayed higher-ranked opponents enroute to five straight wins in the previous round of the Billie Jean King Cup. Ankita Raina, likely to be tasked with doubles duty alongside Prarthana Thombare, is not one to back down from a fight. “My best results have come when I have played for the country. It is a completely different feeling. Everyone is equal on the court,” Ankita said here on Thursday. Team captain Vishal Uppal appealed to the fans to provide a lift in spirit. “We need the Bengaluru crowd to come out and support us, and perhaps get under the skin of the opponents. That is what makes team competitions fun. I’ve experienced this when I played in the Davis Cup,” Uppal said.

134,2025,The Hindu,134,"Capturing urban dynamism in the 2027 CensusPremium The 2027 Census will be the world’s largest administrative exercise of its kind. The bedrock of India’s policy, scheme design, and fiscal allocations, the Census provides a snapshot of the lived reality of citizens. The 2027 Census will have dedicated mobile apps for digital data collection, geo-tagging of buildings, and a real-time digital monitoring platform to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the exercise. Capturing a comprehensive snapshot of the Indian populace requires another critical step: recognising transitional urban areas. According to official communications, Census 2027 proposes to retain the same definition of an urban area that was used in Census 2011 to ensure uniformity of comparison. However, India already has a comparatively conservative definition of what constitutes ‘urban’ with a threefold criterion: population size, population density, and economic parameters. It also follows a binary classification of urban and rural, which does not capture peri-urban areas that are often located on the peripheries of cities and in villages that are transitioning to urban in situ. For instance, studies by the World Bank show that even in 2010, the share of India’s population living in areas with urban-like features was 55.3%. However, Census 2011 recorded only a 31% urban population share, suggesting the existence of significant unseen and unrecorded urbanisation. The UN Statistical Commission has introduced a global method, the ‘Degree of Urbanisation’, for a clearer delineation of urban, peri-urban, and rural areas. The Census 2027 could adopt a similar intervention to recognise peri-urban areas that typically fall under rural governance, and could benefit from targeted attention for planned growth and provision of basic services. Delhi is set to be among the world’s five largest agglomerations (by population), based on UN estimates.

The Athletics Integrity Unit, which was founded in 2017 as part of track's response to the doping crisis, said it was the “last batch” of doping cases using data from the shuttered Moscow anti-doping laboratory, where cases were covered up. That evidence, along with findings from World Anti-Doping Agency investigator Richard McLaren, “exposed the state-sponsored Russian doping scandal,” the AIU said in a post on X. The Russian government has consistently denied wrongdoing. Working through that mountain of data has meant years of work for the AIU and other anti-doping bodies. They prioritised cases involving active and high-profile athletes, so the 12 named on Friday were long-since retired athletes or relatively obscure figures. The best known was arguably Elena Kotulskaya, the European indoor silver medalist in the 800 meters in 2013. The AIU's case document said Kotulskaya was banned for four years in relation to apparent cover-ups involving three separate positive samples from 2013. It said she didn't respond to formal notifications about the case. In cases spanning the whole range of track and field events, others among the 12 sanctioned on Friday included athletes from sprint events, race walking, jumps and a pentathlete. Four of the athletes had already been banned in earlier cases and for one, middle-distance runner Svetlana Karamasheva, it was the third doping ban of her career. The cases concerned doping cover-ups from as long ago as 2013 and involved various steroids and banned substances. Russia remains banned from international track and field over the invasion of Ukraine. World Athletics and the AIU have previously voiced concerns over how to ensure a level playing field on doping issues when Russia is eventually readmitted.",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/athletics/doping-bans-for-12-russians-in-track-and-field-cases-going-back-over-a-decade/article70255477.ece

Mr. Singh conferred the insignia of honorary rank of Lieutenant Colonel to the star javelin thrower, serving in the Territorial Army, at a pipping ceremony in New Delhi that was also graced by Army Chief Gen.

Born on December 24, 1997 in Khandra village in Haryana’s Panipat, he created history by winning India’s first-ever Olympic gold medal in athletics in the men’s javelin throw competition at the Tokyo Olympics 2020. Mr. Chopra continued his stellar performance by winning a silver medal at the Paris Olympics in 2024 and a gold medal at the World Athletics Championships in 2023. He has also secured multiple gold medals at the Asian Games, Commonwealth Games, and Diamond League events. His personal best throw of 90.23 metres (2025) stands as a milestone in Indian sporting history.

When the 27-year old steps onto the field for his fourth World para Athletics Championships at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here on Tuesday, he will be hoping to do something unprecedented – breach the 75m mark, something never done before in para javelin. Then again, no one had reached 70m either – before Antil did in 2023. “My big target from the World championships is to try and break my present world record (73.29m) and reach the 75m mark. A chance to compete on such a big stage at home may not come again for a long time and I want to do my best here. But it all depends on that particular day, a lot of other factors including conditions matter.

                                SHIV KUMAR PUSHPAKAR India won four medals on Sunday to wrap up its most successful outing ever at the World Para Athletics Championships, finishing with 22 medals on a dramatic final day that saw medals being upgraded and a sprint run again because of technical faults. Simran Sharma got silver in the 200m T12 clocking 24.46 seconds for a new Asian record. Simran, who initially finished third, was upgraded after winner Venezuela’s Alejandra Lopez was disqualified for violation of rule 7.10.4, which prohibits the guide from giving any undue advantage to the athlete. In javelin throw F41, Paris Paralympics gold medallist Navdeep Singh finished second behind Iran’s Sadegh Beit Sayah, who avenged his Paris disqualification with a new PB of 48.86m. Sandeep took bronze in the 200m T44 but there was drama in the 100m T35 when the starting gun fired twice but the race was completed. Technical officials took more than an hour to decide it would be re-run, Preeti clocking 14.33 seconds to place second. Meanwhile Saturday’s silver medallist Soman Rana was pushed to bronze after Brazil’s appeal to consider Thiago Dos Santos’ best throw as legal was upheld, giving him silver. The results: Men:100m T63: Puseletso Mabote (RSA, 12.03s); 200m T44: Marco Cichetti (Ita, 23.00s), Sandeep (third, 23.60s); 200m T51: Peter Genyn (Bel, 37.95s); 200m T64: Felix Streng (Ger, 21.60s); 800m T34: Yang Wang (Chn, 1:40.24); 800m T54: Jin Hua (Chn, 1:27.04); 1500m T38: Nate Tucker (Can, 3:57.98",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/athletics/world-para-athletics-championships-india-signs-off-with-four-medals-on-final-day/article70128518.ece
144,2025,The Hindu,144,"The greatest athletes will dominate any generation: Carl Lewis When Carl Lewis speaks, everyone listens. The man who retired from active sports in 1997 at the age of 36 with nine Olympic and eight World Championship golds across track and field events is in town as the international brand ambassador for the 20th edition of the Vedanta Delhi Half Marathon and did not hold back on a multitude of issues ranging from doping to improved sports science in an exhaustive interaction here on Friday. Lewis, now 64 and a coach at his alma mater University of Houston, was of the opinion that the best athletes are not confined to their generation and was categorical that the lure of social media had led youngsters to focus more on presentation than performance. “I would love to have run against a lot of generations. I would have loved to have run against Jesse Owens, Bob Hayes, Tommy Smith, John Carlos, Steve Williams. And then, of course, the kids now. Come on, I’d handle them. “The greatest would be the greatest; the ones that dominate a generation will dominate any generation. So I would love to run against Jesse Owens, just to say I did, but I wouldn’t want to run against Jesse Owens, because the guy was so much better. You think he wouldn’t be better now? “I was all over the place, I wanted to entertain on the track. But it never affected the core performance. Now, kids think that’s first and then the performance. It’s all about how you present yourself and asking for acceptance instead of performing and earning respect,” he declared. Lewis, who himself had to battle doping allegations before being exonerated by the authorities, also favoured forever testing. “I think the numbers are going up because the testing is getting better. I think we need to continue to test. The vast majority of people are clean and do the right thing. But I think until there’s the fear of forever, we’re not going to have it.

145,2025,The Hindu,145,"We are expecting more medals from athletics in Asian Games: Radhakrishnan NairPremium With the year 2026 a little over two months away, the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) has trained its focus on preparations for two mega events — the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, Scotland and the Asian Games in Aichi-Nagoya, Japan. India had bagged 29 medals in athletics, including three in 4x400m relays (comprising men’s gold and women’s and mixed silver), at the 2023 Asian Games in Hangzhou, China. The AFI has a target of improving the medals tally from track and field this time. A few months prior to the Hangzhou Asian Games, the country’s men’s 4x400m relay team had done creditably well. It hit the headlines with its Asian record-breaking performance of 2:59.05 at the 2023 Budapest World championships. However, at the 2024 Paris Olympics, the Indian men’s and women’s 4x400m relay teams crashed out in the heats finishing fourth and eighth respectively. The country has lost some pace in longer relays due to athletes’ injuries. The male runners are on the path of recovery and there is some hope. However, a few key female sprinters — including Jyothika Sri Dandi, Rupal Chaudhary and Subha Venkatesan — have been sidelined due to injury. Building a new team and making it perform at top level will definitely take some time. With India’s top sprinters hogging the limelight because of their fine performances since March, 4x100m men and women’s relays have been included in the priority list. The AFI is hopeful of a podium finish in the men’s section at the continental showpiece. As two athletes —National record holder Animesh Kujur and former National record owner Manikanta Hoblidhar — have gone below 10.20s in the 2025 season, the federation is confident of a good show in Japan. Gurindervir Singh is one to watch out for.

Saying that the dismissal of Ram Niwas from service cannot be termed “wrong or illegal”, Presiding Officer Kumud Gugnani, in her 66-page order last month, said: “Were India to compete with the leading economies of the day, she shall have to induce strict discipline in its workmen force”. She added that “the least that may be expected of the justice delivery department is not succumbing to the oft-repeated sentiment of showing empathy and compassion to the wrongdoer workman and thus breeding more indiscipline under the guise of beneficial legislation”. Making a prayer that his termination be declared illegal and the company be directed to take him back with full back wages, the claimant, through his counsel, argued that his name was not in the FIR lodged in connection with the violence on July 18, 2012 and neither his name appeared in the Special Investigating Team report nor the witnesses had taken his name in the criminal proceedings. He argued that he was dismissed without any internal probe and the company should have given him the opportunity to place his side of the case. The company responded to the claim saying that the workman was among those who had collectively participated in the violence. The court observed that “every person indulging in mob violence cannot be named in the FIR”, and it was “nigh impossible to hold separate inquiries in terms of acts of omission and commission on the part of the 546 employees likely to be discharged from office”. Of the 546 terminated workers, around 350 are fighting a legal battle for reinstatement and consequential benefits under the aegis of Maruti Suzuki Struggle Committee.

Shailendra Dwivedi, an Indore-based lawyer, filed a plea before the Judicial Magistrate First Class seeking directions for the police to register an FIR against Mr. Verma while alleging that his statement was “vulgar, obscene and cheap”. At a regional event of the M.P. Anusuchit Jati-Janjati Adhikari Evam Karmachari Sangh (AJJAKS) on November 23 in Bhopal, Mr. Verma had said, “Reservation should continue until a Brahmin gives away his daughter to my son, or (she) has a relationship with him, if it’s only about the economic aspect.” He had been appointed the new State president of the body at the event. Mr. Verma later apologised for his remarks and clarified that by “giving away” he meantkanyadaan(Hindu wedding ritual of giving away a daughter in marriage) and was referring to the‘roti-beti’culture between different castes, which promotes inter-caste marriages. However, his remarks led to various protests from Brahmin outfits and leaders who alleged that they were derogatory towards women as they demanded an FIR and disciplinary action against the bureaucrat. The State Government also issued a show-cause notice to Mr. Verma, saying that his statement prima facie amounted to “harming social harmony and creating animosity in the society” and fell under the category of “indiscipline and serious misconduct”. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Dwivedi said, “I come from the Brahmin community and am deeply hurt by Santosh Verma’s offensive statements about my community.

Saifi, who has been the visually impaired Simran's guide for over seven months, has tested positive for Drostanolone, a banned anabolic steroid that helps increase muscle mass, and strength. He won a 200m gold at the Delhi State Open on September 7 where this dope test was likely conducted. Saifi's name appears in the updated list of provisionally suspended athletes issued by NADA on Friday. He can appeal against the finding and seek a 'B' sample test. It is not clear why his name did not appear on the NADA website before the World Championships which took place from September 27 to October 5. Besides the 100m T12 gold, Simran also won a silver medal in the 200m race of the showpiece that was held in India for the first time.

Ekta, the defending champion in the F51 Club Throw category, managed a best throw of 19.80m in her final attempt to settle for silver behind Ukraine’s Zoia Ovsii (24.03m) but declared she was satisfied with her performance. India had 17 medals in the previous edition in Kobe. India added three more to its tally on Day Seven, including two medals – silver for Soman Rana in Shot Put F57 and bronze for Praveen Kumar in High Jump T64 – to remain fifth on the table while China overtook Brazil to go top with 41 medals so far. “The target was gold obviously but this is my third world championship medal and I am glad I could repeat my performance from last year. There was a little pressure both as defending champion and it being held at home but that’s the beauty of sports, you have to overcome your challenges,” the 40-year old said after adding a silver to her bronze (2023) and gold (2024) to complete her collection. Despite challenging, sultry weather conditions that made holding the club difficult, Ekta was happier for the fact that she her Paralympic dream was alive with LA28 including her event in the programme after it was dropped at Paris last year. Paris Paralympics gold medallist Praveen, who had a bronze at the 2023 Worlds before finishing an agonising 4th last year, added a second bronze with a season’s best jump of 2 metres despite a sore back that hampered his training.

159,2025,The Hindu,159,"Verstappen chasing perfection as he hunts down McLaren for possible fifth F1 championship Max Verstappen is chasing perfection as he pursues a fifth Formula 1 championship. After his dominant weekend at the United States Grand Prix, the Red Bull driver says anything is possible. “The chance is there. I think it is exciting, and I'm really just very excited for the end,” Verstappen said after his third win in four races. “I think we need to be perfect until the end.” 	In a season he once figured was all but lost, Verstappen now is hunting down the McLaren duo of Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris. And when he lifted the victor's trophy on the podium Sunday, it was clear that Verstappen has grabbed this title chase by the horns and may not let go. Verstappen's dominant run of late has trimmed his gap with front-runner Piastri from 104 points to 40 in a span of just four races. He trails Norris by 26. There are five races and two sprints left on the season, starting this week at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez in Mexico City, where Verstappen has five career victories. Verstappen would be just the fourth driver to win five titles. And he would join Michael Schumacher as the only drivers to win five in a row. After the race in Texas, Verstappen told the BBC: “We're just going flat out.” 	That should unsettle McLaren. McLaren already has won the constructors' championship thanks to its cars' dominance early on and over the summer. The pendulum has clearly swung toward Red Bull now, but McLaren can still bring it back. Verstappen knows the McLaren drivers still lead the championship and still have very fast cars. “We caught up a lot,” Verstappen said. “But at the same time, you know, the gaps (between cars) are very small.” 	McLaren doesn't want to show any cracks in confidence that one of its drivers can hold him off. Piastri, despite a miserable weekend in Texas with a crash in the sprint race and a fifth-place finish in the main event, noted he's still leading the championship, even as the gap is shrinking. “I'd still rather be where I am than the other two,"" ",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/motorsport/verstappen-chasing-perfection-as-he-hunts-down-mclaren-for-possible-fifth-f1-championship/article70187659.ece

Australian Piastri, who had started the race in seventh place and 14 points clear of the Briton, finished fifth after a late virtual safety car denied him a shot at fourth after a thrilling chase. Charles Leclerc was runner-up for Ferrari, 30.3 seconds adrift of Norris, while Red Bull’s reigning champion Max Verstappen took his sixth successive podium in third place after a nail-biting last lap left him just 0.7 behind the Monegasque. Norris now has 357 points to Piastri’s 356 with Verstappen on 321. “What a race. I could just keep my eyes focused and forward and focus on what I was doing,” said Norris, who was booed by the home crowd for reasons that remained unclear. “A pretty straightforward race for me which is just what I was after. A good start, a good launch, a good first lap and I could go from there.” Oliver Bearman was fourth for Haas in a career-best result for the Briton, who was 1.1 seconds clear of Piastri at a chequered flag waved by former heavyweight boxing champion Evander Holyfield. Kimi Antonelli was sixth for Mercedes, with teammate George Russell seventh and Lewis Hamilton eighth for Ferrari after a 10-second penalty dropped him from third. Esteban Ocon was ninth for Haas and Sauber’s Gabriel Bortoleto took the final point.

That year, McLaren drivers Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were seven and three points ahead of Ferrari’s Kimi Raikkonen going into the final round in Brazil. Raikkonen won the last race with Alonso finishing third and Hamilton seventh, and edged them out by one point. Similarly, in 1986, Nigel Mansell was six points ahead of McLaren’s Alain Prost and seven ahead of his Williams teammate Nelson Piquet.

Lewis Hamilton, F1’s most decorated driver, announced a shock move to Scuderia Ferrari, the racing series’ most storied and successful outfit. It was the biggest driver transfer of the 21st century, and the new alliance had all the potential for a blockbuster narrative arc: an all-time great seeking to clinch a record eighth title with the most passionately followed team on the grid before he bid adieu. Hamilton’s form had dipped since losing the 2021 championship in controversial circumstances, but he showed glimpses of speed in 2024, claiming two races after going winless in the preceding two years. Ferrari offered a fresh challenge, and nothing is bigger in F1 than winning a title for the Italian marque. Ferrari, too, was on an upward swing, coming within 14 points of winning the 2024 constructors’ title.

Japan’s Itsuki Sato made merry in the weekend’s opening race of the F4 India championship. It was a lights-to-flag win for the Ahmedabad Apex Racers’ driver on his maiden trip to India. It took some time for him to learn the lines but once he did, there was no looking back. “The car, the tyres and the track, for that matter everything, looked different to me compared to the Japanese championship. The Japanese surface has more grip but the one here looks very hard. So, it was a bit difficult for me,” said Sato. In the second round of the JK Tyre FMSCI National Racing Championship, Kolkata’s Mehul Agarwal of Dark Don Racing finished on top of the podium in both the races for the Formula LGB4 cars.

Norris of Great Britain secured his seventh win of the season in undramatic fashion, starting in pole position and finishing over 10 seconds ahead of Mercedes driver Kimi Antonelli of Italy, who finished a career-best P2 less than four-tenths of a second ahead of Dutch racer Max Verstappen of Red Bull Racing. With a 33-point showing in the event, Norris gained 23 points on Piastri, who finished in fifth and earned 10 points. With three races left, Norris is now 24 points clear of his teammate atop the standings (390-366). Verstappen, who surged from last place in the early going all the way to third in Sunday's race, is third, 25 points behind Piastri and 49 behind Norris. ""Just focus on yourself and the team,"" Norris said of his mindset as he added to his lead.  ""... McLaren are doing an amazing job, giving me a great car. We're pushing hard every single weekend and I'm pushing hard away from the track. So rewarding. It doesn't come easy, that's for sure. And to be honest, I don't think we were the quickest out there on track today, but glad to take home the win."" George Russell finished in fourth to remain fourth in the Drivers' Championship standings while Piastri finished in fifth place after he was assessed a controversial 10-second penalty for a collision with Antonelli which knocked Charles LeClerc out of the race.

174,2025,The Hindu,174,"The thrills and spills continue as title race vrooms towards climaxPremium The 2025 Formula One season title showdown has hit a crescendo as the bandwagon gets ready for a mad dash four-race sprint over the next month, which gets underway this weekend at Interlagos, in Sao Paulo, Brazil. While McLaren has long since sealed the constructors’ title, the drivers’ battle is now set to go down to the wire. What started as a two-horse race between the two McLaren drivers – Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri – has completely transformed since the season resumed after the summer break in late August. It seemed the reigning four-time world champion Max Verstappen would finally be dethroned, and his chances looked bleak post his home race - the Dutch Grand Prix. It was a pivotal moment in the championship when Piastri won his seventh race of the season on a day when his teammate retired due to engine gremlins, while Verstappen came home second. At that point, the Australian driver had a 34-point cushion over Norris and was a whopping 104 points ahead of Verstappen. However, since then, the picture has transformed dramatically as Piastri has undergone one of the most dramatic slumps in form from a driver in a championship fight, allowing his teammate to nose ahead by a point. More importantly, Verstappen and Red Bull have not stood still, forcing their way back into contention with three wins in the last five races, narrowing the gap with the leader to just 36 points. With four races left - there are sprint weekends in Brazil and Qatar, too - a total of 116 points are up for grabs, and the championship could go down to the final race in Abu Dhabi next month. F1 will consider itself lucky that what looked like a slightly underwhelming season for two-thirds of the way has sprung to life, and will keep all the stakeholders interested right till the end. Irrespective of who wins, the 2025 season has already become one of the most exciting the sport has seen, and there is a compelling narrative arc for the three title protagonists.

McLaren's Lando Norris could secure the crown in Qatar on Sunday but has teammate Piastri and four-times world champion Verstappen chasing 24 points behind, with 58 still to be won. Constructors' champions McLaren have assured their drivers equal status and Verstappen, who is on an impressive run of form and stands to benefit if they take points off each other, said that decision was 'perfect'.

""If you're a real winner and a racer, as a driver, then you go for it. I mean, even if you're behind. What's the point otherwise in turning up? Otherwise you can just easily label yourself as a number two driver. Which I think he doesn't want to be. ""Hopefully we can make it a great battle until the end."" Piastri earlier told reporters the subject of helping Norris to ensure McLaren's title double had been discussed and dismissed. ""We've had a very brief discussion on it, and the answer is no,"" said the Australian.

The Dutch driver is 40 points adrift of McLaren's Oscar Piastri, and 26 behind the same team's Lando Norris, with five rounds remaining. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, fastest in a sunny first session with nine rookies or reserves replacing regular race drivers in line with regulations to give them track time, was second on the overall timesheets but 0.153 slower. Verstappen had given up his car to up-and-coming F2 driver Arvid Lindblad for first practice, and the Briton looked after it well while still going sixth fastest — best of the non-race drivers. Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli was second and third in the respective sessions, with Norris fourth and 0.251 off the pace after sitting out the first practice while Mexican IndyCar driver Pato O'Ward took his car. Piastri was fourth in the first session and 12th in the later one. ""It was okay,"" the Australian said of his performance.

Russell crashed in Friday practice but turned it around in style as he was 0.182 of a second faster than Verstappen in Saturday's qualifying session despite clipping the wall. Verstappen was aggrieved with Norris' driving, suggesting it cost him pole. Verstappen has the momentum in the F1 title fight after winning the last two races, though he was unhappy with Norris' behavior on Saturday, while McLaren again seems off the pace. Standings leader Piastri qualified third, .366 off Russell's pace, with his McLaren teammate Norris fifth. Verstappen said Norris — who’s second in the standings — was “just cruising” around the track and disrupted a lap that could have been good enough for pole. “It’s noted, will be remembered as well,"" he said. Drivers tend to leave each other big gaps in the final shootout for the top 10 places but Norris was only a couple of seconds ahead, Verstappen said, arguing the disrupted airflow hit his performance. Verstappen said he would “just move forward” and wouldn't try to discuss the issue with Norris. “Sometimes it happens at a street circuit that people are bored, make mistakes,"" he said. Singapore is the only track this season where Verstappen has not won. “I hear this now the whole week, ‘Never had a pole, never won here.' Well, fantastic,” Verstappen said, saying previous Red Bull cars struggled to cope with a tight Singapore track where grip is crucial. “Now, finally, the car is a bit more all-round, it seems. We’ve always been, I would say, a little bit weaker on super-high-downforce (circuits), for whatever reason.

178,2025,The Hindu,178,"Norris held accountable for McLaren's scrap in Singapore that tightened up F1 title chase McLaren's scrap in Singapore has been settled. It's time to get the drivers back to chasing a Formula 1 championship. Lando Norris said Thursday (October 16, 2025) that the team determined he bore responsibility and the consequences for bumping into teammate Oscar Piastri at the start of thelast race in Singapore two weeks ago. The aggressive incident allowed Norris to snatch the early position and finish ahead of his teammate. And that shrank Piastri's championship lead to just 22 points over Norris with six grand prix and three sprint races left in the season. While no details were given on what “responsibility” and “consequences” mean for Norris going forward, both drivers said there would be no change to the team's “papaya rules” of racing heading into the United States Grand Prix this weekend. “We're very clear on how we want to go racing as a team,” Piastri said at the Circuit of the Americas. “And the incident we had in Singapore isn't how we want to go racing.” Piastri complained over the team radio during the Singapore race that by not ordering Norris to swap positions, the team wasn't being “fair"" to him after previous incidents when he was ordered to let Norris pass him. The episodes have raised questions whether the pressure and tensions of a title fight between teammates, and racing decisions, are starting to tear apart a tight-knit team that already clinched the constructor's championship. Piastri and Norris are both chasing their first F1 driver's championship. Norris said it was fair to be held accountable for a racing incident that favored him at the finish line, even though the team did nothing to correct it during the race and he wasn't penalized by race stewards. ""The simple answer is that there was contact between the two cars and that's something which we always want to avoid,” Norris said. “I didn't want what happened to happen.

AWS, or Amazon Web Services, said it will adopt a technology called “NVLink Fusion” in a future chip, with no specified release date, known as Trainium4. The NVLink technology creates speedy connections between different kinds of chips and is one of Nvidia’s crown jewels. The companies made the announcement as part of AWS’ annual week-long cloud computing conference in Las Vegas, which draws some 60,000 people. Amazon is expected to also show off new versions of its Nova AI model, initially unveiled last year. Nvidia has been pushing to get other chip firms to adopt its NVLink technology, with Intel, Qualcomm and now AWS on board.The technology will help AWS build bigger AI servers that can recognise and communicate with one another faster, a critical factor in training large AI models, in which thousands of machines must be strung together. As part of the Nvidia partnership, customers will have access to what AWS is calling AI Factories, exclusive AI infrastructure inside their own data centers for greater speed and readiness. “Together, Nvidia and AWS are creating the compute fabric for the AI industrial revolution - bringing advanced AI to every company, in every country, and accelerating the world’s path to intelligence,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.

Ilaiyaraaja over the use of his old songs in the two movies released this year. The compromise has been reached on payment of ₹50 lakh to the composer as a “commercial settlement and gratitude.” A joint memo of compromise filed before Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy on Wednesday (December 3, 2025) read that the Hyderabad-based production house had already paid ₹50 lakh to Mr. Ilaiyaraaja through Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) after deducting 10% towards Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) for having used three of his old songs in ‘Good Bad Ugly’ and two more in ‘Dude.’ Producers of Ajith Kumar-starrer Good Bad Ugly urge Madras High Court to vacate injunction in favour of Ilaiyaraaja Madras High Court bars use of Ilaiyaraaja’s songs in movie ‘Dude’ The parties had also agreed that the two songs used in ’Dude’ would continue to feature in the movie that is currently being streamed in an Over the Top (OTT) platform, but the producers would desist from using three other songs in ‘Good Bad Ugly’ in future. Yet, the money was being paid to the composer for having used those three songs until the court granted an interim injunction on September 8 this year. Mr. Ilaiyaraaja had also agreed to make a public statement regarding the compromise reached between him and the production firm. Represented by senior counsel S. Prabakaran, the musician had initially filed a civil suit against the production house for having used three songs, that were composed by him between 1982 and 1996 for three different Tamil movies, in ‘Good Bad Ugly’ without obtaining his consent. The court was told that Mythri Movie Makers had used the Tamil songOtha Ruba Tharenfrom the 1996 movieNattupura Pattufeaturing actor Sivakumar, the songIlamai Idho Idhofrom Kamal Haasan-starrer 1982 flickSakalakala Vallavanand the songEn Jodi Manja Kuruvifrom t",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ilaiyaraaja-and-producers-of-tamil-movies-good-bad-ugly-dude-reach-compromise-after-payment-of-50-lakh/article70353047.ece

192,2025,The Hindu,192,"SC turns spotlight on glitches in pay-outs, free critical care to acid attack victims The Supreme Court on Wednesday decided to look into a plea that acid attack survivors, mostly young women, have neither been paid in full the minimum ₹3 lakh in victim compensation nor provided free critical care by private hospitals. A Bench headed by Justice B.V. Nagarathna decided to examine what ails the disbursement of victim compensation to acid attack survivors despite repeated judicial orders from the top court spanning years. The court had in 2006 taken judicial cognisance of the trauma undergone by acid attack victims after witnessing and hearing Laxmi, who was ambushed by a trio of men, one of whom she had refused to marry. Laxmi was 15 years old at the time. The top court had ordered States to pay victims a minimum ₹3 lakh compensation, of which ₹1 lakh was to be given within 15 days of the incident and the balance within two months. The court had banned over-the-counter sale of acid. It had declared that private hospitals would be held criminally liable for refusing free treatment to victims before referring them to a specialised facility. Free medical treatment included medicines, bed and food besides physical treatment to victims of acid attacks. These directions were passed in judicial orders in 2013 and reiterated by the top court in 2015. In April 2015, the court had directed that district legal services authorities would function as criminal injuries compensation boards and take up the compensation claims made by acid attack victims. On March 20 this year, the Supreme Court gave acid attack victims liberty to approach the State or district legal services authorities or legal services committee in case there was any default or delay in payment of compensation from the States. The legal services bodies were asked to maintain records of the names and details of acid attack victims, the dates of application for compensation and payment. These statutory bodies, dedicated to providing free legal services to weaker sections of society, were also ordered ",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-turns-spotlight-on-glitches-in-pay-outs-free-critical-care-to-acid-attack-victims/article70353134.ece

202,2025,The Hindu,202,"Land and alignment issues stall 105 ROB projects in Kerala While Ministry of Railways has sanctioned a total of 127 ROB (Road Over Bridge) projects in Kerala, 105 of these projects are yet to be commenced due to delays in land acquisition and finalising alignment. In response to a question raised by Kodikunnil Suresh MP at Lok Sabha, the Ministry has informed that as of November 1, 2025, 127 ROBs have been sanctioned across railway tracks in Kerala, covering the Thiruvananthapuram, Madurai, and Palakkad Divisions, with projects currently in various stages of planning and execution. Of these, 106 works are sanctioned on a cost-sharing basis, while 21 works are financed entirely by the Railways. Delays in the 105 ROB projects are primarily attributed to issues from the State government. “Urgent coordination between the Railways and the State government is essential to address the massive delay in ROB projects in Kerala. This slowness is hampering key infrastructure works in the State. The fact that only two ROB/RUB projects have been completed in the current financial year up to October 2025 underscores the urgency for quick intervention,” said Mr Suresh. The Ministry observed that the completion and commissioning of ROB works are dependent on various factors including the cooperation of State governments in providing consent for the closure of Level Crossings (LCs), fixing the approach alignment, approval of the General Arrangement Drawing (GAD), land acquisition, removal of encroachment, shifting of infringing utilities, obtaining statutory clearances from various authorities, the law and order situation in the project sites, and the duration of the working season available in a year for the particular project due to climatic conditions. Among the 105 ROB projects, there are 37 cases where land acquisition was delayed while 63 cases are awaiting finalisation of alignment by State government. Two projects were stalled due to public protests and court cases and in three cases agency is yet to be fixed. “The long-term delays i",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/land-and-alignment-issues-stall-105-rob-projects-in-kerala/article70353110.ece

205,2025,The Hindu,205,"Studying in Canada: Rising costs, stricter requirementsPremium Canada’s 2025 immigration settings reshaped student routes, family work rights and early-career transitions. The signal was clear: align international education with labour needs and housing capacity while keeping credible paths into work. The outcome affects India’s outbound pipeline, university planning and employer hiring in 2026. Ottawa kept a national issuance target of a little over four hundred thousand study permits and required most applicants to include a Provincial or Territorial Attestation Letter that confirms a seat within the cap. Allocations were set by province and by cohort, including a defined share for graduate students. Financial readiness moved as well. From September 1, 2025, the living-expense minimum outside Québec is CAD 22,895 for a single applicant, higher if applying with family. Family work access narrowed. From January 21, 2025, only spouses of certain international students and specific foreign workers remain eligible for an open work permit under IRCC’s measure; dependent children are not eligible under this policy. Post-graduation pathways were tuned to labour alignment. IRCC introduced a field-of-study requirement tied to eligible CIP codes for PGWP. After removing some fields on June 25, the department restored them on July 4 and extended their eligibility until early 2026 while the table is refined. Applicants and institutions must now check the live CIP list. Canada targets under 5% temporary residents by the end of 2027, with controlled intake through 2026. Permanent routes are being calibrated, too. IRCC confirmed category-based selection in Express Entry for 2025, with a new Education category and a stated focus on inviting more candidates with Canadian work experience through the Canadian Experience Class. The direction ties selection to defined labour goals and in-country experience. Labour demand looks mixed.

210,2025,The Hindu,210,"What to expect at No Name Chennai the new multi-level resto bar on Chamiers Road The German language is known for having compound words that describe nuanced feelings. One such word is gemütlichkeit, which is used to convey a feeling of warmth, friendliness, and good cheer. While Tamil is one of the oldest languages in the world, this feeling is difficult to name in a single word. So what does one do when a newly opened resto bar evokes these feelings of warmth and good cheer? Give it no name! Second floor space

                                Special Arrangement Chennai’s latest addition to the nightlife scene is No Name on Chamiers Road. A four-level resto bar it blends the breezy vibe of a Bengaluru microbrewery with gourmet food and cocktails that bring out the essence of the city. It aims to close a gap in the scene which relies on the arrival of weekends to head out and have a drink. “In Chennai, the party scene is mostly Friday and Saturday. But in cities like Bengaluru, even on a Tuesday you’ll see 300 people having a meal and a beer. There are no weekends there. I wanted to bring that culture to Chennai,” says Hari Chandran, founder and owner of No Name. Brought to life by designers Daphne Dmello and Nirali Bathia from Studio Kaleidoscope, each floor at No Name comes with a vibe of its own. The first floor opens into a dance-floor with a full bar. Stained-glass windows, paintings akin to the Sistine chapel behind the bar, and chandeliers hanging low make it a tricky dance floor to let loose in, but the city will sin nevertheless, for it has been deprived of a good dance floor. As we climb to the second floor, the vibe changes completely. Floor to ceiling windows overlooking greenery, low sofas and comfortable seats, the aroma of Thai curry. The last two floors are where No Name channels its inner Bengaluru. Open terrace, hanging fabric lamps, seats, and tables carved out of stone and an easy setup that can accommodate open mics, live music gigs and more.

Uncertainty over the India-U.S. trade deal, along with the lack of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) effort to stop the slide in the local unit, put further pressure on the rupee, according to forex traders. At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened at 89.96 against the U.S. dollar and fell to a record intraday low of 90.30 during the session before closing at a new all-time low of 90.21 (provisional), down 25 paise from its previous close. On Tuesday (December 2, 2025), the rupee settled 43 paise down at a lifetime low of 89.96 against the U.S. dollar, largely owing to continued short-covering from speculators and sustained importer demand for the American currency. “The rupee hit a fresh all-time low of 90.30 amid selling pressure from foreign investors and a surge in crude oil prices. Uncertainty over the announcement of India-US trade deal has also weighed on the rupee. However, a weak U.S. dollar index prevented a sharp fall,” Anuj Choudhary, Research Analyst, Mirae Asset ShareKhan, said. “We expect the rupee to trade with a slight negative bias on persistent FII outflows and higher crude oil prices. However, a weak dollar and rising odds of a rate cut by the Fed in December may support the rupee at lower levels,” he said, adding that the USD-INR spot price is expected to trade in a range of ₹89.80 to ₹90.50. “The rupee was easily allowed by the RBI to cross 90, and it even fell to 90.30 before the RBI stepped in,” Anil Kumar Bhansali, Head of Treasury and Executive Director, Finrex Treasury Advisors LLP, said.

Like chess, shooting too is a lonely sport. It was the first game of the final of what is one of the biggest events in the mind game’s calendar, and India’s first-ever individual gold medallist at the Olympics made the first move for Javokhir Sindarov, taking the ‘e’ pawn two squares forward at Resort Rio. A little earlier, while talking to reporters, the articulate Bindra had said that he was more of a follower of chess players and than the game itself. For the game’s followers, who are growing in numbers rapidly in India, there may not have been too much excitement in the final’s first encounter. But it had its moments before Wei Yi and Sindarov decided to split the point after 50 moves; the opposite-coloured bishop ending This was the first time ever that Wei and Sindarov were coming face to face in the classical format. The Chinese, not for the first time here, opted for Petrov’s Defence, and managed to create a promising position, but he didn’t really press, as he opted to capture the knight instead of a pawn, taking which would have given him more to play for. The stakes are high in the other match, too. And Andrey Esipenko, after making that terrible blunder against Wei that cost him a place in the Candidates, should be feeling better. The Russian beat Nodirbek Yakubboev to take a 1-0 lead in the third-place playoff. This time, playing from the white side of a Sicilian Defence (Four Knights), he was the beneficiary of some weak moves under time pressure from his opponent, in a rook-and-minor-piece ending. The Uzbek resigned on the 38th move, when he was about to lose his knight.

220,2025,The Hindu,220,"Excise duty to ensure tax incidence on tobacco remains same after GST cess ends: Sitharaman Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday (December 3, 2025) said the levy of excise on tobacco will ensure that incidence of tax on the demerit good remains same even after the expiry of the GST compensation cess. Movingthe Central Excise (Amendment) Bill, 2025, for discussion and passage in the Lok Sabha, the Finance Minister said since the GST law caps maximum rate of tax at 40%, the ultimate tax incidence on tobacco after removal of GST cess would come down from the current level if excise duty is not levied. “In order to ensure that the incidence is not lower than what it was during GST with the compensation cess, we are bringing this excise. In a way we are saying cigarettes should not become affordable now because incidence has become lesser,” the Minister said. The bill proposes to replace the GST compensation cess which is currently levied on all tobacco products like cigarette, chewing tobacco, cigar, hookah, zarda, and scented tobacco. Currently, a 28% GST plus cess at varied rate is levied on tobacco. The bill proposes to levy excise duty of 60-70% on unmanufactured tobacco. The excise duty on cigars and cheroots is proposed at 25% or ₹5,000 per 1,000 sticks, whichever is higher. Cigarettes, not having filters, and of length not over 65 millimetres will attract duty of ₹2,700 per 1,000 sticks and ₹4,500 per 1,000 sticks for length over 65 millimetres but not exceeding 70 millimetres. The Finance Minister further said the bill was necessary as the loan taken to meet the revenue loss of states during Covid will be repaid in a “couple of weeks”, post which the compensation cess will cease to exist. “In another, probably, couple of weeks the loans will be completely repaid.  The Centre, therefore, wants to make sure that the excise will come back to us so that we can levy the duty,” Ms. Sitharaman said.

This was Srikanth’s second runner-up finish this year on the tour, and the more painful one, given he was within reach of the title despite an early reversal in the first game. The much younger Gunawan was quickly off the mark and made full use of his superior physicality and strength in the initial stage for a 21-16 win, even as Srikanth tentatively probed around for his opponent’s weaknesses and his own rhythm. He found it in the second game, relying more on strategic placement, deception at the net and experience to preserve his energy and raise his game only when needed. The result was a one-sided 21-8 win to take the match into the decider. There was everything to play for, and the two stayed close before Srikanth opened up a three-point lead twice, first at 14-11 and then at 17-14. But Gunawan was relentless and closed the gap before Srikanth went a little too wide. Treesa-Gayatri duo, meanwhile, was taken by surprise by the Japanese pair and was found wanting with gaps in its defence and errors before overhauling its game. The Indians became a lot more attacking and quicker, especially Treesa at the back with her smashes and Gayatri covering the fore court. The increased pace and quick returns rattled the opposition, often leaving them undecided. Osawa and Tanabe tried to keep the shuttle in play more with longer rallies going their way, but the Indians managed to fight through to win 17-21, 21-13, 21-15.

223,2025,The Hindu,223,"Chess World Cup | India and Uzbekistan to fight for Olympiads and other titles in next 10 years: Sindarov Javokhir Sindarov just couldn’t stop smiling. Or laughing. The 19-year-old’s excitement on Wednesday night was understandable. He had just won the Chess World Cup, after beating Wei Yi in the final that had gone to the nerve-wracking tie-break, after both the classical games were drawn at Resort Rio. His Chinese rival, seeded seventh (that is nine slots above him), had displayed strong nerves, and strong chess too, right through the gruelling knock-tournament. But, a terrible error in the second tie-break game gave Sindarov a golden chance, which he wasn’t going to miss, having done that in the first. The Uzbek teen, who became a Grandmaster at 12, is the youngest champion in World Cup history. But, he has already set bigger goals. “I am very happy for sure, but it is only the start of my chess career, and I need to cross 2750 Elo points first,” Sindarov said. “And of course it is my dream to win the Candidates tournament and thus play for the World title.” And if does that, his opponent will be D. Gukesh, the defending champion. Before that at the Candidates, he could be playing another Indian contemporary of his, R. Praggnanandhaa, who is most likely to qualify as the winner of the FIDE Circuit. “The Indian players grew in strength very fast,” said Sindarov. “We have strong players back in Uzbekistan, too. Yes, I think India and Uzbekistan will be fighting for the Chess Olympiad and a lot of other tournaments in the next 10 years.” India has been a happy hunting ground for Sindarov. He was part of the Uzbekistan team that won the Chennai Olympiad in 2022 with a performance that far exceeded the expectations. Little wonder, he is looking forward to coming back to India. “I will be playing at the Global Chess League and Tata Steel Chess India (over the next couple of months),” he said.",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/chess-world-cup-india-and-uzbekistan-to-fight-for-olympiads-and-other-titles-in-next-10-years-sindarov/article70330147.ece

With two big wins under his belt including against H.S. Prannoy in the second round of the Syed Modi India international on Thursday to reach the quarterfinals, the 20-year old has been one of the most impressive youngsters so far. The range of strokes and aggressive play he brings on court, however, is replaced by a tongue-tied kid still relishing the experience off it. “Mujhe to unke sath khel ke hi khushi mil gayi thi, wo bahut bade player hain aur mere se bahut zyada experienced, jeet ke to aur bhi achha lag raha hai (I was happy simply playing against him, he is a very big player and a lot more experienced than me, winning against him feels even better),” was all he could say after his win against Prannoy, the biggest of his fledgling career. A Faridabad resident who started playing after accompanying his father and elder brother to the badminton courts, Manraj has been training with Sagar Chopra at the Prakash Padukone Badminton Academy for the past two years. Great opportunity “It has been a great learning opportunity and you get a lot of good sparring partners. Before that, I trained with Anshul Mehta and Ashok Mehta locally. At the junior level, I was advised by my coach to focus only on that and develop my game and not mix things with the senior circuit, unlike many others. I have been playing at the senior level only after turning 18 which is why there are so few tournaments against my name. This is only my third Super 300 event, all this year only,” he explained. Against Prannoy, Manraj was incessant with his attack, relying on his height and kept pushing the senior pro hard without giving him a chance to take control. It was the same against S.

From October 1, one of India’s most famous badminton centres, where the likes of P. Gopichand and Saina Nehwal once trained and now P.V. Sindhu and Lakshya Sen continue to spruce up their games, has been re-christened Centre for Badminton Excellence (CBE) after Padukone decided to step down. Founded in 1994 by the trio of Padukone, former National champion and Dronacharya awardee U. Vimal Kumar, and industrialist and sports promoter Vivek Kumar, the erstwhile PPBA trained India’s elite and was one of the country’s National badminton centres. With Padukone now focusing his energies on the Padukone School of Badminton (PSB), an entrepreneurial venture with daughter Deepika, Vimal and Vivek will be fully in charge of the CBE. The sprawling Padukone-Dravid Centre for Sports Excellence on the city’s outskirts, which housed the erstwhile PPBA, will now have both the CBE and a unit of the PSB under one roof. “Prakash had been indicating it for a while and he wanted to move away from the excellence side towards school training,” Vimal toldThe Hinduon Tuesday. “But the players, the coaches all remain the same.” “It is a bit nostalgic for me. We were among the first private academies to be set up in 1994. We just named it after Prakash because no other name was required. “We have grown a lot since then and have better facilities.

The Indian men’s basketball team will look to avoid a third straight competitive defeat against Saudi Arabia when the two teams face off in the FIBA World Cup 2027 Asian Qualifiers Group D match at the Jawaharlal Nehru Indoor Stadium here on Sunday. India will also be seeking a first-ever win against the Middle East nation, having lost all six previous meetings, including its opening qualifying clash 51-75 on Thursday. While he has often described his side as a “shooting team”, India head coach Scott Flemming conceded that a big chunk of India’s troubles in the previous game came from its offensive forays, which were well below par. Out of 71 field goal attempts (excluding free throws), India successfully passed the ball through the rim only 19 times, while its opponent managed 28 from 56 tries. “One of our strengths is hitting threes, but we could not throw it in the basket the other night. Hopefully, it won’t happen again, because I think if we had knocked down half of those threes, we would have been right in the game,” Flemming said. In terms of squad composition, Flemming retained a core group of eight players that travelled for the Asia Cup to Saudi Arabia in August, while also bringing in fresher faces like Baladhaneshwar Poiyamozhi, Aravind Annadurai and veteran Amjyot Singh Gill, who is back from an injury.

Kanwar Gurbaz Singh Sandhu was the top performer for the host with 19 points while Muhammad Ali Abdur-Rahkman led Saudi’s charts with 24. Despite head coach Scott Flemming highlighting the need to be clinical in attack ahead of the game, India lacked precision in the opposition half, scoring only 22 of 76 field goal attempts. In contrast, Saudi managed 30 off 62 to hand India its second defeat in as many games in the competition. Both teams set off with an aggressive purpose, but it was the visitor that took an early hold on the game, with forward Ali Shubayli scoring eight points to give his side a 10-point lead after the first quarter. Sandhu’s three-pointer from the corner, midway through the second period, momentarily lifted the spirits of the home supporters, but Saudi Arabia’s Abdur-Rahkman kept draining baskets with regularity at the other end to take the game away. India improved ever so slightly in the second half and slowly chipped away at Saudi’s lead, with Harsh Dagar sinking a couple of baskets early in the third quarter. However, the players eventually ran out of steam, and Saudi once again reasserted its dominance, with Fahad Belal plunging a dagger three-pointer in the third quarter to extend the lead to 33 and practically put the game to bed. The result leaves India reeling at the bottom of its group with two points with four matches left to play.

He had started as the 59th seed, and was just 18 then. The Russian will be defending his crown at this year’s World Rapid Championship, beginning in Doha on December 26. Before that though, he will be playing at the third edition of the Global Chess League, to be held in Mumbai from December 13. This is his Murzin’s second league; last year he had played for Ganges Grandmasters. This time he is representing American Gambits. And he is glad to be part of the team headlined by the World No. 2 Hikaru Nakamura. “I am delighted that I am playing for American Gambits and we have an excellent team,” Murzin toldThe Hinduover the phone from Moscow. “We have the team to win the title this time and that is what we will be aiming for.

Srikanth moved closer to his maiden World Tour title this year, entering the final of the Syed Modi India International 2025 with a jittery three game win against Mithun Manjunath here on Saturday to be the host’s last remaining singles hope in the tournament. Srikanth won 21-15, 19-21, 21-13 against his younger counterpart in just under an hour to set up a title clash with Jason Gunawan of Hong Kong. The latter survived a scare against unheralded Minoru Koga of Japan, losing the first game before recovering to dominate the second, reeling off 14 straight points and leading 11-0 in the decider before Koga withdrew. Treesa Jolly and Gaytri Gopichand, meanwhile, stayed on course to defend their title with an easy 21-11, 21-15 win against the Malaysian pair of Xin Yee Ong and Carmen Ting, dominating from the start and keeping control of the match all through. Unnati Hooda and Tanvi Sharma lost their respective semifinals to bow out of the competition in similar fashion, unforced errors and inconsistency taking their toll. While Tanvi lost to Japan’s Hina Akechi 21-17, 21-16, Unnati went down to Neslihan Arin of Turkey 21-15, 21-10. “There were a lot of mistakes made and I still have a lot of work to do in my game,” Tanvi admitted. Tanvi’s attempts to go wide did not work and her deceptive net play, usually on point, were ineffective against the quick-footed Hina. Unnati too suffered from too many shots going too wide, unable to control her shots against Neslihan, the Turkish 31-year-old making her first ever World Tour final. The longer the rallies went, the more in control Neslihan got, making Unnati work hard for every point. Srikanth had to work hard for his points against Mithun before finding his rhythm in the decider and admitted it was tough. “There was a slight drift but not uncontrollable.

At a press conference, BJP MP and spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi alleged that Telangana Chief Minister Revanth Reddy had made “derogatory and offensive” comments about Hindu deities, which were “unacceptable” and “deeply hurtful to religious sentiments”. He also referred to Mr. Reddy’s previous remarks purportedly supporting the Muslim community. “We have no problem with your wholehearted support for the Muslim community. But abusing the Hindu gods and goddesses is intolerable,” Mr. Trivedi said, adding that no action was taken against an AIMIM leader in Telangana for allegedly using a similar “anti-Hindu language”. The BJP leader also accused Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu of saying “What is the need to sayRadhe-Radhe?” in response to schoolchildren who greeted him with “Radhe-Radhe”. “Why one Congress Chief Minister was insulting Hindu deities, while another appeared to discourage children from using traditional greetings?” Mr. Trivedi asked. “One of your alliance partners, the DMK, held a structured conference on the Eradication of Sanatana Dharma. It was not a mere statement, but a well-planned, well-thought-out, academic conference. In Hindi, it means the total destruction of Hinduism,” he said. “So, I want to ask the Congress and Rahul Gandhi, has the Congress started pursuing the programme of Eradication of Sanatana Dharma, meaning the total destruction of Hinduism, and has it instructed its Chief Ministers to launch direct attacks on Indian culture and the deities of Hinduism?” the BJP leader said, also asking at whose instance the “agenda” was being carried forward.",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bjp-alleges-congress-shows-contempt-for-hindu-beliefs-and-traditions/article70353376.ece

By August, the government shortlisted two sites—one near Uchipulli and another near Keelakarai. Subsequently, the government had requested AAI to carry out a pre-feasibility study to study the pros and cons of both sites. By the end of October, a team from AAI visited the villages around the two sites. The first site Uchipuli, villages close by include Perungulam, Kumbaram and Valantharavai. In the second site located close to Keelakarai, the neighbouring villages include Manikaneri and Mayakulam, he added. “Both the sites seem feasible now. The first site near Uchipuli is situated near INS Parundu, an Indian Naval Air Station. If the State government chooses this site, then they will need approval from the Indian Navy,” he said.

Traders offered the new exchange rate as attempts so far to restart negotiations between America and Iran over its nuclear program appear stalled. The new record low is increasing pressure on food prices and other costs have been making daily life that much more challenging for Iranians. Prices are up on meat, rice and other staples of the Iranian dinner table. Meanwhile, people worry about anew round of fighting between Iran and Israel— as well as potentially the United States — after June’s 12-day war. “Life will not only become more difficult for ordinary people, but it will also fuel public concern over whether the government — given the limited inflow of foreign currency caused by sanctions — has the resources to maintain and repair the country’s aging infrastructure,” said Ali Moshtagh, a 53-year-old electrical engineer. Iran’s economy has been severely affected by international sanctions, particularly after U.S. President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers in 2018. At the time of the 2015 deal, which saw Iran drastically limit its enrichment and stockpiling of uranium in exchange for lifting of international sanctions, the rial traded at 32,000 to the dollar. After Mr. Trump returned to the White House for his second term in January, he restarted his so-called “maximum pressure” campaign targeting Tehran with sanctions. He again went after firms trading Iranian crude oil, including those selling at a discount in China.

Following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in Feb. 2022, many athletes were banned from entering competitions. The Russian Olympic Committee has been suspended since 2023 by the International Olympic Committee for breaking the Olympic charter by using an administrative land grab to incorporate regional sports bodies in occupied eastern Ukraine.

WithManav Kaul, that has happened twice recently.

He returns to the valley withReal Kashmir Football Club,set to be released on Sony LIV on December 9. Playing a Kashmiri Pandit businessman, who helps in building a soccer team, the show bears even closer resemblance to Manav’s own life. Especially how in the first episode of the show, his character says with heartfelt honesty that he has left Kashmir once and won’t do it again. Perhaps the resolute charm in his voice comes from his lived reality of leaving the valley during the rise of insurgency in the 1990s — an experience he has sumptuously captured in his deeply personal travelogue,Rooh.Manav lets out a big smile at the comparison. Interestingly, it was during his second meeting with the series’ director, Mahesh Mathai, and producer, Kilian Kerwin, that Manav learned both of them had readRooh. “That was a different meeting altogether. It is like they had consumed my work and then they were talking to me. I just felt heard when I met them. It was a big thing for me. I realised during that meeting how sensitively they were making the show by understanding every aspect of Kashmir,” Manav says.

The order was issued by the NGT on December 2 based on a report titled ‘A fire that fails to die down’ appeared inThe Hinduon November 7 carrying the complaints of the affected families about pollution and the arguments of the company management linked to the ₹22-crore facility, which was opened six years ago with a capacity to treat 25 tonnes of waste per day. The tribunal observed that the claims, if true, indicated possible violations of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, the Water (prevention and Control of Pollution) Act of 1974 and the Air (prevention and Control of Pollution) Act of 1981. Citing the Supreme Court’s 2021 ruling in Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai v/s Ankita Sinha, the NGT also reaffirmed its power to initiate suo motu proceedings in matters of environmental concerns.

The 2025 theme is “fostering disability inclusive societies for advancing social progress”. In this episode, we examine India’s Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Act, 2016, and the principle of reasonable accommodation. Under Section 2(y), reasonable accommodation means “any necessary and appropriate modification and/or adjustment” that enables PwDs to enjoy their rights equally with others, without imposing a “disproportionate or undue burden.”Yet despite clear policy mandates, it remains treated as a “nice to have” by many organisations and public institutions. Why do implementation gaps persist? What costs—physical, emotional, and social—do employees with disabilities bear? And what will it take to move beyond tick-box compliance toward genuine inclusion?

246,2025,The Hindu,246,"Wei and Sindarov agree for a quick draw in second classical game Tie-break? Bring it on. That has been a theme song at the Chess World Cup. Wei Yi and Javokhir Sindarov sang it rather well at Resort Rio on Tuesday. They agreed to a quick draw in the second classical game of the semifinal. Their first game had also been drawn, but not as fast, and Wednesday’s tie-break games – in rapid and then blitz if necessary – will now determine the champion. The second classical game proved shorter than a rapid one, in fact. Wei and Sindarov needed just 24 minutes – and the minimum 30 moves -- to finish their Four Knights Game. The players’ approach to such a crucial game was not surprising, though. The day’s other game was just as important, if not more. Andrey Esipenko and Nodirbek Yakubboev were fighting for a place in the Candidates tournament, the qualifier that would decide the World championship challenger (the top three from the World Cup get the ticket to Cyprus directly). And Esipenko won that game, and thus the match 2-0. After winning his first game, the Russian had only needed a draw. But his Uzbek rival was in a must-win situation as only the full point could have forced a tie-break; it instead proved a nightmare. In the English Opening game, Yakubboev got into an inferior position early: there was a dubious 11th move with his bishop, and a couple of moves later, Esipenko came up with an excellent pawn-push on the queen-side. A steep slide it was from then on for Yakubboev, who eventually resigned after 26 moves, with checkmate not far away. Not many may grudge Esipenko’s victory. It was his blunder in the semifinal against Wei that prevented him from booking his place in the Candidates earlier. “It is the best performance of my career,” he said shortly after staging the spirited comeback.

247,2025,The Hindu,247,"Odds appear stacked against Mamkootathil as more leaders join the chorus for his expulsion from the Congress The odds appeared stacked against Palakkad MLA Rahul Mamkootathil on Wednesday, with a growing chorus of Congress leaders demanding the expulsion of the legislator, who is battling charges of serial sexual predation and misconduct, from the party and his resignation from elected office. Former KPCC president V. M. Sudheeran toldThe Hinduthat Mr Mamkootathil’s continuation as MLA had become morally untenable after another set of accusations, including rape, surfaced against him in the public domain. UDF convener Adoor Prakash said the party had received a new set of accusations of rape against Mr. Mamkootathil, rendering the issue more complicated. “We have made a decision, which the party will communicate at the appropriate time”, he said KPCC president Sunny Joseph said the party would act at the right time. “However, whether a Congress worker facing disciplinary action should renounce an elected position was the individual’s choice”, he added. The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) also appeared keen not to allow the sexual misconduct swirling around Mr Mamkootathil to weigh down the Opposition local body poll campaign. However, the party also signalled that any action against Mr Mamkootathil, including expulsion and issuance of a writ for his resignation as party MLA, would hinge on whether the court granted him anticipatory bail on Thursday. A party insider said an adverse decision would help the KPCC leadership to justify its “impending action” before Mr Mamkootathil’s backers in the party. Mr Mamkootathil’s supporters had expressed their ire at the media for projecting questions about Mr Mamkootathil’s continuation in the party to senior leader Ramesh Chennithala in the MLA’s constituency in Palakkad.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that Mr. Trump has brokered several peace deals, including the very dangerous ones like India and Pakistan, and deserves tremendous credit for reshaping America's foreign policy. Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh said that on May 10, 2025, at 5.37 p.m., Mr. Rubio was the first person to announce the abrupt stoppage of Operation Sindoor.

""Now Mr. Rubio has once again reminded the world of what Mr. Trump has been saying repeatedly. No wonder the Modi-Trump huglomacy is in deep freeze,"" Mr. Ramesh said.

Speaking at a press interaction organised by Russian news outletSputnik, Mr. Peskov said President Putin will be accompanied with officials who will bring new proposals in the civil nuclear and military domains and said that the western sanctions that have created a hurdle before India-Russia trade relations are “illegal”. “There are some countries that would try and put obstacles on the way of development of our trade. So let’s stick to our own interests and we have to make sure that India is sharing this approach,” said Mr. Peskov highlighting the need for using national currencies in bilateral trade. The Kremlin spokesperson said that the share of U.S. dollars in global trade is “decreasing” and that the share of national currencies in global trade is “increasing”. Mr. Peskov described the U.S. tariffs imposed on India for the purchase of Russian energy as a “bilateral” issue between India and the U.S. but added, “What concerns us is the way we are going to continue and enlarge the volume of our bilateral business with India not letting anyone interfere in that.” “Russia continues to be a very important supplier of energy sources to India on competitive prices and we know that this trade is of great benefit to India and at the same time of mutual benefit,” said Mr. Peskov explaining that “various methods of payments between the two countries will be on the agenda” of the talks during the visit. “We have to organise our trade volume and our trade interaction in the way that cannot be affected by third countries.

The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) had on Monday (December 1) issued a directive requiring phone manufacturers to pre-install the cybersecurity app on all devices from March 2026 onwards, citing concerns over handsets with duplicate or spoofed IMEI numbers posing threats to telecom security. However, facing intense pushback over privacy and surveillance concerns, the Government announced it would no longer enforce the mandatory pre-installation requirement. In a press release, the government attributed the policy reversal to the app’s “increasing acceptance” among users. Officials said the Sanchar Saathi app witnessed a dramatic surge in adoption following the initial announcement, with 6 lakh new registrations recorded in a single day — a tenfold increase in uptake. “Given Sanchar Saathi’s increasing acceptance, Government has decided not to make the pre-installation mandatory for mobile manufacturers,” the release stated. The app, launched in 2023 as a portal for citizens to report suspicious phone calls and cyber fraud, currently has 1.4 crore users who collectively report approximately 2,000 fraud incidents daily. The mandatory pre-installation order had drawn sharp criticism from digital rights advocates and opposition parties, who raised concerns about potential government surveillance and infringement on user choice.

A doubt, a suspicion leading to statelessness. What is the basis of this power,” advocate Vrinda Grover, appearing for the petitioners, asked during her submissions before a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India Surya Kant. She argued that the SIR frustrated the vision of the Constitution by allowing en masse scrutiny of citizenship by the Election Commission based on executive order rather than parliamentary legislation. The Election Commission (EC), on the other hand, has asserted its authority to “assess citizenship” for the purpose of registration in electoral rolls. The poll body has maintained that its plenary power to scrutinise citizenship flows directly from Article 324, which empowers it to supervise and control the conduct of elections. It has also contended that the authority of Parliament to make laws on elections under Article 327 must align with the EC’s plenary powers. Advocates Prashant Bhushan and Neha Rathi argued that this was the first time since the first election in 1950 that the EC was preparing the election rolls from a “clean slate”. Earlier elections were held by adding or deleting names from existing rolls. There was never an occasion when the voter list was wiped clean. “The SIR is a de novo preparation of the voter list.

RI for housing loan fraud The VIth Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court at Nampally on December 2, sentenced two individuals to seven years of rigorous imprisonment and imposed a fine of ₹30,000 each in a housing loan fraud case investigated by the Telangana CID. The convicted persons - Vuppula Dasarath Netha, 57, and Vuppala Laxmi Bai, also known as Laxmi Devi, 50 - are residents of Nethaji Nagar, Erragadda. According to an officer from the Telangana CID, the couple fraudulently obtained a housing loan of ₹24,00,199 from the State Bank of Hyderabad’s Air Cargo branch in 2007 by using forged and fabricated documents. “They impersonated the actual owner of the property, forged signatures and created a false agreement of sale cum GPA, which they managed to register. The loan pertained to an independent house at Jeedimetla,” said the officer. Investigators said the accused carried out multiple sale registrations for the same property using fake documents and went on to secure additional loans from the State Bank of Mysore, Kukatpally branch, and Canara Bank, Kundanbagh branch. They later defaulted on all repayments, causing financial losses to the banks. The CID arrested the accused and filed a chargesheet after collecting evidence that included forged deeds, registration records, handwriting samples and bank documents. During the trial, 17 witnesses were examined and 60 documents were produced before the court. The court convicted both under Sections 420, 468, 471 read with 120B of the Indian Penal Code.

Commencing his rejoinder arguments on behalf of Ms. Fatima, senior advocate A.M. Singhvi submitted that his client had already spent nearly six years in custody, and described such prolonged pre-trial detention as “astonishing and unprecedented”. “Where have you alleged regime change as the heart of your chargesheet?” he asked, adding that the prosecution’s assertion of a pan-India conspiracy “to separate Assam from India” was equally unfounded. Additional Solicitor-General S.V.

It is not a fit case for releasing Prajwal on bail by suspending the sentence during the pendency of his appeal against conviction, the court said, after assessing the material on record against him, the gravity of the offence, and the possible impact on the remaining rape cases as in those cases are pending against him. A Division Bench comprising Justice K.S. Mudagal and Justice Venkatesh Naik T. passed the order while dismissing an interlocutory application filed by Prajwal seeking suspension of sentence during the pendency of his appeal against trial court’s August 1 verdict of convicting him on the charge of raping a 48-year-old woman, who was working as a domestic help in the family’s Gannikada farmhouse in Holenarasipura in Hassan district of Karnataka. He had raped her twice — at Hassan farmhouse, and at the Bengaluru residence of the family — in 2021, and the act was recorded by him on his mobile phone. The Bench found force in the argument of the Special Public Prosecutor that the witnesses in other rape cases are likely to be tampered with if Prajwal is released on bail by suspending his sentence. Prajwal was convicted for the offences under Sections 376(2)(k) (being in a position of control or dominance over a woman, commits rape on such woman), 376 (2)(n) (repeated rape on the same woman), 354A (sexual harassment), 354B (assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe), 354C (voyeurism), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 201 (disappearance of evidence) of the IPC, and Section 66E (violation of privacy) of the Information Technology Act, 2000.

The Central Excise (Amendment) Bill, 2025, was passed by a voice vote in the lower house. Also read:Parliament Winter session Day 3 updates The Bill, once enacted, will give the government the fiscal space to increase the rate of central excise duty on tobacco and related products after GST compensation cess, which is currently levied on all tobacco products like cigarettes, chewing tobacco, cigars, hookah, zarda, and scented tobacco, ceases to exist. Currently, a 28% Goods and Services Tax (GST) plus cess at a varied rate is levied on tobacco and related products. The bill proposes to levy an excise duty of 60-70% on unmanufactured tobacco. Excise on cigars and cheroots is proposed at 25% or ₹5,000 per 1,000 sticks, whichever is higher. Cigarettes, depending on length and filter, are proposed to be taxed in the range of ₹2,700-₹11,000 per 1,000 sticks, while chewing tobacco is taxed at ₹100 per kg. The Bill seeks to substitute the table containing the tariff rates of tobacco and tobacco products in Section IV of the Fourth Schedule to the Central Excise Act, 1944. When GST was introduced on July 1, 2017, the rates of Central Excise duties on tobacco and such products were reduced significantly to allow for the levy of compensation cess without a large impact on their tax incidence. Compensation cess levied on tobacco and tobacco products will be discontinued once interest payment obligations and loan liabilities under the compensation cess account are completely discharged.“ Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in the Lok Sabha: “In another, probably, couple of weeks the loans will be completely repaid.

Currently, a trial for this is ongoing in Haryana alone. The feature, known as Caller Name Presentation (CNAP), will use the same technology that telecom operators such as Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel use to flag certain calls as “Suspected” or “Suspicious,” but instead of those words, the caller ID will display the name a number was registered with. The move has been proposed since 2022 as a key step in fighting fraud and spam calls, by allowing users to screen calls before they answer them. The move is aggressive — countries that have mandated CNAP, like Qatar, have only done so for corporates placing calls. The feature will be enabled by default, and users might have the choice to disable seeing the KYC name of people from whom they receive calls, with the corollary — concealing one’s name from call recipients — being available only to restricted line facility users, like Ministers and top government officials. Anti-spam move With the move, the DoT and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), which released recommendations earlier this year on the facility at the former’s request, said that scammers and spam callers would find it harder to have their calls answered, especially now that all call recipients would be able to screen to whom a certain incoming call’s number corresponds. The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), which supported the move, expressed reservations during a 2022 consultation by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. “Under CNAP, there may be genuine cases wherein some users are not keen to share their name,” the industry body said in a filing.

A draft rule had also been published for identifying and taking necessary action on AI-generated deepfakes, and consultations on this were currently underway, he said. The Minister appreciated the work of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Communications and Information Technology, and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Nishikant Dubey, and all the members, for presenting a detailed report containing key recommendations for strengthening the legal framework.

The resolution was moved in the Rajya Sabha by Environment and Forest Minister Bhupender Yadav, who said the two Houses need to adopt the resolution on the central Act, since there is President’s rule in Manipur.

Which one of these things is there in the State of Manipur today, and who is responsible for it?” Ms. Dev questioned. “In a State where people are still living in relief camps, and internally displaced people are protesting outside the Raj Bhawan, we are making a mockery of it by bringing a Water Pollution Act 2025 amendment and saying we are helping Manipur. “If you want to help Manipur, you must immediately hold elections democratically. This is a murder of cooperative federalism,” she said. Congress MP Neeraj Dangi said the resolution had to be presented in Parliament because the situation in Manipur has not improved. “Law and order have totally collapsed in Manipur; it has gone beyond the control of the chief minister, and the centre did not pay attention to it.

Perry’s family and possibly others affected by his death will have a chance to make a statement in federal court in Los Angeles before the sentencing of Dr. Salvador Plasencia. Prosecutors are asking U.S. District Judge Sherilyn Peace Garnett to sentence Dr. Plasencia, 44, to three years in prison after a plea agreement where the doctor admitted to illegally selling Perry large amounts of ketamine. He was not accused of selling the actor the dose that investigators say killed him on October 28, 2023. Perry had been taking the surgical anaesthetic ketamine legally as a treatment for depression. But when his regular doctor wouldn’t provide it in the amounts he wanted, he turned to Dr. Plasencia, who admitted to illegally selling to Perry despite knowing he was a struggling addict. He texted another doctor that Perry was a “moron” who could be exploited for money, according to court filings. “Rather than do what was best for Mr. Perry — someone who had struggled with addiction for most of his life — defendant sought to exploit Perry’s medical vulnerability for profit,” the prosecution’s sentencing memo said. Dr. Plasencia’s lawyers tried to give a sympathetic portrait of him in their memo, as a man who rose out of poverty to become a doctor beloved by his patients, some of whom provided testimonials about him for the court.

The pause applies to people from 19 countries that were alreadysubjected to a partial travel ban in June, placing further restrictions on immigration — a core feature of U.S. President Donald Trump’s political platform. The list of countries includes Afghanistan and Somalia. The official memorandum outlining the new policy cites the attack on U.S. National Guard members in Washington last week in which an Afghan man has been arrested as a suspect. One member of the National Guard was killed and another was critically wounded in the shooting. Mr. Trump has also stepped up rhetoric against Somalis in recent days, calling them “garbage” and saying “we don’t want them in our country.” Since returning to office in January, Mr. Trump has aggressively prioritized immigration enforcement, sending federal agents to major U.S. cities and turning away asylum seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border.

The flurry of promised restrictions since the attack on National Guard members suggests an increased focus on legal immigration framed around protecting national security and casting blame on former President Joe Biden for his policies.

The process to elect the next UN chief formally kicked off last week as member states were asked to nominate candidates to take over the role from Antonio Guterres of Portugal from January 1, 2027. Despite the U.N.’s 80-year history as an international agency for peace and cooperation, the secretary-general role has never been held by a woman, a reality Ms. Grynspan says defies explanation given how many women have the merit and credentials to lead. Publicly declared candidates for the role include Ms. Grynspan, who currently serves as secretary-general of the UN Conference on Trade and Development, Chile’s former President Michelle Bachelet, and Argentine diplomat Rafael Grossi. “We don’t need special treatment. What we are really asking for is no discrimination,” Mr. Grynspan, 69, toldReutersin an interview in London. “If equality will prevail, we will be able to get there. That’s the only thing that we are asking: equal treatment.” Calls have been growing for a woman to assume the role, and the next secretary-general will likely come from Latin America as the position traditionally rotates among regions.

The yatra drew more than 5,000 activists from Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajanagar, Hassan, and surrounding districts.

Epilepsy affects 3 to 6 per 1,000 children worldwide and 5.59 per 1,000 population in India, with 40% of global new cases occurring in children under 18 years. According to Jipmer, while 70-80% of children achieve seizure freedom with one or two medications, 25-30% may develop drug-resistant epilepsy, which poses the risk of long-term neurological damage to the developing brain.

328,2025,The Hindu,328,"Rain damages major roads near central bus stand The recent spell of heavy rainfall over the past few weeks has left several key roads around the Central Bus Stand in Tiruchi severely damaged, causing hardship to commuters and motorists. Uneven road surfaces and potholes have become common sights on major stretches, with the top layer eroded in many places. The damaged patches have led to frequent skidding incidents, particularly affecting two-wheeler riders. Important stretches around the Central Bus Stand, such as Rockins Road, McDonalds Road, VOC Road, and Williams Road, have suffered significant deterioration. Some of these roads that were laid recently have also been damaged following the downpour. With heavy vehicle movement continuing through these roads, the loose surface material has begun to dislodge, worsening driving conditions. Motorists say the situation has grown increasingly unsafe, especially during nighttime travel. “It is very difficult to navigate at night. Vehicles struggle to navigate as gravel is scattered across the road, and the potholes are deep. In some places, the road has completely worn off,” P. Vasanth, said a motorist. According to residents, poor drainage systems remain a key cause of repeated road damage during the monsoon. The stormwater drains along McDonalds Road, in particular, are narrow and frequently clogged, allowing rainwater to stagnate. Residents urged the authorities to carry out immediate repair works and ensure proper stormwater drainage facilities to prevent recurring damage. They have also called for proper milling work before relaying damaged stretches, along with strict enforcement of road quality standards. A sum of ₹20 lakh per zone had been allocated for road repair. Corporation officials said that a temporary patchwork would be undertaken soon, followed by permanent restoration once the rain subsides.

Shanmugam said the party was pressing for ₹35,000 per acre for inundated paddy fields, instead of the ₹8,000 per acre announced by the State. He said farmers across the Cauvery delta had suffered heavy losses, with nearly three lakh acres of samba and thaladi paddy submerged. Agricultural labourers deprived of work due to the rains must also be compensated, he added, urging the Union government to release adequate funds from the Disaster Relief Fund. Mr. Shanmugam said the CPI(M) extended full support to the series of labour agitations scheduled for December 8, jointly organised by Left parties and the VCK against the Union government’s labour codes. These codes, he said, dilute long-won worker protections, expand contract labour, and weaken job security for youth entering the workforce. The party also asked the State to resolve the ongoing protest by Chennai Corporation conservancy workers, reiterating that sanitation responsibilities should not be outsourced to private contractors and must remain within the Corporation’s workforce. Expressing displeasure with the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, the CPI(M) said the hurried exercise had created “widespread procedural confusion” and placed unreasonable pressure on booth-level officers.

B. Udayakumar said that the flooding and water inundation in Chennai and other northern districts could have been handled efficiently. Speaking to media persons here on Wednesday, he said that normally, the government should be prepared from October to face the challenges that may erupt during the northeast monsoon, which extends up to December. Pointing out the flaws in handling the Ditwah cyclone, he said the government slowed down its activities as it was centred in Sri Lanka. When the torrential rains hit the State capital, the execution by the officials at the ground showed that they were not prepared to face the consequences, he charged and added that in many low-lying areas,  communication to the first responders were missing. When asked about the government’s claim that the storm water drains were ready and that there would not be any waterlogging, he didn’t wish to be drawn into politics at this juncture.

With less than nine days for the polls, cautious optimism appears to be abundant in the corridors of the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) Opposition. Having been shut out of power for nearly a decade, the UDF is acutely aware that the local government polls will provide, arguably, the first real-world measure of how public opinion towards rival political fronts has shifted since the Lok Sabha polls in 2024 and the subsequent Assembly byelections in Palakkad, Chelakkara, and, more recently, Nilambur (2025). The UDF leadership generally feels that its political identity as a cohesive coalitionis at stake in the local body polls, a precursor to the 2026 Assembly elections.  It seeks to negate the Left Democratic Front (LDF) campaign that the Opposition is a shaky coalition built on protest against development rather than one capable of exercising power effectively. The UDF has sought to recalibrate its election strategy to dodge the image trap set by the ruling front. It has presented a damning charge sheet against the government, along with a local body election manifesto that projects a credible and bankable alternative to nine years of the LDF rule.

At a recent meeting of the District Tourism Council (DTC), chaired by District Collector M. N. Harendhira Prasad, tourism authorities were instructed to analyse the feasibility of creating a cluster that covers Padmanabham and Anandapuram—both known for their rich heritage.

The proposed circuit is expected to include Pandrangi village in Padmanabham mandal, the birthplace of freedom fighter Alluri Sitarama Raju; the centuries-old Siva temple at Gudilova, popularly known as Gudilova Sivalayam; and the historic Victory Pillar, or Vijaya Stupam, erected nearly 500 years ago by Emperor Sri Krishnadevaraya at Potnuru village. The plan also proposes including the ancient Anantha Padmanabha Swamy Temple in Padmanabham mandal to further enhance the circuit’s cultural appeal.

“We have shared the Padmanabham tourist cluster proposal with INTACH officials. After receiving their feedback, it will be forwarded to higher authorities for development,” said District Tourism Officer Madhavi.

During the meeting, several members of the tourism fraternity requested the Collector to allow visitors access to key attractions such as the Beach Road stretch even after midnight. They pointed out that existing police restrictions force tourists to return to their hotels before midnight, though many prefer to enjoy the Beach Road at night for leisure and celebrations. The discussion also emphasised boosting water sports along city beaches, resolving land issues affecting tourism projects, and developing eco-friendly facilities at attractions such as Thotlakonda and Bavikonda.

The official said that the SV National Park belt had witnessed multiple fatal attacks in recent years, including four human casualties. It was observed that these forest routes would be used by the pedestrian pilgrims towards Tirumala and other temples in the forested areas. The DFO said that Section 27 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, had been invoked at present to prohibit entry into the wildlife sanctuary without a valid permit. “The offence will be punishable with up to three years’ imprisonment or a ₹25,000 fine, or both,” Mr. Jagannath Singh said, urging pilgrims and public to strictly avoid the main belt to prevent human-elephant conflict.",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/forest-routes-in-sv-national-park-closed-to-pilgrims-public-due-to-movement-of-wild-elephants/article70353546.ece

The Department of Agriculture has announced that Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu will participate in the workshop at the RSK at Nallajerla village in East Godavari district. Director of Agriculture Manazir Jeelani Samoon, on Tuesday, said the discussions would centre around identifying the major crops cultivated in each RSK area, evolving scientific methods to increase yield, assessing region-specific agro-climatic and water resource conditions, and strengthening access to market support systems. Key Performance Indicators for boosting productivity and increasing farmers’ gross income would be collectively identified by farmers and officials. Dr. Samoon said the workshops would emphasise the need for changes in cropping patterns, adoption of modern agricultural practices, and improvements in water management. Season-wise action plans would be framed based on actual cultivation area, yield data, and production estimates. A portion of land would be earmarked for natural farming to minimise chemical fertilizer usage, while farmers would be encouraged to use soil-test-based fertilizer application and organic manures such as FYM and compost. Action plans for allied sectors such as horticulture, animal husbandry, and fisheries would also be prepared. Dr. Samoon urged farmers to participate actively in the workshops and share their practical experiences and needs, reiterating that the government was moving forward with a five-point strategy to strengthen the agricultural sector and ensure comprehensive support to every farmer in the State.",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/rythanna-meekosam-workshops-in-andhra-pradesh-on-december-3/article70349754.ece

Sangham district Secretary K. Srinivas called for the supply of quality gunny bags and compensation under crop insurance to those affected by the drastic fall in paddy yield. Speaking to the media after inspecting paddy stored at drying yards in Munduru and Vegivada villages of Pedavegi mandal, Mr. Srinivas said many farmers and tenant cultivators were facing severe hardship because of reduced productivity. “The cyclone has reduced yields by 10-15 bags per acre, pushing farmers into heavy losses,” he said. He emphasized that even though the government is purchasing paddy and making timely payments as per norms, the reduced yield is forcing farmers into debt. Mr. Srinivas demanded relaxation of moisture percentage norms and immediate shifting of existing paddy stocks to mills.

AddressingKarmanye, a meeting of senior BJP workers here, he said the Centre is determined to eliminate Naxalism by March 2026. “Guns may remain in the hands of the police, but they should not be in the hands of every individual,” he said, appealing to militants to lay down arms and participate in elections. Mr. Venkaiah Naidu called for a return to value-based and ideological politics, warning that democracy will ultimately collapse if political conduct is not rooted in nationalism and ethical standards. “Leaders must maintain constant contact with the people,” he said, “and the true strength of politics lies in serving society. Politics is not a ladder for positions but a platform for service.” He urged senior party workers to guide younger generations and take ideology to the public with dedication, emphasising that true political leadership is measured by what one gives to the country rather than what one receives. Former Governor Bandaru Dattatreya recalled the initial scepticism about the BJP’s prospects, noting that when he joined the party, many questioned whether it would ever come to power. Today, he said, the NDA government is in power at the Centre, and the BJP holds chief ministerial positions in several States. He expressed confidence that India will achieve significant progress by 2047 under capable leadership. Former BJP organising general secretary Venu Gopal Reddy highlighted that party members must channel their ambitions with self-respect and commitment, functioning not merely as party leaders but as true public servants.

The interlinking of these rivers will guarantee water security for all purposes, such as drinking, agriculture and industries”. In response to farmers’ concerns about groundwater resources and the cost of digging borewells, the Chief Minister said an estimated ₹5,000 crore could be saved on electricity consumption for agricultural purposes if the groundwater table is managed through effective initiatives. In Andhra Pradesh, nearly 20 lakh pumpsets are catering to the irrigation needs of farmers. Referring to the key decisions over power tariff, Mr. Naidu said, “There will be no hike in electricity charges for agriculture purposes.

The relevant G.O. (Ms.No.253) was issued by S. Suresh Kumar, Principal Secretary, Municipal Administration and Uraban Development, on Tuesday. The policy marks a major step towards achieving Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu’s vision of cleaner, investment-ready cities.

The new rules mandate that advertisements comply with strict safety, content and placement norms to ensure clutter-free and citizen-friendly streets. Display devices larger than 50 sq. ft. now require structural safety certification, annual audits and liability insurance. Hoardings near religious places, hospitals, schools, traffic junctions and heritage sites are prohibited, while offensive and socially harmful content stands banned. Individuals and agencies must obtain licence, with every device requiring official permission and visible traceability details.

He added that the meeting had ended speculation on whether the ties between the Congress and the DMK would continue. The INDIA bloc remained strong, he said. To a question over whether the Congress will seek to contest in considerably higher number of seats like it did in the 2016 Assembly elections, Mr. Selvaperunthagai said, “Please wait and then see.” Some second lined leaders in the TNCC believe  the party might find it difficult to convince the DMK to part with more seats with their political presence continuing to decline in Tamil Nadu. “When former TNCC president K.S. Alagiri accepted 25 seats in 2021 as part of the alliance, Rahul Gandhi was not happy at all. So, definitely, we might not accept 25 seats, but demanding the number we got in 2016 might not be possible. We may have to settle for a little more than 25 seats,” said a senior leader. He claimed, “The DMK often plays one ally against the other. They would say that giving us more seats would result in the VCK seeking more seats because....to be fair...VCK is substantially stronger presence than the Congress at this point of time.” A senior leader from the VCK, also echoed similar sentiments, “Whenever VCK demands more seats, we are often told that giving us more seats would result in CPI and CPI(M) seeking more seats.

Referring to the plight of banana farmers, he said they were forced to sell at 50 paise per kg while consumers pay ₹50, benefiting only the middlemen. “The government’s ‘Sampada Srushti’ initiative has raised the State’s debt to ₹2.66 lakh crore,” he alleged, and demanded MSP assurance for all crops and advance supply of seeds and fertilizers.

The recent High Court judgement restricting the government from issuing any fresh notification, for now, under the State legislation that allowed reservation crossing the 50% limit has left the job aspirants anxious. The government, according to informed sources, is “weighing its options” since alternatives are few due to political pressure and compulsions. “We do not know what view Karnataka High Court would ultimately take in cases pending before it,” a source said. The meeting chaired by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah recently to take stock of the situation ended without any substantial outcome. “The government is in a dilemma since the situation is in flux. The government feels that the current issues have larger constitutional ramifications, and could involve intervention of Supreme Court too,” said the source.

After the one-man commission headed by retired judge H.N. Nagmohan Das submitted its report, the government modified the categories and accepted the report in August this year.

Sri Shanmukha Veda Vidyaalayam principal and vedic scholar Kappagantu Janaki Rama Sarma explained that the Mahavishnu Yagam is dedicated to Lord Rama, the divine form of Vishnu, and is conducted as a complete Valmiki Ramayana Havan. Devotees participate in special worship, homas (fire rituals) and ceremonial activities, all centred around Lord Rama’s divine intentions. While the Yagam primarily focuses on Lord Rama, rituals for other deities are also included, such as Narayana Ashtakshari Homa. The name ‘Mahavishnu Yagam’ reflects the holistic nature of the ceremony, encompassing a full spectrum of Vedic rites rather than being limited to a ‘Rama Yagam.’ This ensures a complete and spiritually comprehensive observance. The Yagam will begin on Pushya Bahula Saptami (December 27) and conclude on Pushya Bahula Ashtami (January 11) under the divine guidance of Sri Veeranjaneyaswami. Devotees are encouraged to participate, receive Tirtha Prasadam, and seek the blessings of the deity. Daily rituals begin at 6 am with Rudrabhishekam, Navagraha Abhishekam and regular worship. From 8.30 am, homas including Rudra Homa, Chandi Saptashati Homa, Mahalakshmi Homa, and Ramayana Shloka Havan are performed, followed by Kumkuma Archana, Sindoorarchana and Nagavalli Dalaarchana. Afternoon ceremonies feature Mahanivedana, Neerajan, Mantra Pushpalu and Tirtha Prasadam distribution. Evening Kalyanotsavams, special Vedic recitations and rituals such as Aruna Parayana, Surya Namaskara and various Vratams will be conducted on designated days. The Yagam concludes with Maha Poornahuti and Sri Rama Mahasamrajya Pattabhishekam at 8 a.m. on January 11.

Inviting applications from farmers to obtain the solar irrigation pump sets, Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation (CESC) said the Government of Karnataka is implementing the KUSUM-B scheme to enable farmers to install pump sets at subsidised rates. The use of solar energy for irrigation pump sets will significantly reduce dependence on conventional electricity. “The KUSUM-B scheme has been designed to reduce reliance on traditional power sources for irrigation and enable farmers to become self-reliant by using solar energy. To make agriculture more profitable and to promote the use of solar power, an 80% subsidy is being provided. Under this scheme, priority is given to installing off-grid solar agricultural pump sets. Farmers will have to bear only 20% of the cost, while 50% is provided by the State government and 30% by the Union government,” the CESC said in a statement here on December 3. K.M. Munigopal Raju, CESC managing director, said the KUSUM-B scheme, which plays an important role in providing daytime irrigation facilities to farmers through solar pump sets, is set to conclude in December. He urged farmers to make use of the facility immediately. With the support of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) and Karnataka Renewable Energy Development Limited (KREDL), farmers in Karnataka can apply online to install solar pump sets on their borewells/open wells through the website www.souramitra.com. “Through this portal, farmers must register, select a vendor/agency, and pay their 20% share for the installation of the solar pump set,” CESC said.

The sankirtana yatra is a sensitive issue as the Hindu Jagarana Vedike, which backs the event, has been claiming that the Hanuman temple in the town was destroyed during the period of Tipu Sultan and the existing Jamia Masjid was built after demolishing the temple in 1786. Hence, the organisation wants the site back to reconstruct the temple. The Moodalabagilu Sankirtana Yatra is slated to commence from Nimishambha temple on the banks of the river Cauvery at 10 a.m. following which the sankirtana yatra will begin from the same venue at 11 a.m. The yatris will march to Srirangapatna Fort and have darshan of Moodalabagilu Anjaneyaswami at the shrine. Lohit V. Urs of Moodalabagilu Hanuma Mala Samithi told reporters here on Tuesday that there will be ‘mala visarjan’ and distribution of prasad at the grounds near Sriranganathaswamy temple. He said that Hanuma Maladharis from all taluks of Mandya, Mysuru, Hassan, Chamarajanagar and Bengaluru will take part in the sankirtana yatra.

Dr. Kumar said permission has been granted to religious observance, and it should be done peacefully and nobody should act in a manner so as to disturb peace and order in society.

The event, which began on Tuesday, saw a massive turnout of Hanuma Mala bearers from across the country. From early Wednesday morning, devotees were seen taking a holy dip and proceeding towards the hilltop shrine chanting “Sri Ram Jaya Ram” and “Pavanasuta Anjaneya Jai”. Long queues formed at the foothills and along the steps, as devotees waited patiently for the darshan of Lord Anjaneya. Many devotees travelled in groups on foot, while others arrived in two-wheelers, four-wheelers, buses and other vehicles. The district administration had made elaborate arrangements to ensure smooth conduct of the event. Health teams were stationed at intervals along the steps as a precaution. Prasada was served on the premises of the Veda Pathashala, where devotees were provided wheat huggi, rice, sambar and tomato chutney. Multiple counters were opened to prevent crowding and ensure quick service. Traffic regulations were strictly enforced, and pre-designated parking areas helped avoid congestion. Officials from various departments, including police, revenue and health, were deployed to oversee operations.

The system, developed by the State Forest Department, will not only provide patrol routes, timings, and coverage by the field staff in real time but also present a clearer picture to the senior staff of ground readiness and help identify gaps in the forest protection exercise. Eshwar B. Khandre, Minister for Forest, Ecology and Environment, directed officials in all forest circles to adopt the newly developed software and closely monitor daily patrol rounds and strengthen frontline surveillance. This is essential to reduce human–wildlife conflict, which is on the increase, he added as he chaired a review meeting with officials of Mysuru and Chamarajanagar forest circles at Kollegal on December 3. He said effective patrolling was the first line of defence in conflict mitigation and instructed officials to provide feedback so that the software could be further tweaked and improved. ‘’This can be refined and integrated with systems like M-STRiPES, which is already being used in tiger reserves,’’ said Mr. Khandre. Underlining the imperative of co-existence, the Minister said wildlife population has been increasing but the forest area remained the same and hence, the conflict has been rising in recent days. Citing the example of Bandipur, Mr. Khandre said that the tiger population exceeded the carrying capacity of the forest and hence, real-time monitoring and quick field response were imperative to reduce conflicts. Quoting experts, the Minister said a male tiger requires at least 14 sq. km of territory, while a female needs 8–10 sq. km. ‘’By one estimate, Bandipur has 190 tigers within 950 sq. km of forest, which means the tiger density has exceeded ideal levels and the carrying capacity of the forest,’’ he added.

Kumar Naik has accused the Union government of failing to protect traditional kirana stores from the aggressive expansion of e-commerce quick-delivery platforms, claiming that nearly two lakh small retail shops have shut down across the country in the last one year. Raising the matter in the Lok Sabha during Question Hour on Tuesday, Mr. Naik said that small retailers are under severe strain due to predatory pricing and overwhelming competition from digital platforms. He asked Union Minister of Commerce and Industry whether the government recognises the pressure on kirana owners, particularly regarding pricing, competition and long-term survival in a rapidly digitising economy. “The government, in its reply, said that the sector is guided by market forces and existing laws and that aggrieved retailers can approach the Competition Commission of India (CCI). This response is deeply unrealistic as individual shopkeepers lack resources, legal access and time to fight prolonged battles against large corporations,” he said in a note released on Tuesday. Citing a report by the All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation (AICPDF), he said that almost two lakh kirana shops have closed in the last one year. “This is not a minor market shift, but a crisis affecting livelihoods, local economies and neighbourhood ecosystems,” he said. Mr. Naik said that the government continues to highlight the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) as its flagship intervention. But he pointed out that the platform has supported only 3,500 kirana stores, a negligible number when compared to the scale of closures. Welcoming the 30% procurement rule for Single Brand Retail under FDI norms as it will strengthen sourcing from MSMEs and local producers, Mr. Naik stressed the need for ensuring more than indirect protection for kirana shops. “Kirana shops need direct safeguards, fairer competition rules and active measures to prevent predatory pricing.

The organisation submitted a memorandum to senior officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the Public Works Department, demanding immediate exemption for all cane--carrying tractors and lorries on both State and national highways. In their representation, KPRS leaders said sugarcane growers have been pushed into distress after successive crop losses owing to unseasonal rains. Farmers dependent on cane cultivation are already struggling with issues such as low recovery rates, unfair weight deductions, and inadequate support prices. At a time when growers are reeling under financial strain, toll plazas demanding payment from vehicles transporting their produce amounts to injustice, they said in the memorandum. “Toll booths, including the Sannur plaza, have become anti-farmer by collecting money from cane-laden vehicles headed to sugar factories. The toll operators must immediately stop collecting fees from such vehicles and that the government should formally notify toll exemption.

374,2025,The Hindu,374,"Kerala local body polls: Will gold scandal, KC(M) shift, coalition strains redraw Pathanamthitta’s electoral map? As electioneering for the local body elections in Pathanamthitta enter its final phase, the spotlight is firmly on the alleged Sabarimala gold misappropriation case and how it could tilt the electoral balance. With the arrest of CPI(M) heavyweight and former legislator A. Padmakumar, the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) and the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) have made it the defining issue in the district. The CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF), however, is trying to flip the narrative, pointing to the multiple arrests, including that of Mr. Padmakumar, as proof of its commitment to a ‘fair’ investigation. At the same time, the ruling front is not shying away from flaunting nearly a decade of its welfare schemes and development projects as ammunition against its critics. Once a Congress bastion, the district began swinging decisively to the LDF in 2015 and in 2020 it clinched 12 out of 16 divisions in the Pathanamthitta District Panchayat. The last-minute induction of the Kerala Congress (M) into the Left fold gave the coalition a further edge just weeks ahead of the polls last time. Today, the Left front holds sway over six of the eight blocks, two of the four municipalities, and 32 of the 53 grama panchayats. Yet cracks remain, as the Kerala Congress (B) is openly opposing LDF candidates in a couple of local bodies, citing neglect and side-lining. The UDF, bruised but not beaten, is betting on its proven electoral machinery and a strong performance in the recent Lok Sabha polls to bounce back. Last-minute tweaks to candidate lists, however, have stirred pockets of resentment within the party. In the Angadi division, for instance,  the Congress State leadership stepped in directly to settle an intense local dispute. Riding the twin waves of anti-incumbency and momentum from the parliamentary polls, the UDF aims to snatch at least 30 panchayats and three municipalities.

Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate (ACJM) Elsa Catherine George had earlier remanded Mr. Easwar in judicial custodyafter the Thiruvananthapuram City Cyber Police arrested the right-wing activist and television commentator on the charge of defaming and revealing the identity of the woman who had accused Palakkad MLA Rahul Mamkootathil of serial rape and coerced termination of pregnancy. Mr. Easwar had declared a hunger strike in prison. He attempted to create political theatre by reiterating that he would continue to support Mr. Mamkootathil. The court ordered the Central Prison authorities to ensure Mr. Easwar received medical attention. Subsequently, prison officials transferred Mr. Easwar to the Government Fort Hospital. The district court posted Mr. Easwar’s bail plea for further hearing on Saturday. Another accused in the case, Sandeep Varier, a KPCC general secretary, has moved the court for anticipatory bail. The FIR registered at the city cyber crime police station also names two Mahila Congress leaders, among 20 others, including Mr. Mamkootathil’s vocal social media supporters. The prosecution’s case was that Mr. Easwar defamed the woman and outraged her modesty in public to intimidate her criminally, allegedly to dissuade her from pressing charges against Mr. Mamkootathil. The State-side also accused Mr. Easwar of procuring, storing and publishing the photographs and particulars of the woman through Facebook and other social media platforms on various dates. Notably, the prosecution indicted Mr. Easwar for repeatedly slurring the woman’s integrity and making vulgar and sexual remarks against her.

376,2025,The Hindu,376,"Parasitic plant presumed extinct rediscovered in Kerala’s Wayanad district A parasitic plant with vibrant orange and yellow flowers that was long thought extinct in the wild has been rediscovered after around 175 years from Kerala’s Wayanad district. Researchers have identified the plant, first collected and described in 1849 from Naduvattam in Tamil Nadu by the Scottish Botanist Robert Wight, asCampbellia aurantiaca(familyOrobanchaceae). The plant has now been rediscovered from a forest region that lies less than five km from Chooralmala and Mundakkai, the sites of the deadly landslides of July 30, 2024. A paper on its rediscovery by Salim Pichan of the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation; Jose Mathew, P.T. Arunraj and V.N. Sanjai from the Department of Botany, Sanatana Dharma College, Alappuzha, and B. Gopallawa from the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka, has been published inKew Bulletin, the official journal of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, England. Although Wight had established the genusCampbelliawithC. aurantiacaas its type species, its taxonomic status had become entangled in uncertainty due to divergent interpretations by subsequent taxonomists. The big challenge before the present-day researchers was verifying beyond any doubt that plant specimens collected in 2022-23 from the Thollayiram forest region in Wayanad was indeed the one described by Wight. What made their task a complex one was the absence of credible sightings or collections since Wight’s description. For over a century and a half, this had led to widespread misinterpretation of the plant’s characteristics. “It was frequently assumed to be synonymous withChristisonia bicolor, a species found in the Western Ghats and Sri Lanka. The resulting ambiguity — including whether Wight’s genus Campbellia was merely a misdescription of the genusChristisonia– precluded a clear understanding of the plant,” Dr. Jose Mathew said. Campbellia aurantiacain its habitat.

The petitioner, who identified herself as a 23-year-old Non-Resident Keralite, emailed Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president Sunny Joseph, MLA, accusing Mr. Mamkootathil of raping her after inviting her to a resort to discuss a prospective marriage. Mr. Joseph forwarded the complaint to the police, which he stated had no date, reference or the petitioner’s details. The email, circulated to journalists, states that KPCC’s “repeated denial” of the existence of earlier complaints of sexual misconduct against Mr. Mamkootathil had “obligated” her to “ensure that the truth is known to protect other women from harm.” Mr Joseph reiterated that his office was unaware of any pending complaint against Mr. Mamkootathil. The emailer stated that the social media persecution of Mr. Mamkootathil’s alleged victims had precluded her from coming out in the open. She said her details were “available with the Crime Branch.” The writer also requested Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to ensure that Mr. Mamkootathil holds no public role that entails interaction with women and children. His removal, she wrote, would empower other alleged survivors to seek justice without fear of retribution. The emailer also accused Congress leader Feni Ninan, Mr. Mamkootathil’s associate and UDF candidate in the eighth ward of the Adoor municipality, of having driven her to the resort where Mr. Mamkootathil allegedly raped her.

Abdurahiman, the chairman of the party-run Karassery Service Cooperative Bank at Mukkom in Kozhikode, for engaging in “anti-party activities” by hatching a conspiracy with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] to take control of the bank. A note dated December 2 from KPCC president Sunny Joseph said Mr. Abdurahiman was found to have committed “gross mistakes”. The KPCC decision follows a proposal from the Kozhikode District Congress Committee (DCC) to take strong action against the cooperative sector veteran. DCC president K. Praveenkumar had alleged that he had “cheated” the party. The Karassery bank had been under the control of a Congress-led director board for over two decades. It is headquartered in Mukkom and has five branches and two sub-centres in Kozhikode district. The bank was taken over by an administrative committee under the Department of Cooperation of the Kerala government on December 1 after an audit report highlighted gross lapses in the disbursement of loans. The incumbent administrative committee controlled by the Congress, which had its tenure till 2027, was disbanded as well. The Cooperation department also claimed that there had been complaints about the bank’s functioning, which turned out to be true after official inspections. However, according to local Congress leaders, Mr. Abdurahiman had “created a situation conducive” for the CPI(M) to take over control of the bank. Of its 13 directors, nine were planning to move a no-confidence motion against him, claiming that he had been taking unilateral decisions without consulting the director board. Between November 29 and November 30, over 800 new ‘A’ class members or shareholders were added after illegally using the login ID and password of the staff of the Nellikkaparamba branch.

Judge Shibu M.P. who found the accused Sathyaraj, 53, of Vembayam, guilty of the crime, also slapped a fine of ₹25,000 on him. According to the prosecution led by Special Public Prosecutor Ajith Prasad J.K., the incident occurred on August 4, 2023, under the Aryanad police station limits when the Class IX student had boarded the bus on her way to school. The conductor, attached to the Nedumangad depot, deliberately touched the girl inappropriately while moving inside the bus. The child, who initially assumed it to be accidental, stepped aside. But, the conductor repeated the act. The student later informed her school authorities, who then alerted the Aryanad police. The court observed that a bus conductor, who is responsible for ensuring the safety of passengers, had grossly misused his position. The court imposed the sentence after accepting the prosecution’s argument that the act was grave and warranted the maximum possible punishment.

He made the declaration during the ‘Vote Vibe- 2025’ programme organised by the Thrissur Press Club on Tuesday. “I will contest 100 %. If needed, I can even tell you the constituency,” he said, adding that it would be Nemom. His announcement comes even before candidate discussions have officially begun within the party. Responding to a query on whether Congress MP Shashi Tharoor  would join the BJP, Mr. Chandrasekhar said he had no such expectations. Mr. Chandrasekhar had contested against Mr. Tharoor in the Lok Sabha elections from Thiruvananthapuram, securing a significant lead in the Nemom segment. Nemom holds special significance for the BJP — it was from here that the party won its first-ever MLA seat in the State when O. Rajagopal emerged victorious in 2016. In 2021, Kummanam Rajasekharan lost the seat. It is at present represented by Minister V. Sivankutty. Criticising the performance of local bodies, Mr. Chandrasekhar said governance in the State had been stagnant for 20–25 years. “There is no forward-looking plan, including in Thrissur. Unplanned expenditure in the local bodies stands at 30–40%. There is no road map to address issues affecting people,” he said. He added that if elected, a BJP-led administration would bring a change in governance style. “We will implement digital governance and deliver all services at people’s doorsteps.

For both the major fronts, increasing their tally in the local bodies in the district is crucial as the results could be crucial in setting the political narrative ahead of the Assembly elections due in months. A traditional Congress bastion, Ernakulam sided with the UDF in the 2020 local body polls even amid what looked like a Left wave, though it could not retain the crucial Kochi Corporation. The major challenge for the UDF, hence, this time is to wrest the Corporation at any cost. That the district is the home turf of Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan, who is also overseeing the UDF campaign in the Kochi Corporation, makes it all the more important, amounting to a do-or-die battle, for the Opposition front. For the LDF, retaining the Corporation should be the key as it could be interpreted not just as a validation of its governance both in the State and the local body, but also as a big question on Mr. Satheesan’s perceived election management skills. .

A Bench headed by the Chief Justice of India Surya Kant directed Kerala to make a representation, if not already made, with the ECI, detailing its reasons for seeking an extension. The representation should be filed with the ECI by December 3.  The court urged the ECI to consider the representation of the State “sympathetically and objectively” in the next two days. The Bench, also comprising Justice Joymalya Bagchi, took into consideration the submissions by the State government and political parties that the local body elections, essential for grassroots democracy, should be allowed to be conducted without any hitch. Kerala is on the cusp of elections to its 1,200 local self-government institutions made up of 941 gram panchayats, 152 block panchayats, 14 district panchayats, 87 municipalities, and six corporations. There are a total of 23,612 wards heading for polls in the State.

Madhavi Devi of Telangana High Court on Tuesday (December 02) directed the Registry to place before the Division Bench a batch of six writ petitions seeking re-determination of reservations for different categories in some gram panchayats in the State. The different petitioners pointed out the strange situations of no persons belonging to specific communities like Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Castes being present in a village and still the posts of sarpanch and ward members being reserved for those communities. ‘By conducting elections to these villages in such circumstances, the very purpose of elections and the democratic values would be defeated,” the judge observed. Justice Madhavi Devi also noted that “any direction to reserve the said posts for any other class or category would affect the roster to be followed and it would have wide ramifications”. In the backdrop of the peculiar facts and circumstances cited in the batch of pleas, conducting elections in these villages would result in loss to exchequer with no purpose being served. In one of the pleas, the petitioner informed the bench that the post of sarpanch and ward members in Mahmoodpatnam gram panchayat in Kesamudram of Mahbubabad district for the SC. But there were no members from the SC in the village. In this backdrop, the election should be suspended, the petitioner urged. The panchayat election notification, with reservations for the SC and the ST as per 2011 census and for the Backward Classes based on SEEEPC-2024 (Socio-Economic, Education, Employment, Political and Caste survey), was issued.

She attributed the improvement to reforms such as strengthening the 1930 helpline, enhancing the ‘put on hold’ mechanism, and developing a model refund system with the support of the High Court. Ms. Goel described the campaign as a people-centric movement combining on-ground outreach with extensive digital engagement. Each week of the campaign focuses on a specific theme, including reporting to 1930, ‘digital arrest’ fraud, investment scams, hacking threats, identity theft, and online safety for women and children.

The non-filling of vacancies of the ALPs has resulted in loco pilots being forced to work for long hours causing health issues, complained loco pilots. This has also resulted in inconvenience to the public. V.

Also, the loco pilots are demanding 16 hours rest in headquarters along with 30 hours of periodic rest.

And as the arts get increasingly south Chennai-focused, I look back at a time when the venues were all in north Madras. But there was a time even before that, when locations were truly out in the open, public spaces as it were. And to get a flavour of those, and in the late 18thand early 19thcenturies, we need to turn to theSarva Deva Vilasa. This Sanskrit work, whose author is unknown, is available only as an incomplete text to us, preserved in the Adyar Library. It was Dr. V. Raghavan, who took pains to go through it, and give us a commentary, which after being serialised in the Adyar Library Bulletin in 1957/58, was brought out as a book by the Theosophical Society. Reading it, we get an idea of the arts scene in the Madras of the late 1700s and early 1800s. Rather like the industrial houses and corporates that support the arts now by way of CSR funds, and make the December Season possible, support then was by way of the dubashes – fabulously rich and with retinues of performing artistes. When not busy with transacting on behalf of their colonial masters, the work shows them going off to various orchards and estates outside the city (then Black aka George Town) where they enjoyed scholarly debates and music/dance performances.

Likewise, those of former President Saddam Hussein were brought down in Iraq after the conquest by the U.S. and allied forces of the west Asian country in 2003 or those of Bangladesh’s first President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman or Syria’s former President Hafez al-Assad in 2024. In India, around the time of Independence, a trend caught on among people who had advocated the removal of statues or memorials viewed by them as despicable remnants of the British past. However, what is not discussed much is that Madras (Chennai) witnessed, even about 100 years ago — that too, when the British Raj was thriving — an intense agitation to remove the statue of a British military officer, James George Smith Neil. Located at what is now called the Spencer’s junction - the intersection of Mount Road (now Anna Salai) and Binny Road, the statue had served as an important landmark of Madras for over 75 years in the later part of the 19thCentury CE and the early part of the 20thCentury CE. During the Great Revolt of 1857, Neil, who was attached to the Madras Fusiliers, played a role in putting down the rebels brutally but died in service. However, for Indians, he was the “Butcher of Allahabad [now known as Praygraj].” As a mark of his memory, a bronze statue, made in Scotland, was installed in August 1861, the cost of which (₹18,953) was borne mostly by the British. For 55-odd years, Madras city did not protest “Neil’s presence.” But, by the later part of 1920s, patriotic fervour was on a revival, after a spell of inertia.

Deepakto implead himself in a writ petition filed by his sister J. Deepachallenging the recovery of income tax and wealth tax dues, to the tune of ₹13.69 crore, by her aunt. Justice C. Saravanan permitted him to be impleaded as one of the parties to the case after he filed an affidavit stating that he came to know about the case filed by his sister only through a news report published inThe Hinduafter the previous hearing of the case on October 15. The impleading petitioner’s counsel S.L. Sudarsanam said the High Court had declared his client as well as his sister as the legal heirs of their aunt who had died intestate and therefore, it was necessary to hear him too before taking any decision on his sister’s writ petition. According to A.P. Srinivas, senior standing counsel for the Income Tax department, the Tax Recovery Officer had initially passed an order on July 23 this year for recovering a much larger sum of ₹36.56 crore, assessed to be the arrears to be paid by the former Chief Minister from the assessment years 1991-92 to 2011-12, from the two legal heirs who had inherited her properties. Ms. Deepa filed a first writ petition on August 7, 2025 challenging the recovery on the grounds that any notice, assessment, or recovery proceeding issued in the name of a deceased person was wholly void ab initio and unenforceable and that the writ petitioner could not be termed as an assessee in default. She also contended that no computation sheet had been furnished to her though many tax case appeals, regarding her aunt’s tax dues, were still pending. However, during the pendency of that writ petition, the Tax Recovery officer issued a revised recovery order for a lesser amount of ₹13.69 crore on August 4, 2025.

In the pre-database era, loan defaults would not show up against your name on the computer screen. Yet, such bad debt-clearing history had the potential to haunt the defaulter many years later as this case establishes. In 1973, K. Ponnusamy was working as a lecturer at a Government Arts College in Tamil Nadu. He availed a crop loan of ₹13,000  from the Bank of India but failed to repay the loan. The bank moved the court and collected the amount. Madras HC orders release of former Minister K. Ponnusamy’s seized properties Subsequently, in 1985, he borrowed ₹5,000 from a colleague R. Palanivelu, after executing a promissory note. He defaulted on this loan too. The lender had to file a suit on which a decree was passed. Even then, the money was not repaid. Eventually, the decree amount was recovered from his salary. In later years Mr. Ponnusamy’s personal fortunes were on the upswing. He had become a familiar personality in Tamil Nadu in 1991, when he was elected to the Assembly from the Marungapuri constituency in Tiruchi district on an AIADMK ticket. Riding on a sympathy wave triggered by former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination, J. Jayalalitha (as her name was spelt then) became the youngest Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. She appointed Mr. Ponnusamy the Deputy Speaker of the Assembly on July 3. Two years later, on May 17, she inducted him into her Cabinet and allotted the Education portfolio. He held the post till May 9, 1996, when the AIADMK was thrown out of power following a strong anti-corruption wave. The new M. Karunanidhi government registered corruption cases against Jayalalithaa, her confidante Sasikala Natarajan (now V.K. Sasikala), former Ministers and others.

By August, the government shortlisted two sites—one near Uchipulli and another near Keelakarai. Subsequently, the government had requested AAI to carry out a pre-feasibility study to study the pros and cons of both sites. By the end of October, a team from AAI visited the villages around the two sites. The first site Uchipuli, villages close by include Perungulam, Kumbaram and Valantharavai. In the second site located close to Keelakarai, the neighbouring villages include Manikaneri and Mayakulam, he added. “Both the sites seem feasible now. The first site near Uchipuli is situated near INS Parundu, an Indian Naval Air Station. If the State government chooses this site, then they will need approval from the Indian Navy,” he said.

The council added that its consent had been “obtained under pressure” and withdrawn formally soon after in a letter to the government.

But today, she spends at least an hour every day returning to the 64 squares, plotting strategies she once thought she could never grasp. Her confidence grew as she realised she was no outlier; around 70 of the 150 students in Classes 7 and 8 at this government school, located nearly 300 km from Hyderabad near the Chhattisgarh border in a region known for Maoist activity, have been now gathering around the chequered boards daily, turning chess into an unlikely routine on campus. Using digital boards available on campus, the school’s physical director, Tellam Rajyalaxmi, has been coaching the children consistently. Several players come from the predominantly Koya tribal community, and for many of them, this is the first structured game they have ever learned. What is unfolding in Wazeedu reflects a small but telling slice of amuch broader shift across Telangana, where government schools, colleges and public institutions are steadily embracing chess. This growing interest is largely driven by the Chess Network, a non-profit supported by committed NRIs who view the game as a powerful educational tool that strengthens cognitive skills while steering children away from digital distractions. “I participated in a chess tournament organised by Chess Network during the Bathukamma festivities in Hanamkonda.

Roughly one-third of households benefited from the Balika Poshak Yojana, which provides school uniforms for girls, and about one-fifth availed the Swayam Sahayata Bhatta Yojana, offering a monthly allowance of ₹1,000 for unemployed youth seeking work.

Nagar, you enter a bustling street, lined with shops, that is fairly well paved and accompanied by proper footpaths, barring the occasional broken ones. But as you move towards the Duraisamy Subway, you are greeted by traffic so chaotic that you are forced to inch forward cautiously and manoeuvre through a maze of vehicles. This is especially true during peak hours and the monsoon season. The subway road, afterall, is infamous for chronic flooding and poor maintenance. What adds to the problem are the illegal U-turns taken by motorists coming from the service lanes of the subway road. “Ideally, when you enter Duraisamy Road from the service lanes to head toward the Mambalam side, you are supposed to go all the way up to Saravana Elite, take a U-turn, and return. But nobody has the time, so they end up taking a U-turn directly from the service lanes,” says an autorickshaw driver. This means that traffic often moves at a snail’s pace during peak hours — usually from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays. Weekends are no better, as the street sees equally chaotic traffic, with T. Nagar being a shopper’s den. The traffic police should strictly enforce one-ways on the service roads, so that traffic movement is not affected as much, said Suresh Rodrigo, a shop owner in the area. “Moreover, during peak hours and weekends, customers struggle with parking in the area,” he added. Often, when heavy vehicles such as large trucks and lorries pass through the subway road, despite it being a crammed space, traffic gets disrupted, observed another motorist. A traffic police personnel, on condition of anonymity, said that U-turns from the service lanes are not permitted. “Since the subway road lies on lower ground, vehicles tend to slow down as they ascend and descend the slope.

433,2025,The Hindu,433,"The mirage of port-led development in Great NicobarPremium Among the backers ofa seaport at Great Nicobar— much in the media spotlight, following a spate of critical commentaries — a favourite argument is that the facility will position India as a regional hub for maritime security and economic growth. Proponents reject suggestions that the port is a misguided venture that threatens indigenous communities and risks ecological collapse. Instead, they present it as a strategic and commercial game-changer. That claim is increasingly questionable. A closer look reveals that the project’s supposed advantages are overstated, while its structural flaws and environmental costs are routinely, often wilfully, downplayed. At stake is not just the port’s ecological and commercial viability, but whether the sweeping claims of economic and strategic transformation attached to it are grounded in reality. The supporters’ logic is, at one level, understandable. India remains heavily dependent on foreign ports, especially Colombo and Singapore, for transshipment. The argument is that a mega port at Galathea Bay (Great Nicobar) would allow India to wrest traffic from foreign hubs and claim a greater share of regional container trade. Yet, the proposition rests on the faulty assumption that creating port capacity automatically attracts traffic. The experience with the Vallarpadam Port in Kerala suggests otherwise. Transshipment hubs flourish not on infrastructure alone but on network connectivity, feeder links, cargo base and carrier loyalty — none of which can be assured by merely building a high-capacity terminal. Galathea Bay suffers from deep structural limitations. It has no real hinterland — no urban centre, industrial zone, or logistics base to support the port. Every container must be shipped in and out, with no local industry or cargo base to anchor sustained growth. Even as a transshipment hub, the port would depend on feeder services that do not yet exist.

Cloudflare’s systems support a wide swath of internet traffic, and a breakdown on its network reverberated globally. But just how big is Cloudflare’s footprint on the internet, and what does “running on Cloudflare” really mean for websites, enterprises, and users?

The company serves on average 81 million HTTP requests per second across its network. An HTTP request is a query by a client, like a web browser, to a server, like in this case Cloudflare. Independent usage-tracking sites report that Cloudflare is used by roughly 20.4% of all websites worldwide as a reverse proxy.

437,2025,The Hindu,437,"The caste and class factors in the NDA’s victory in BiharPremium The landslide victory of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the 2025 Bihar Assembly electionshas created a perception that the voters have risen above caste and class considerations while exercising their franchise. This perception requires careful assessment based on evidence. One reason for this perception is that the NDA managed to win a large number of seats with a sizeable share of Muslim voters and also seats in a significant number of Scheduled Caste (SC) reserved constituencies. As a result, some people believe that the Muslim vote and the Dalit vote has shifted in favour of the NDA. It is important to understand that a party manages to win seats with a large concentration of voters of particular communities on account of two factors: one, of the people of those communities voting for the party or the alliance in a big way; and two, of counter-mobilisation — people of non-dominant groups in that constituency voting for that party or alliance in large numbers. In Bihar, while the NDA benefited from the support of voters of a particular community in some Assembly constituencies, it also benefited from the mobilisation of voters of non-dominant communities in those constituencies. An analysis of survey data (using PollsMap data) suggests that while Muslims and Yadavs were polarised in favour of the Mahagatbandhan (MGB), there was also a counter mobilisation of a large number of voters of other castes/communities in favour of the NDA’s candidates. This also helped the NDA candidates win from Muslim-dominated seats. In this election, the Yadavs remained slightly less polarised in favour of the MGB compared to the 2020 Assembly elections. Among the Yadavs, 74% voted in favour of the MGB, while only 19% voted for NDA candidates. During the 2020 Assembly elections, 84% of the Yadavs had voted for the MGB. Similarly, there was some decline in Muslim support for the MGB as well. Nearly 70% of the Muslim voters voted for the MGB, while 7% voted for the NDA.

The letter, made public on Monday and sent to Mr. Yadav’s office as well, was in response to the Environment Minister’s article inThe Hindulast month, in which he defended the project that involves the construction of a trans-shipment port, an international airport, a township, and a power plant on more than 160 sq. km of land. This includes around 130 sq. km of pristine forest inhabited by the Nicobarese, a Scheduled Tribe (ST), and the Shompens, a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) whose population is estimated to be between 200 and 300.

The signatories said that Mr. Yadav’s figure of just 1.82% of the islands’ forests being used for the project was “mathematically accurate but ecologically misleading”, arguing that this figure was calculated keeping in mind the forest areas under all of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands archipelago, when in fact, the project area would take about 15% of the Nicobar Islands archipelago, which is different from the forests in the Andamans Islands.

Mohsin Naqvi then hands over a runner-up cheque to Salman Ali Agha. Following the close encounter, which India won by five wickets, Pakistan players delayed the post-match presentation proceedings for over an hour Unsurprisingly, Tilak Varma has been named as Player of the Match for his outstanding knock of 69 not out. “I just wanted to keep calm, do it for my country, and finish the game,” he says of his knock.

Mr. Ramesh, who was Environment Minister in the United Progressive Alliance government, said that Ms. Gupta’s petition contended that the certification of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands administration did not follow the 2006 Act in letter and spirit and, in fact, constituted a very serious breach of the law passed by Parliament in December 2006. “Thereafter, on February 19, 2025, the Union Ministry of Tribal Affairs, quite strangely, filed an affidavit in the Calcutta High Court submitting that it should be removed from the list of respondents,” the Congress leader said.

The lithoclasts ejected from the crater were found to be composed of sandstone and shale of the Mithakari Group, belonging to this geological period, he said. The Oligocene is a geological epoch that lasted from around 33.9 to 23 million years ago, marked by the expansion of grasslands, global cooling, and the evolution of several modern mammal species, including the first elephants, cats, and dogs. ""We visited the site on October 8-9 to assess the mud eruption reported on October 2. We had collected the mud sample and found that it belonged to the Oligocene age,"" GSI's Deputy Director General Santanu Bhattacharjee toldPTI. ""A total of four clusters of mud volcanoes consisting of several small vents have been observed, spread over an area of about 500 sqm with a height of about 2 metre at the centre. This marks a significant increase in the area of the eruption site from the earlier record of 100 sqm and height of one metre. All clusters of vents were continuously emanating liquid mud and gases,"" he said. Mr. Bhattacharjee said the surface temperature of the mud volcanoes ranged from 29.3°C to 30.07°C, with a pH between 8.0 and 8.3, indicating the weakly alkaline nature of the mud fluid. ""An oily blackish sheen was also observed at a few vents as thin layers on the surface of the muddy material,"" he said. When asked about the origin of the eruption, Mr. Bhattacharjee said that it could be attributed to several processes. ""This includes diapiric movement of over-pressured surface shale layers due to loading of terrigenous sediments, rapid subsidence or lateral tectonic compression, hydrocarbon generation in deep subsurface and expulsion of fluid from depth along deep-seated fracture/fault,"" he said.

If these barriers remain unaddressed, they will obstruct access to Lenacapavir for the marginalised communities most affected by the epidemic, said a group of healthcare activists, patients, and advocacy groups. Global numbers of new HIV infections have remained virtually unchanged for three years, indicating the need for more effective HIV prevention tools, deployed at scale as an urgent global priority, the group said in a statement. Although Indian generic manufacturers can supply lenacapavir at affordable prices, regulatory delays and patent filings by American biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences threaten to delay access globally, it said. Gilead Sciences developed lenacapavir as an innovative HIV medication and prevention option. The company sells it under the brand name Sunlenca for treatment, and more recently, under the name Yeztugo for prevention. Gilead has also licensed several generic manufacturers, including Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Hetero Labs, Emcure, and Mylan (Viatris), to produce and distribute generic versions of lenacapavir to lower-income countries.

Seeking the implementation of the Act that has been in the cold storage for more than four decades, members of the IFCSAP and the Arunachal Pradesh Indigenous Affairs Council said Chief Minister Pema Khandu “must finish what Prem Khandu began in 1978”. ‘Prem Khandu’ refers to Prem Khandu Thungon, the first Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh, who headed the Janata Party government for a  little over  four years from August 1975. “The Act is not against any religion. It is meant to protect all religions and preserve the indigenous cultures in the State,” IFCSAP president Emi Rumi said.

According to an order issued by SEC Secretary Taru Talo on Thursday (November 27, 2025), the polling personnel, hailing from Itanagar and Pasighat – where the civic polls will be held – will have to apply for the facility to their respective municipal returning officer at least three days before the scheduled polling date, and attach a copy of the election duty appointment order.

The MRO will retain the counterfoil of the ballot paper in a sealed cover for security and transparency, the order stated.

The rally was organised by the Indigenous Faith and Cultural Society of Arunachal Pradesh (IFCSAP). “More than 10,000 people took part in the rally to demand the implementation of the Arunachal Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act passed in 1978,” the organisation’s Vice-President, Pai Dawe, toldThe Hindu. The IFCSAP debunked allegations that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) patronised the rally. It also insisted that the Act was not against any religion. “It seeks to protect all religions and preserve the indigenous cultures in the State,” its president Emi Rumi said. The State’s Christians, however, said the “discriminatory and divisive” Act unfairly targets them. The Arunachal Christian Forum has been opposing its implementation. Dormant for decades, the Freedom of Religion Act was back in the spotlight in September 2024 when the Gauhati High Court, hearing a petition, asked the Arunachal Pradesh government to finalise its draft rules within six months. The rules have yet to be drafted. Chief Minister Pema Khandu said the court directive made it necessary to implement the Act that has provisions for imprisonment and fines for those found guilty of converting people by force, inducement, or fraud. Members of the IFCSAP said tribal people were increasingly converting to other religions, and without the Act in place, indigenous faiths would soon become extinct. According to the indigenous faith body, the number of Christians jumped from less than 1% in 1971 to more than 30% in 2011. During the same period, the population of those following indigenous faiths and other religions dipped from more than 63% to about 26%.

This week’s picks bring two very different journeys into reckoning. One traces a Viking warrior’s brutal path through war, loss, and vengeance until he stands at the threshold of atonement. The other accompanies a Buddhist monk and a foreign outsider across a Himalayan kingdom as democracy, media, and modernity knock on the door of a lifetime lived simply.Vinland Saga(available on Crunchyroll and Netflix) andThe Monk and the Gun(streaming on MUBI) are stories about history’s long shadow and what it demands when ordinary people try to begin again. Makoto Yukimura’sVinland Saga, has long been regarded by critics and readers as one of the most accomplished contemporary manga for its meticulous historical reconstructions and moving inward excavations. Set in the early 11th century, the story follows Thorfinn, a young Icelandic warrior who grows up chasing the man who killed his father. This Hamletian pursuit of revenge across England and the North Sea gradually expands into a broader chronicle of conquest, enslavement, and the human cost of war. As Thorfinn moves from battlefield prodigy to a man reckoning with everything he has done, the narrative traces his attempt to unlearn violence and imagine a life beyond the machinery of empire. The anime adaptation translates its gilded battle tableaux into sequences that obsess over what the violence leaves behind. The show’s first season revels in kinetic cruelty while the second turns its camera inward, staging Thorfinn’s undoing and slow repair as a study in moral apprenticeship. What feels most valuable about the adaptation is how it balances its spectacle and spiritual work.

Addressing a gathering in Itanagar, the capital of Arunachal Pradesh, after inaugurating energy, connectivity, and healthcare projects worth ₹5,100 crore, he said the revised GST rates would be easier on the monthly budget of families. “The new GST rates applicable from the first day of Navaratri have made essential items, such as kitchen supplies, educational materials for children, and footwear and clothing, more affordable,” Mr. Modi said, pointing out that his government had been consistently reducing Income Tax rates despite facing major challenges. After the simplification of the GST rates to just two slabs — 5% and 18% — many items have become tax-free, taxes on other goods have been significantly reduced, and building a home, purchasing a two-wheeler, dining out, and travelling have become more affordable, he said. “The GST ‘savings festival’ will be a memorable milestone for the people,” the Prime Minister said. Mr. Modi came down heavily on the Congress for its “longstanding tendency” to avoid difficult development tasks, which had adversely affected Arunachal Pradesh and the rest of the northeastern region. The region suffered the most because the Congress had neglected it for its challenging terrain, he said. “The Congress dismissed the habitations near the international border as ‘last villages’ to shirk responsibility and conceal its failures.

Baburaj, contesting from Ward 2 (Dalil), publicly levelled a series of allegations against the party leadership. Mr. Baburaj was expelled from the party this week for alleged anti-organisational activities while serving as the Kunnanangad centre branch secretary. He said that action was taken against him without seeking an explanation, and that it amounted to a violation of the party’s constitutional norms. Addressing the media, Mr. Baburaj said his decision to contest against CPI(M) area committee member K. Mohanan had triggered systematic attempts to isolate and tarnish him. He alleged that an “unspoken crisis” was unfolding within the party at Cherukunnu, where corruption, mismanagement, and favouritism were being overlooked, and that those who raised questions were sidelined and expelled. He cited the closure of the Cherukunnu Cooperative Hospital as a key example, demanding an independent inquiry into what he described as large-scale financial irregularities. The hospital, launched with lakhs of rupees raised through shares from the public, was later stripped of valuable medical equipment, which, he alleged, was sold to the Government Medical College, Pariyaram. “The public has a right to know what happened to an institution built with their contributions,” he said. Mr. Baburaj also claimed that he had been receiving threats over the phone and through social media since he filed his nomination. He said he intended to pursue legal action. The allegations come at a time when rebel voices are surfacing in several parts of Kannur district ahead of the local body election, signalling deeper internal strains within the ruling front at the grassroots.",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cpim-rebel-steps-up-fight-in-cherukunnu-levels-charges-of-corruption-intimidation/article70335129.ece

According to a statement issued by the district’s Superintendent of Police, Pankaj Lamba, the trio was arrested on Saturday (November 8, 2025) based on a case filed at the Ruksin police station under relevant Sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). The three are house masters Devendra Singh, 42, and Kangge Darin, 31, from Uttar Pradesh’s Mau district and East Siang district, respectively, and hostel superintendent Amar Singh Thakur, 51, from Himachal Pradesh’s Bilaspur district. They were arrested after the police examined witness statements, forensic evidence, and the sequence of events that led to the death of the Class 7 cadet. The boy was found dead on November 1 inside the premises of Sainik School at Niglok in East Siang district. His death triggered outrage after reports that he had sent a message to his sister before his death, alleging that seniors were torturing him. Members of the boy’s family alleged that he was subjected to “severe ragging and mental harassment” inside the hostel. The district police had earlier detained eight students of the school in connection with the case and produced them before the Juvenile Justice Board. Initially registered as an unnatural death, the case was reclassified under abetment-related provisions of the BNS after preliminary findings indicated the possible culpability of students and staff members.

Stalin to visit Varanasi to witness and experience the cultural and historic links between Varanasi and Tamil Nadu. “I have been inviting Mr. Stalin to attend the Kashi Tamil Sangamam every year; I invite him again to see how the civilisational ties between Tamil Nadu and Kashi are being celebrated,” Mr. Pradhan said. He was speaking at the inauguration of the fourth edition of the Kashi Tamil Sangamam in Varanasi, on Tuesday (December 2, 2025). Centuries ago, people from Varanasi visited Tamil Nadu, and Tamil people visited Varanasi. There was no language barrier, the Minister said. “Only vested interests create barriers. You can create artificial barriers and succeed in politics but not create a division among people in the name of language,” he said. The Kashi Tamil Sangamam, as envisaged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had created a “bridge of knowledge” and become a public movement, with expectations rising for the programme every year, Mr. Pradhan said. “We firmly believe that multilingualism is our strength and not a liability. Language is a primary tool for overcoming the colonial mindset. Kashi Tamil Sangamam is a valuable experiment in experiential learning,” he said.

The National Health Authority, responding to the allegation, said the State government restricted 263 super-speciality procedures in the empanelled private hospitals across Assam “to ensure the rational and optimal utilisation of Ayushman Bharat resources and to encourage greater treatment delivery through public hospitals”.

The Commission, chaired by Tribhuvan Prasad Tewary, a retired IAS officer, held the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) and the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuva Chhatra Parishad (AJYCP) primarily responsible for launching the Assam Agitation and its consequences. It, however, said that the Assamese people’s fear of being outnumbered by outsiders was real and envisaged by British administrators much before the organisations spearheading the agitation were formed. The anti-foreigners’ agitation was triggered in 1979 by the alleged entry of non-citizens, aka “Bangladeshis”, during the revision of electoral rolls for a by-election to the Mangaldoi Lok Sabha seat. The agitation ended when the Assam Accord was signed on August 15, 1985. The agitation claimed several lives between 1979 and 1985, but the killings spiked during the controversial three-phase elections held in February 1983, when the State was under President’s Rule. According to the Tewary panel’s report, 3,023 people were killed across 11 districts between January 1 and April 30, 1983. Making the report public on November 25, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said it was tabled in the Assembly in 1987 when the Asom Gana Parishad – now a minor ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party – was in power, but only the then Speaker was privy to it. The report said the decision to hold the elections could not be blamed for the outbreak of the violence of 1983. “The evidence produced before the Commission clearly brings out that the issues of foreigners, language, etc., have been agitating the minds of the people for the last several decades, exploding into violence on several previous occasions,” it said.

This, the doctors said, indicated the government’s attempt to remove a section of doctors and health workers from rural areas. “This abrupt decision, stripping about 22,000 health workers of job security, will deprive people in rural Assam of healthcare services,” Mridupavan Mahanta, the chairman of the party’s Health Service Cell, said on Tuesday (November 25, 2025).

Assam has 12 State medical colleges and an All India Institute of Medical Sciences. “Many medical colleges have been constructed in the name of improving healthcare in Assam.

It also highlighted non-submission of Utilisation Certificates (UCs) and annual accounts of several autonomous councils and other bodies. The CAG report on state finances for 2023-24, laid in the Assembly on Saturday (November 30, 2025), said the budgetary assumptions of the state government ""continued to be unrealistic and overestimated"" during the fiscal year, as it incurred an expenditure of ₹41,39,449.66 crore against grants and appropriations of ₹1,69,966.13 crore, resulting in overall savings of ₹30,516.47 crore. These savings stood at 17.95% of total grants and appropriations made for the year. The report said that ""the savings were notional, as the funds were not actually available for expenditure"", since the actual receipts were ₹1,38,830.79 crore against the estimated ₹1,65,215.70 crore. Out of the total savings, only 0.35% (amounting to ₹107.08 crore) was surrendered, which deprived the other departments from utilising the amount, indicating ""poor"" financial management.

Mr. Borah sought a disciplinary detention space within the House complex to prevent ‘repeated disturbances’ by some MLAs.

He claimed that thereport submitted by the governmentin the State Assembly on Saturday (November 29) on the demand for ST status was unable to convince that the rights of the existing ST communities would remain intact. A Group of Ministers (GoM) submitted its report in the Assembly on Saturday (November 29)on the demand for ST status by six communities—Tai Ahom, Chutia, Moran, Matak, Koch-Rajbongshi and Tea Tribes (adivasis). If these communities are granted ST status, they will come under reservation in education and jobs. Mr. Gogoi, the party’s deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, said in a post on X that the “Congress has supported the claim that six indigenous communities of the State must be declared as ST without affecting the rights and privileges of the existing ST groups”. An Assembly resolution to this end was passed during the last Congress government, he said, referring to a motion adopted under his father and Assam’s three-time and longest serving Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi’s administration. On the GoM’s report tabled in the Assembly, Mr. Gogoi said, “Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, while bringing a report to grant category-wise ST status, has been unable to show that the rights of the existing ST communities remain intact.” Students from the Bodoland University in Guwahati on Saturday (November 29) stormed the assembly hall of the BTC Secretariat and vandalised property during their protest against the Assam Cabinet’s approval of the report.

Tripathi in Delhi on Tuesday (December 2, 2025). Addressing a press conference, the Navy Chief said that the operation is still underway but did not disclose any more details for strategic reasons. He noted that it is already in the public domain that India’s rapid mobilisation and aggressive posturing, including the deployment of a Carrier Battle Group (CBG) in the northern Arabian Sea, altered the regional maritime picture almost immediately. “The Pakistan Navy remained bottled up — either in harbours at their air bases or hugging the Makran coast. It never ventured out. The Navy was ready to do whatever the situation demanded,” the officer said. The heightened security dynamic during those crucial days also had a tangible impact on Pakistan’s economy, he said. Major global shipping companies began avoiding Pakistani ports, while insurance premiums for vessels headed to Pakistan spiked sharply, drastically reducing the number of merchant ships willing to take the risk, the officer said. Highlighting the Navy’s operational footprint over the past year, the Naval chief said that since the last Navy Day, Indian warships have cumulatively logged 11,000 ship days and naval aircraft have flown 50,000 hours. The Navy has also maintained an uninterrupted anti-piracy deployment along the Gulf of Aden since 2008, with 138 ships having rotated through the mission so far. These vessels have successfully escorted more than 3,700 merchant ships of various nationalities and crew sizes. He added that since the escalation of the Red Sea crisis in November 2023, triggered by rising threats from non-state actors such as the Houthis, India has deployed 40 capital ships, along with their air-borne assets, for maritime security and escort duties.

We want to spread awareness about circular economy not just as a waste management issue, but very much to move the discussion upstream to product design and production, to turn it into such a way that the product lifespan is better. With a roadshow we want to spread awareness about it in different parts of India. Various cities will have different focus points. For example, in Ahmedabad, the most relevant sector will be textile, in Bengaluru it will be IT,” Kimmo Lahdevirta, Finaland’s Ambassador to India, told The Hindu during an exclusive conversation in Mumbai on Tuesday. India’s circular economy is expected to have a market value of $2 trillion and create 10 million jobs by the year 2050, as per the Government of India. Currently, the government focus is on waste management and recycling. Finnish Innovation Fund SITRA said the opportunities lie beyond waste management in several sectors. “It is hard to calculate circular economy, and put numbers to it. But switching to a circular model could bring $4.5 trillion in economic benefits by 2030, cut emissions, create stable jobs and open new green markets, as per UNDP. The way we look at it is, there is business potential everywhere. At present, more than 70% CEOs are interested in circular economy. They want to look at opportunities to add to the value chain, to close the loop and to make sure that the supply chains are secure in today’s international scenario. Saving costs is important to them. We aren’t calculating that as circular economy business.

A district police officer said the incident occurred at around 11 p.m. near Chillei village under the Mahur police station after armed members of the Hmar People’s Convention (Democratic), or HPC(D), intercepted a vehicle, fired two rounds in the air, and threatened the driver. “The armed men fired at the personnel from a nearby Assam Police Command Battalion camp who rushed to the spot after hearing the shots. One suspected militant was killed in the retaliatory response,” the officer said, requesting anonymity. The body of the man, identified as Modi Hmar from the district’s Jinam Valley, was sent to southern Assam’s Silchar Medical College and Hospital for an autopsy. “He is suspected to be a member of the HPC(D),” the officer said. The HPC(D) was formed in 1995 as an offshoot of the HPC, which came into existence in 1986 as a political party spearheading a movement for self-government in a part of Mizoram bordering Assam and Manipur. The HPC gravitated to an armed revolution until signing a peace pact in July 1994.

Elections to the 126-member Assam Assembly are due by May 2026. Congress leader Pawan Khera said the Chief Minister’s days were numbered because of misrule and large-scale corruption. “First of all, he will not return to power. He knows he will go to jail after the upcoming election,” he said. The Congress spokesperson said the UCC was undesirable for a diverse country like India. “This country is a collection of several belief systems, customs, traditions, and languages. You cannot try to impose one language, one system, one belief, and one faith on everyone,” he said. Mr. Khera accused the Chief Minister of damaging Assam’s identity and heading “the most corrupt government in the history of independent India”. He said people discuss corruption whenever the Chief Minister’s name crops up. “Under the BJP, Assam has changed the meaning of ABCD. Today, A is for Adani, B for betel nut, C for cattle, and D for drugs,” he said, referring to allegations that the government was evicting people to provide space for the Adani Group’s industrial units and patronising the smuggling of betel nuts, cattle, and drugs. Mr Khera claimed that the State Government, scared of the upcoming elections, was weakening the voting power of the people of Assam by including outsiders in the electoral rolls. He also challenged the Chief Minister to declare the assets acquired by his family members in the last five to seven years. State Congress president Gaurav Gogoi slammed the State government for pushing theanti-polygamy Bill, calling it an attack on India’s diverse cultural fabric. “Nagpur (headquarters of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) is dictating the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government to take such steps, including the attempt to impose the UCC,” he said.",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/assam/opposing-ucc-plan-congress-says-assam-cms-days-numbered/article70335506.ece

On November 25, the Assam government tabled the Assam Fixation of Ceiling on Land Holdings (Amendment) Bill, 2025, aimed at removing labour lines from the “ancillary land” category in tea estates. This would guarantee “land protection” for 3.33 lakh tea worker families across 825 tea estates in the State, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said. Labour lines are rows of dwellings for plantation workers in specified sections of a tea estate. The CCPA, which covers tea, coffee, rubber, and cardamom planters, pointed out that the Assam Plantation Labour Rules exclude the earmarking of any garden land to be apportioned as “patta” to be distributed. It also said that labour quarters and line areas are part of the statutory facilities mandated under the Plantation Labour Act, 1951, and cannot be converted into transferable land ownership. The planters’ body said the State government had acquired large areas from the tea gardens under the Assam Fixation of Ceiling on Land Holdings Act, 1956, and allowed these estates to retain land only for special cultivation of tea and ancillary purposes (factory, houses, hospitals, etc.). “...the land now available with the tea estates is residual land after surrendering the surplus land. Therefore, any further acquisition would adversely affect the long-term viability of the tea sector...,” the CCPA said. It, however, said that if any estate land is acquired, compensation must follow the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. The proposed amendment law prescribes compensation, but under its relevant section.

The Bill seeks to exempt the traditional buffalo fight, locally known as Moh Juj, from the purview of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. In a statement on Thursday, PETA India said the passage of the Bill plunged Assam into the dark ages. The Bill, it said, undermines the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, which prohibits forcing animals to fight and violates laws upholding animal rights. “The passage of this cruel Bill aimed at allowing vulnerable buffaloes to be beaten into charging at, wounding and bloodying each other takes Assam back to the dark ages,” PETA India’s senior policy and legal advisor Vikram Chandravanshi said. Following a petition by PETA India, the Gauhati High Court had quashed the Assam government’s standard operating procedure on December 27, 2023, which allowed buffalo and bulbul bird fights during the mid January Magh Bihu. Earlier, Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Minister Krishnendu Paul said that the original State Act dealing with cruelty to animals allows exemptions under specific cultural circumstances. In the Statement of Objects and Reasons, the government argued that Moh Juj has long been an intrinsic part of Assamese heritage, contributing not only to cultural preservation but also to the continuation of native buffalo breeds.

The proposed legislation was tabled in the 126-member House on November 25. “We will reserve the Bill for the assent of President Droupadi Murmu. I do not think the Bill will be denied approval, as the President is a woman,” Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said, pointing out that the Bill intends to protect women and compensate victims of polygamy. During the discussion on the Bill, he said the widespread belief that Islam inherently promotes polygamy was factually incorrect. Citing religious accounts, he said that Prophet Muhammad regulated the practice of multiple marriages and limited it to a man keeping four wives under strict conditions. “His line of thinking was not to promote polygamy but to curb excesses,” the Chief Minister said, insisting that under Islamic law, a man cannot take a second wife without the explicit consent of the first. “Minus the consent, a second marriage is not legally valid in Islam,” he told the House. He referred to several Muslim-majority countries that have restricted or banned polygamy. The Chief Minister further said the next step would be to introduce a Bill to implement the Uniform Civil Code in Assam. “If you cannot stop me from becoming the Chief Minister again (after the 2026 polls), I will bring in the Uniform Civil Code. This is my commitment to the House,” he said. The anti-polygamy Bill prescribes punishment of up to 10 years and heavy fines for individuals who conceal a previous marriage before marrying for the second time. Repeat offenders will face double the punishment. The Bill proposes up to two years in jail and a fine of up to ₹1 lakh for those who hide information about polygamous marriages from the police.

Airbus is the majority customer for Aequs and it supplies several components to the airplane manufacturer while Boeing, which came on board through an earlier acquisition in the U.S, currently accounts for 15% of the business, but is a growing chunk along with all other customers and verticals, according to Mr. Melligeri.

The students have been agitating since September 22 against the university’s Vice Chancellor, Shambhu Nath Singh, for alleged financial irregularities, mismanagement and lack of accountability. They shut down all services on the campus, including academic activities, from November 29.

Thrikkakara municipality had recorded the lowest turnout in 2020 (around 72%). The polling had gone down by nearly 6.22% in Thrikkakara compared to the total turnout in 2015.

He did not name the “murderer” and his accomplices while speaking during a discussion on the singer-composer-actor’s death during an adjournment motion moved by the Opposition. Speaker Biswajit Daimary allowed the motion on the Chief Minister’s request. Garg died while swimming in the sea off an island in Singapore on September 19. He travelled to the Southeast Asian country to perform at the 4th North East India Festival (NEIF). “They attacked me, asking how I could conclude Zubeen was murdered. But it is in the court’s record that this was murder. I repeat in the House that it was murder. One person murdered him, and others cooperated. We have booked four to five persons on the murder charge,” Mr. Sarma said. Seven people were arrested in connection with Garg’s death. They are NEIF organiser Shyamkanu Mahanta, Garg’s manager Siddhartha Sharma, DSP cousin Sandipan Garg, personal security officers Nandeswar Bora and Prabin Baishya, bandmate Shekhar Jyoti Goswami, and singer Amritprabha Mahanta. The Chief Minister said a “big story” involving the cultural icon started before the COVID-19 pandemic and indicated that his death was connected to financial dealings. “We have the evidence. That’s why I told the SIT to first file the charge sheet on the murder case on December 8 and then expand the inquiry so that nobody can escape,” he said, asking the Opposition members to keep faith in the SIT probe after they demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation. Mr. Sarma said the government believed Garg’s death was not a normal case on the very first day. “So, we registered a case under Sections 61 (criminal conspiracy), 105 (culpable homicide) and 106 (causing death by negligence) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita,” he said. “During preliminary investigation, the",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/assam/one-person-killed-zubeen-garg-others-cooperated-assam-cm/article70321346.ece

Both the Congress and the RJD are currently holding review meetings to assess reasons for the parties’ dismal performance in the Assembly elections. The Oppositionmahagathbandhansecured only 35 seats in the 243-member House, while the ruling NDA won 202 seats. Under the alliance, the Congress won only six of the 60 seats it contested in the 2025 Assembly election. “If they (Congress party) want to chart out a different political course in Bihar, let them do it. They will know their real strength,” RJD State president Mangani Lal Mandal told media persons in Patna on Saturday. Mr. Mandal further said that “RJD has a strong support base and RJD’s alliance partners only got benefited from it”. Earlier on November 28, some Congress leaders, in a review meeting in Delhi, had pointed fingers at the RJD for the party’s defeat, Mr. Mandal said. “If Congress party has no support base why RJD keep it under alliance. Mr. Mandal should raise such issues at proper party forum and not to the media,” said Congress spokesperson Asit Nath Tiwari.

Speaking toThe Hindu,Mr. Nabin said as decided under the Satellite Township Scheme, for the first time in 40 years, after Pataliputra and Kankarbagh, 11 new cities would be developed. Nine of them would be commissionerates. “Considering the increasing population and requirements of major cities, there is a need for planned, environment-friendly, modern, and theme-based townships,” he said. The Minister said the new cities would be based on various themes, such as education hubs and IT. “The new townships will include nine divisional headquarters cities, Sonepur and Sitamarhi (Sitapuram). The initiative will reduce population pressure on major cities, ensuring better basic infrastructure and scope for further expansion. Special emphasis will be laid on roads, traffic management, drainage, waste disposal, green parks, and residential areas,” he said. The nine divisional headquarters were Patna, Muzaffarpur, Bhagalpur, Gaya, Darbhanga, Munger, Saran, Saharsa and Purnia. “Committees will be formed to monitor the townships’ overall development. Under the scheme, the land pooling policy will be implemented, which will also benefit landowners.” “While new townships will be set up keeping in view all future requirements to ensure organised development, it is equally important to take measures for efficient management and sustenance of the existing cities.

513,2025,The Hindu,513,"Boosting Bihar’s GER: How readiness and recruitment can reshape higher educationPremium As Bihar emerges from a decisive political mandate, attention is turning to governance, growth, and opportunity. Yet one of the most critical levers of the State’s future remains largely outside the headlines: the condition of its higher education system. Despite being home to nearly 10% of India’s population,Bihar has only around 30 recognised universities, roughly 2–2.5% of the country’s total. This indicates a striking mismatch between population and institutional capacity. This mismatch has produced a quiet but consequential crisis: overcrowded colleges, low enrolment ratios (Bihar’s GER is 17.1% compared to India’s 28.4%), weak research ecosystems, and one of the highest students out-migration rates in the country. Every year, thousands of young Biharis leave to study elsewhere, taking with them their talent, spending, and long-term economic contribution, part of a wider migration trend that has seen nearly three crore Biharis working outside the State by 2025, roughly one in four adults. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has described a “crisis in institutional capacity” across Bihar’s universities, citing chronic faculty shortages, weak financial management, and delayed administrative processes. Even when universities are established, they often lack the systems and staffing to function effectively. A CAG report tabled in the Bihar Assembly in March this year said that between 2017 and 2022, 18% of the ₹22,576 crore budget was not used, pointing to “unrealistic budget proposals and inadequate financial control mechanisms”. It also found that 57% of teaching posts in 11 test-checked universities were vacant. An empirical study,Issues & Challenges Before Higher Education In Bihar,echoes this, highlighting low Gross Enrolment Ratios, poor pupil–teacher ratios, inadequate laboratories, and weak accreditation status.

The case originates from an August 2015 FIR related to dropping the acquisition proceedings of land acquired by the State government. It was registered under various provisions of the IPC and the relevant Section of the Prevention of Corruption Act at the Manesar police station in Gurugram district. The investigations were transferred to the CBI, which registered the case on September 15, 2015. Mr. Hooda, who was Chief Minister from 2005-2014, has sought quashing of the Panchkula CBI court's September 19 order dismissing his application for postponing the process of framing of charges. The CBI court fixed the date for the process of framing of charges from October 30, but Mr. Hooda challenged the trial court order in the High Court. Rejecting Mr. Hooda's argument, High Court judge Justice Tribhuvan Dahiya said, ""...the stay of trial against the co-accused (by the apex court) cannot be a ground to postpone the trial against the petitioner (Mr. Hooda) as well, since despite this stay, charges can be framed and evidence can be recorded."" Besides, he is not accused of the offence of conspiracy alone. There are also other offences under the IPC and the PC Act, the court observed. Asked to comment on the dismissal of his plea, Mr. Hooda told reporters the matter is sub-judice and he has complete faith in the judiciary.

Describing the incident as “clearly a deliberate act”, Mr. Hooda said the vehicle not only damaged his car but also endangered their safety. “The arrogance and impunity of someone who is supposed to be a guardian of law soils the uniform and reputation of the organisation,” he added, urging Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann and Director General of Police (DGP) Gaurav Yadav to take note.

In a statement issued in Geneva on Friday (November 28, 2025), the human rights chief said the latest constitutional amendment, like the 26th amendment last year, had been adopted without broad consultation and debate with the legal community and wider civil society. He added that the “hastily adopted” amendments undermined judicial independence and raised concerns about military accountability. The Foreign Office in a press release said that “like all parliamentary democracies, all legislation as well as any amendment to the constitution remain the exclusive domain of the elected representatives of the people of Pakistan”. “While Pakistan gives due importance to the work of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, it is regrettable that Pakistan's views and ground realities were not reflected in the statement issued,” it said. It said Pakistan remains “fully committed to protecting, promoting and upholding human rights, human dignity, basic freedoms and the rule of law as enshrined in the constitution”. “We urge the High Commissioner to respect the sovereign decisions of Pakistan's parliament and avoid commentary that reflects political bias and misinformation,” it said. Earlier this month, Pakistan's joint parliamentary committee of the Senate and National Assembly approved the 27th constitutional amendment bill with the opposition alleging that the government was sounding “the death knell for the Supreme Court”.

Taking a dig at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, he alleged that crime and unemployment are rampant in Haryana and that the government has failed on all fronts. Accusing the BJP of deceiving the people, Mr. Singh said, “The BJP had promised to provide ₹2,100 per month to every woman during the elections, but later announced that it would limit the scheme to only 20 lakh women.

Article 240 empowers the President to make regulations for the peace, progress, and good governance of certain UTs that do not have their own legislatures. The government’s attempt to introduce the Bill raised the fundamental question about the Centre’s attempts at overreach in the country’s federal structure. In November, the Centre proposed to include Chandigarh under the ambit of Article 240. As per a bulletin of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, the government intended to bring the Constitution (131st Amendment) Bill, 2025, in the upcoming Winter Session of Parliament, beginning December 1, 2025. It wanted “to align Chandigarh with other Union Territories without legislatures — such as the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, and Puducherry — when its Legislative Assembly is dissolved or suspended.” The backlash was swift and intense from Punjab. The government then clarified that it would not introduce the Bill this session. The fact that stakeholders learned about this move through parliamentary bulletins rather than any structured dialogue raised the suspicion that the government was adopting a unilateral approach to concentrate authority in New Delhi. The claim over Chandigarh — the joint capital of Punjab and Haryana — has been a sensitive and emotive issue since the Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966.

Punjab has been asking for the handing over of Chandigarh, pointing out that the Agreement of 1970 stated that the capital project area of Chandigarh “would, as a whole, go to Punjab,” which was a clear commitment from the Central government.

Four decades, after the first case was reported, the country has built one of the world’s most expansive and resilient national HIV prevention and treatment programmes. The National AIDS and STD Control Programme (NACP) has shown undeniable gains. New infections have fallen by nearly half since 2010, AIDS-related deaths have dropped by more than 80%, viral suppression now exceeds 97% among those on treatment, and India has transitioned entirely onto Dolutegravir-based regimens — placing it among the global leaders in treatment efficacy. However, there can be no room for complacency. As the country transitions into the NACP Phase-VI (NACP VI) for 2026-31, it must confront the reality that India’s epidemic is still evolving, and in some places, is accelerating. The overall low national prevalence of 0.20% masks emerging hotspots and newer vulnerabilities. States such as Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura and Punjab have reported rising incidence, driven largely by injecting drug use. Among people who inject drugs, HIV prevalence is 40 times the national average, with some hotspots reporting exponential increases. With an estimated one-in-160 chance of transmission from a single needle-sharing event, HIV epidemics linked to injecting drug use can spiral rapidly if not responded effectively. In addition, a growing proportion of new infections now occur among individuals acquiring HIV from casual or regular partners — signalling a shift beyond traditional “key populations”. India’s young demographic — 2.25 crore adolescents entering the 15-25 year age cohort annually — remains vulnerable with easy access to digital platforms, enabling risky sexual behaviour and substance use.

Yet, there is confidence in his stride as he submits his credentials to be appointed as the party’s Raipur Rural district president. He believes the Sangathan Srijan Abhiyan (SSA), which translates as organisation re-creation campaign – the Congress’s new experiment in leadership selection – gives workers like him a rare chance to break through entrenched hierarchies. “In the normal course of things, my age and relative stature would have gone against me,” Dewangan admits with a smile. An appointment process that sits neatly between “the usual nominations” and a full-fledged organisational election, the SSA involves neutral observers from other States shortlisting six potential contenders for the post of District Congress Committee (DCC) president. The 850 DCC presidents have become the focal point of the party’s revival programme. Under the DCCs, there are three other tiers: block-, mandal-, and booth-level leadership. The SSA was adopted in April at the Ahmedabad session of the All India Congress Committee (AICC), a central decision-making body that is at the top of the party’s organisational structure.

539,2025,The Hindu,539,"Neglect of Khadi after Independence led to unemployment, says Amit Shah Union Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation Amit Shah on Friday said that had successive governments after Independence not neglectedKhadi, the problem of unemployment would never have arisen in the country. Mr. Shah was addressing the ‘Khadi Karigar Mahotsav’ in Haryana’s Rohtak, in the presence of Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini. “During the freedom movement, Mahatma Gandhi used ‘Khadi’ to eradicate poverty, make the country self-reliant, promote the idea of Swadeshi, and achieve independence. Mahatma Gandhi initiated ‘Khadi’, which brought about a revolutionary change in the lives of millions of weavers across the country,” he said. He added that if the work undertaken in the last 11 years for the development of Khadi had been pursued consistently since Independence, unemployment would never have arisen. “When Mr. Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, he resolved to revive ‘Khadi’. After becoming Prime Minister, Modi Ji encouraged the people of the country to use ‘Khadi’. In 2014-15, the turnover of ‘Khadi’ and Village Industries was ₹33,000 crore, which has now increased to ₹1.70 lakh crore,” he said. At another event, after inaugurating the ‘Sabar Dairy’ Plant in Rohtak, Mr. Shah said that in the past four years, the Ministry of Cooperation, along with all State governments, has worked to strengthen the foundation of cooperatives. He said he was confident that by 2029, every Panchayat in the country would have a cooperative society. He further said that under White Revolution 2.0, more than 75,000 dairy societies will be set up across the country in the coming days, and the government will also strengthen 46,000 existing dairy cooperative societies. Mr. Shah also inaugurated a State-level exhibition on new criminal laws in Kurukshetra, where he said that for the third consecutive time, the people of Haryana had given the BJP a majority, and their governments had left “no stone unturned” in the State’s development. “In a State like Haryana, once ",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/haryana/neglect-of-khadi-after-independence-led-to-unemployment-says-amit-shah/article70122016.ece

Mr. Warring has tendered an “unconditional apology”, but the electoral damage may already have been inflicted as Opposition parties have accused the Congress of showing “disrespect” towards Dalits ahead of the November 11 byelection. An eight-time Lok Sabha Member of Parliament, the late Mr. Singh served as Union Home Minister and Governor of Bihar. The ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have sharply criticised the Congress following Mr. Warring’s remarks made during a recent election rally. On Tuesday, the National Commission for Scheduled Castes took suo motu cognisance of the episode, seeking an action-taken report from the Deputy Commissioner of Tarn Taran. The Punjab State Scheduled Castes Commission also took suo motu notice of the “casteist” comment, summoning Mr. Warring to appear in person on November 6. Commission Chairman Jasvir Singh Garhi said, “This matter has come to notice through social media in which the Congress Party’s Punjab unit president and Lok Sabha member from Ludhiana is making colour and caste-based comments towards the country’s late Home Minister and Dalit leader Buta Singh.” Sarabjot Singh Sidhu, the son of the late Buta Singh, has filed a complaint with the Senior Superintendent of Police, Kapurthala, demanding registration of an FIR against Mr. Warring under provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, including Sections 3(1)(r), 3(1)(s), and 3(1)(u), as well as relevant sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023.

The United Nations estimates that 40.8 million persons are living with HIV globally. Of these, 25,44,000 are in India. In 2024 India reported 68,450 new infections. Today, with the availability of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART), persons living with HIV, who have access to these medications do not fall sick with AIDS and research has shown that the life expectancy of those receiving ART and are virology suppressed is almost similar to those without HIV. While there are no vaccines to prevent HIV infection, with lenacapavir, a new, long-acting injectable anti-viral medicine, HIV can now be prevented if given twice a year as pre exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). However, India is yet to implement (PrEP), and this is a gap that needs rectification in order to achieve zero new infections. It quotes Winnie Byanyima, UNAIDS Executive Director, as saying: “The HIV response has already saved 26.9 million lives worldwide. With an HIV prevention revolution, we could end AIDS as a public health threat, saving many more lives.” With regard to funding, the withdrawal of the United States, disrupted treatment and prevention programmes around the world in early 2025.

Supported by State policies aligned with sustainable farming, the hill State is witnessing a quiet transformation that seeks to balance farmer welfare with environmental conservation. Sunil Kumar, 42, a farmer from Balakrupi village in Kangra district, expressed satisfaction after receiving a payment of ₹2.25 lakh for 25 quintals of turmeric this year. “Earlier, I used to sell naturally grown raw turmeric at ₹60 a kilogram locally. This time, the State government procured it at ₹90 a kilogram. I have been growing turmeric with natural farming techniques on five bighas of land. I am now increasing the area under turmeric to eight bighas, given the profits I have earned this year,” he said. “Natural farming has not only improved soil and plant health on my farm, but has also helped me reap better yields and profits than chemical-based farming,” he added. Mr. Kumar shifted to non-chemical natural farming three years ago after receiving training under the Himachal Pradesh government’s flagship Prakritik Kheti Khushhal Kisan Yojana (PK3Y), and now grows cereals and vegetables on his farm. Launched seven years ago, PK3Y promotes non-chemical farming practices. So far, 3.06 lakh farmers have been trained under the scheme, and 2.22 lakh farmers - including fruit growers - are practising it partially or fully on 38,437 hectares across the State.

The ECI on Sunday (November 30, 2025) announced the extension of the schedule of the ongoing SIR of electoral rolls in nine States and three Union Territories by one week. Senior West Bengal Minister Chandrima Bhattacharya and Barrackpore MP Partha Bhowmick held a press conference and said that Trinamool Congress was correct when it had pointed out that SIR was a hurriedly-held exercise. “From the Trinamool Congress, we have been repeatedly saying that the time given by the EC for SIR is not sufficient. Earlier it took two years, a process which they [EC] were trying to complete in two months. By extending the dates of SIR, they [ECI] have admitted their fault and whatever the Trinamool Congress was saying has proved to be correct,” Ms. Bhattacharya said. A few days ago, a delegation of Trinamool Congress MPs had met ECI officials at Nirvachan Sadan in New Delhi and raised five questions which included the deaths linked to alleged SIR-related stress. The Minister also raised the same question during the press conference and said the EC should take responsibility for the deaths during SIR. “40 people have lost their lives, they were all from West Bengal. What is the answer of EC to these deaths? Who will take this responsibility,” she asked. The deaths in West Bengal also include that of Booth Level Officers (BLOs) and the Trinamool leadership has blamed SIR for the casualties.

The Centre’s proposal to include the Union Territory (UT) of Chandigarh under the ambit of Article 240 of the Constitution, which empowers the President to make regulations for the UT and legislate directly, has raised a political furore in Punjab. The government will bring the Constitution (131st Amendment) Bill, 2025 in the upcoming Winter Session of Parliament, beginning December 1, 2025, as per a bulletin of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. Political parties, including the Congress, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), hit out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the proposed introduction of the Bill, which would bring Chandigarh in alignment with other UTs without legislatures. The claim over Chandigarh, the joint capital of Punjab and Haryana, has been a sensitive political issue ever since the Punjab Reorganisation Act of1966. Punjab’s Leader of the Opposition and Congress leader Partap Singh Bajwa took to social media to criticise the move. “Chandigarh was created in 1966 as Punjab’s capital, with the Punjab Governor serving as its Administrator for decades. Now the Centre’s 131st Amendment move to pull Chandigarh under Article 240 is nothing short of snatching the city away from Punjab – an open attack on history, federalism, and Punjab’s rights. The BJP govt is pushing a politically loaded Constitution (131st Amendment) Bill to recast Chandigarh like any other UT,” he posted on X. SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal asked the Union government not to introduce the Bill, pointing out that doing so would amount to “betraying and discriminating against brave Punjabis who had sacrificed the most for the country” and going back on all commitments made to Punjab to hand over Chandigarh to it. “It seeks to end Punjab’s claim to Chandigarh as its capital city,” he said in a statement.

These observations were made in a detailed order in connection with a writ petition challenging the policy. On August 7, the court granted an interim stay on its implementation and gave the State four weeks to respond to the concerns. The next hearing is scheduled for September 10. “The State proposes to take over tens of thousands of acres of fertile land in the entire State of Punjab for carrying out its proposed development work, without carrying out any Social Impact Assessment or Environmental Impact Assessment study, although a stand is taken that the assessment would be carried out later when they have definite information about the number of land owners who have opted for the scheme,” the court noted. It added, “It has been held by the Supreme Court in several cases that before permitting urban development, the State ought to carry out an environmental impact assessment.” The Bench also pointed out that the policy prescribes no timelines and provides no mechanism to address grievances of affected persons. “Payment of subsistence allowance has been provided to the land owners, but there is no provision for rehabilitation of those landless labourers, artisans and others who are dependent on the land,” it said. “It has also been submitted before this Court that the State’s statutory bodies shall themselves develop the land, but no budgetary provisions appear to have been made, nor anything has been put forth before this Court to indicate that the State has adequate resources to finance the development project under the policy,” the order stated.

The agency added that Pakistani handlers associated with the module systematically radicalised minor Indian teenagers by adding them to their Instagram group chats and attempted to disseminate ISIS ideology and violent provocative content through them. “Evidence has also emerged indicating that teenagers were being motivated to establish an ISIS module in Chhattisgarh,” the note added. According to the police, the “two ISIS-influenced teenagers” were identified as a result of the vigilance and continuous cyber surveillance of the ATS and related investigative agencies. ”Once it was clear that their activities were anti-national, a case under provisions of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 was registered and the two were apprehended,” police said.",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/chhattisgarh/chhattisgarh-ats-apprehends-two-minors-for-links-with-pakistan-based-isis-module/article70296211.ece

The statement comes following a series of surrenders by Maoists in different districts of the Bastar region throughout the week. The Centre has set a deadline of March 2026 for elimination of Maoism and Mr Sharma said that it would be achieved within the stipulated time. He said that anyone wishing to surrender and return to the mainstream is welcome, and the government will take full responsibility for their rehabilitation. The armed forces will continue to take action, the Deputy Chief Minister said. “Those who choose not to surrender and continue to take up arms will get an appropriate response from our well-equipped security forces,” he said. Answering a question on the future of Bastar once the Maoist issue is resolved, Mr. Sharma said that the government firmly believes the region’s ‘jal, jungle, zameen’ (water, forests and land) belongs to the people of Bastar, especially its youth. “A strong narrative is emerging that Bastar’s youth themselves will shape the future of the region. This is a matter of pride and immense satisfaction. The enthusiasm seen in ‘Bastar Olympics’ and ‘Bastar Pandum’ festival shows youth are ready to take charge,” he said, adding that legal provisions empowering gram sabhas would be implemented soon.",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/chhattisgarh/80-maoism-eradicated-in-chhattisgarh-deputy-cm-sharma/article70338838.ece

In a statement issued by the Raipur Zonal Office of the ED, the agency claimed that the list of attached assets include immovable properties in the form of 364 pieces of residential plots and agricultural lands worth ₹59.96 crore. It added that the movable properties in the form of bank balances and fixed deposits worth ₹1.24 crore were also attached. The predicate offence is a case under Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, which pertains to the alleged scam that purportedly took place when the State was being ruled by the Congress with Mr. Bhupesh Baghel as the Chief Minister. The police investigation has revealed that Chhattisgarh liquor scam resulted in a massive loss to the State exchequer and filled the pockets of the beneficiaries with Proceeds of Crime (POC) generated by the commission of scheduled offences, worth more than ₹2500 crore. On the money laundering angle and the specific role of Mr. Chaitanya Baghel, who has been in jail since July this year, the ED statement noted that “Chaitanya Baghel, son of Bhupesh Baghel, was positioned at the apex of the liquor syndicate”. “His position as the Chief Minister’s son made him the controller and ultimate authority of the liquor syndicate. He was responsible for maintaining thehisab(accounts) of all illicit funds collected by the syndicate,” it added.

Hidma — also known by various aliases such as Hidmanna, Hidmalu, and Deva — was one of the most notorious Maoist commanders active in Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana, according to the police, and was killed in an encounter with security forces in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh on Tuesday (November 18, 2025). “The neutralisation of six Naxalites, including top Naxalite leader and CC member Madvi Hidma, in a successful operation by security forces on the Chhattisgarh-Andhra Pradesh border is a decisive achievement in our fight against Naxalism. We salute the indomitable courage of our security forces for this,” Mr. Sai wrote on X. His post added that the surrender of hundreds of Maoists in the past few months, arrests of top cadres and continuous successful operations showed that Maoism was now breathing its last while also expressing confidence that with the joint strategy of the Centre and the State, “India will be completely Naxal-free by March 2026”.

The elation of victories paralleled the disappointments of falling short. During the open water swimming event, which was held under adverse weather conditions, parents were worried and were waiting on the shore for their competing children to safely return from the sea. Their concerns were drowned in the cheers of local people, volunteers and supporters for the children. The games were held on the blue-flag certified Ghoghla Beach near Diu town. Over 1,300 athletes from 31 States and Union Territories competed in six events — beach soccer, sepak takraw, pencak silat, open water swimming, beach volleyball, and beach kabaddi. Ironically, landlocked Manipur came out as the champions by the sandy shores of Ghoghla. Apart from the competition events, the hosts also put the U.T.’s own sporting talent on display on the final day of the games, demonstrating agility with Mallakhamb — a traditional form of gymnastics; strength with tug-of-war; and grit with boxing. The five-day event gave mediapersons a lot to deal with as photographers often had to deal with unwanted clutter in the background while looking for the perfect frame. Others would have to rival the decibel levels of booming speakers to get across to athletes. The natural lighting of dawns and dusks made covering the games early in the morning or late in the evening incredibly interesting, especially the events of beach kabaddi and sepak takraw, in which players were sort of flying over the sand to score points under the rising/setting sun spinning its own web.

India's technology services companies will also be impacted while business continuity will be disrupted for onshore projects that may require adjustments. “Companies will work closely with clients to adapt and manage transitions,” it added.

Adding to the madness of the narrative is the music, scored by Varkey and Sooraj Santhosh — 25 tracks in addition to scores of short pieces, which make it a musical.

In a letter to Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, PAV general secretary T. Kameshwar Rao and president MV Ramanaiah expressed serious concern at the government’s recent decision to hand over 10 newly sanctioned government medical colleges to private entities under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model. They drew the attention of Mr. Naidu to the fact that the NITI Aayog’s directive to establish one medical college per Lok Sabha constituency led to the sanctioning of 17 new medical colleges for Andhra Pradesh during the previous YSRCP regime. Five of these colleges have already commenced operations on a Letter of Permission basis, and two more in tribal and remote areas are progressing with full Central funding. However, the coalition government’s decision to transfer 10 of these colleges to PPP is a shocking betrayal of public trust. It not only distances poor and middle class youth from pursuing medical education but also pushes public health into peril by commodifying essential services. They alleged that the State government was trying to go ahead with the PPP policy making false claims on shortage of experts, infrastructure and funds as justifications. While each college requires about ₹500 crore for construction, the Central government is under obligation to provide 80% of funds while the State’s share of 20% can be raised through its own budget or loans from institutions like NABARD.

Addressing farmers at Kuruchi hamlet in Thirupanandal taluk in Thanjavur district, as part of his State-wide campaign ‘Tamil Nadu People’s Rights Retrieval Journey’, Dr. Anbumani said while the Centre offered ₹2,369 per quintal as the minimum support price (MSP), the State government added just ₹131 as ‘incentive’ to make it ₹2,500 per quintal. In neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, the State government offered ₹500 over and above the MSP and in Odisha the paddy farmers got ₹800 in addition to the MSP fixed by the Centre. The Tamil Nadu farmers were struggling to make ends meet since they realised just around ₹50 per quintal as ‘real profit’ in view of the steep increase in input and cultivation costs. Such being the case, it would not be proper on the part of Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation employees to demand ‘bribe’ for measuring the paddy at direct purchase centres. While urging the DPC staff to shed the practice of demanding bribe from farmers, he said the State government should enhance its contribution to make the per quintal purchase price in Tamil Nadu as ₹3,500, for the benefit of farmers. He also urged the State government to ensure that necessary infrastructure was available at the DPCs, so that not even a handful of paddy went waste due to vagaries of nature.

Abhishek broke the back of this chase early on with an astonishing assault on Shaheen Shah Afridi, before captain Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma took over to steer India to victory. For Pakistan, Saim Ayub and Abrar Ahmed put in a creditable effort with the ball, but it never had enough to make a game out of this second innings. Sufiyan Muqeem with what you would imagine is the last over of the match. SKY misses the sweep shot, but the umpire is unmoved. Pakistan reviews because why not? It’s not a bad review at all...but the wickets are umpire’s call so SKY survives. Launched over cow corner for six, andthat is that! India defeats Pakistan by seven wickets with 25 balls to spare! Saim to bowl out with India three hits away now. Surya sweeps it past a diving Shaheen for four more. Typically SKY shot as he chops a ball between point and short third for two more.

The majority of the recognised political parties that attended a meeting convened by the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO-Kerala) Rathan U. Kelkar stated that the general sentiment was against holding the SIR in Kerala. They also wanted Mr. Kelkar to urge the Election Commission of India (ECI) to put off the exercise until after the 2025 local body polls and include the ration card as a valid identification document. A major demand made by the political parties was that the latest rolls or the rolls used for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections should be used as the base document rather than a 23-year-old document. “Why do voters who already have electoral photo ID cards (EPIC) and their names in the latest rolls and who also have voted in the past five elections again have to fill in enumeration forms?” M.V. Jayarajan of the CPI(M) said, urging the ECI to use the 2024 Lok Sabha poll rolls instead. He also pointed out that a “Bihar model” SIR where lakhs of people faced expulsion from the list, cannot be accepted in Kerala. P.C. Vishnunadh MLA of the Congress said it was “impractical” to hold the SIR when Kerala was about to be in the thick of the 2025 local body elections.

The two enclaves were separate Union Territories till Parliament passed legislation in December 2019 and merged them. While Dadra and Nagar Haveli, a seat reserved for the Scheduled Tribes, has nearly 2.5 lakh voters, Daman and Diu, the smallest Lok Sabha constituency after Lakshwadeep, has fewer than 90,000.

The Union Territory’s capital, Daman, is adjacent to the industrial town of Vapi in south Gujarat, while Silvassa is the largest city. Diu is a scenic island along the Saurashtra coast. While Daman is an industrial town, on Diu, most of the population depends on fishing and tourism. Vanakbara in Diu is one of the largest fishing harbours on the Gujarat coast. The Dadra and Nagar Haveli seat had mostly remained under the control of the late Mohan Delkar, the MP who ended his life in February 2021 in a Mumbai hotel.

As a result, the bodies of animals higher up in the food chain accumulate  more microplastics and can suffer from amplified toxicity. This phenomenon is called bioaccumulation. To understand microplastic bioaccumulation along the Goan coast, scientists from the CSIR-National Institute of Oceanography in Goa and the Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research in Ghaziabad recently examined the habitats and feeding behaviour of 251 fishes belonging to nine species of finfish and shellfish. These included mackerel, anchovy, oyster, clam, catfish, sardine, and other commercial varieties, which the team captured from various depths in the ocean’s water column. In a study published inEnvironmental Researchin August, the team identified 4,871 polluting particles in these fish, of which 3,369 particles were plastic polymers of 19 types. The scientists also found more contamination on the sea floor and in sediments at the bottom of the water column (in benthic realm) than in the open water column (pelagic realm). These particles were mainly from degraded fishing material left at sea and wastewater discharged from human settlements. Based on the findings, the scientists have indicated that the fish are suffering from disrupted gene expression, oxidative stress, reproductive damage, and lower growth. When people eat these fish, according to the team, effects on the human body could include immune dysfunction, higher risk of cancer, and toxicity to the brain. Fisheries around Goa focus on the estuaries — ecologically critical zones that nourish young fish and which serve as feeding grounds for the older ones.

Mr. Jadhav said there is growing global recognition of Ayurveda as a holistic healthcare system. “The decision to fix September 23 as the permanent date for Ayurveda Day is historic as it aligns with the autumnal equinox, a symbol of balance in nature, which lies at the heart of Ayurvedic philosophy,” he said. He added that the celebrations marked a milestone in the Ministry’s efforts to promote Ayurveda as a system of health and well-being rooted in sustainability and natural living. Mr. Raju noted that in less than a decade, Ayurveda Day had evolved from a national observance into a global health movement, with more than 150 countries now celebrating it. He underlined the importance of preserving authenticity while leveraging digital platforms such as the NAMASTE portal and Ayush HMIS to enhance accessibility and evidence-based practice. The Governor also highlighted Goa’s potential to emerge as a hub for Ayurveda-based wellness tourism, and commended the establishment of the Integrative Oncology Unit at AIIA Goa in collaboration with the Tata Memorial Centre. Chief Minister Sawant emphasised Ayurveda’s relevance in tackling lifestyle-related disorders such as obesity, diabetes and stress.

Steam curls up from freshly ground rice flour, jaggery bubbles into a sticky syrup, and women gather around to coax delicate pleats into the steamed version of the modak orukadiche modak.

The festival table is not only about sweets but also about community feasts, seasonal vegetables, and rare ritual foods that are a testament to regional diversity, ancient wisdom, and the very spirit of community that Lokmanya Tilak, one of the country’s most prominent freedom fighters and social reformers, sought to foster when he initiated the tradition of public Ganesh celebrations in 1893. The offerings, known asnaivedya, are not a one-size-fits-all affair. They are rooted in the specific geographical and communal identity of the household. As food writer Saee Koranne-Khandekar documents in her bookPangat, A Feast : Food and Lore from Marathi Kitchens, regional ingredients and community practices dictate the festive menu. For example, while the Brahmin communities of the Desh region, the historical heartland of Maharashtra, might favour a sweet flatbread calledpuran poliand savoury lentil dishkatachi amti, the Pathare Prabhus of the Konkan coast have a tradition of including seafood — a practice that reflects their coastal environment and di",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/food/dining/why-ganesh-chaturthi-is-more-than-modak-exploring-maharashtras-culinary-traditions-rituals-and-recipes/article69975086.ece

The incident took place at around 1.30 am off Mobor beach in South Goa district, a senior police official said. The trawler had 27 fishermen who called the police control room for help. A team of coastal police, along with State-appointed lifeguards, and local fishermen, rushed for help, the police said. All the fishermen were brought to the shore early on Sunday (September 28) with the help of jet-skis used by lifeguards and locals who assisted in the rescue operation.

Later in the session, his 97-year-old mother-in-law and1942dialogue writer, Kamna Chandra, joined him on stage, along with producer-restorationist Yogesh Ishwar, who supervised the film’s 8K restoration in Italy. Among the highlights, Joshi reminisced over Chopra’s early years at the Film and Television Institute of India. Chopra recalled the time he won a National Award for his student filmMurder at Monkey Hill. “I thought I’d get ₹4,000,” he said. “Instead they gave me an eight-year postal bond.” He described confronting the then Information and Broadcasting Minister L.K. Advani about it. “I told him, ‘Why would you do this to a student?’ He said it would mature later. I said, ‘Sir, I need the money now,’” which cracked the audience up. Chopra said he was asked to come to Shastri Bhavan the next day, where Advani admonished him for his on-stage behaviour, told him to “call your father” and pushed the phone toward him. Chopra explained how the minister grew irritated as he questioned him in the office’s long corridors and large government rooms. Cornered, he deflected by abruptly asking, “Sir,aapne breakfast kiya hai?(Did you have breakfast?)”. The unexpected question broke the tension, leading Advani to order him eggs and parathas before sending him to Gol Dak Khana, where he finally received the ₹4,000.

Governor P Ashok Gajapathi Raju summoned the special session to elect the new Speaker, as the post fell vacant last month due to the resignation of Ramesh Tawadkar, who was inducted into the Pramod Sawant-led state cabinet. Mr. Gaonkar polled 32 votes against his rival Congress candidate Altone D'Costa, who was supported by only seven MLAs. Deputy Speaker Joshua D'Souza, who chaired the House proceedings, declared 66-year-old Gaonkar as the next Speaker of the legislative Assembly. Chief Minister Pramod Sawant and Leader of Opposition Yuri Alemao later escorted the newly elected Speaker to the Chair and congratulated him. The BJP, which has 28 legislators in the 40-member House, enjoys the support of the two MLAs of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party and three Independents. The Opposition comprises three MLAs of the Congress, two of the Aam Aadmi Party and one each from the Goa Forward Party and Revolutionary Goans Party. It had fielded Quepem MLA D'Costa as its joint candidate for the Speaker's election. This is the second time during the current Sawant-led state government that Mr. Gaonkar has occupied the speaker's chair. The two-term legislator was earlier nominated as a pro-tem speaker after the BJP won the 2022 Goa Assembly polls. Mr. Gaonkar had then administered the oath to all MLAs in the House.

608,2025,The Hindu,608,"Goa government does a U-turn on tiger presence in State The answer to whether tigers “reside” in Goa depends on who is asking the question. The Goa Government, earlier this year, argued before a Supreme Court-appointed committee that there was “...no permanent presence of tigers” in the State. However, in a separate matter concerning a dispute involving Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra over the sharing of water from the Mahadayi river in Goa, it stated the opposite. “...The State of Goa states that there is evidence to show that tigers in Goa are not merely transient animals, but are a resident population, and the forests around Chorla, Mann and Kankumbi comprise a contiguous tiger landscape corridor, to the Bhimgad Wildlife Sanctuary in Karnataka to its south-east and the Anshi Dandeli Tiger Reserve to its south that has around 35 tigers.” The latter appears in a 2018 report of the Mahadayi Water Disputes Tribunal. “Thus, were the flow of Mahadayi river to be impeded,” Goa argued,” it would impact the prey base as well as tiger ecosystem”. The issue of tiger presence (or absence) in Goa has come to the fore following the Goa Government challenging a July 2023 order of the Bombay High Court that directed the State to declare the Mhadei sanctuary and other connected regions — as recommended by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA, the nodal Central body tasked with overseeing tiger conservation) — a ‘tiger reserve’ within three months. The Goa Government filed a special leave petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court challenging this order. The Goa government’s core arguments in the SLP are that, as per the NTCA guidelines, an area of 800-1,000 sq. kms would have to be declared an inviolate space for a tiger reserve. The area already under protection in the State, in the form of parks and sanctuaries, added up to 745 sq. km. “Therefore, to declare an area larger than the already protected area an inviolate space would be an aberration.” Secondly, the area that would have to be declared a tiger reserve had a “huge popul",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/goa-government-does-a-u-turn-on-tiger-presence-in-state/article70318538.ece

The Prime Minister was addressing a gathering after unveiling a 77-foot-tall bronze statue of Lord Ram as part of Shree Samsthan Gokarn Jeevottam Mutt’s 550th year celebrations at Partagali, in Cancona, South Goa. It is the tallest statue of Ram in the world, as per the Goa government. “The restoration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, grand redevelopment of Kashi Vishwanath Dham, and expansion of the Mahakal Mahalok in Ujjain, all these reflect the awakening of our nation, which is advancing its spiritual heritage with renewed strength,” Mr. Modi said. “This renaissance will inspire future generations to stay connected to their roots,” he said. Referring to Goa’s history, Mr. Modi said there were times when Goa’s temples and local traditions had to face destruction. “It was the time when the language and cultural identity came under pressure. But these circumstances could not weaken the spirit, instead, they contributed to determination,” he said. “This is the uniqueness of Goa.

617,2025,The Hindu,617,"Supreme Court committee recommends phased creation of Goa Tiger Reserve A Supreme Court-appointed committee has recommended the creation of a tiger reserve in Goa, but in a phased manner, so as to first incorporate areas with a lower human presence. The top court is expected to consider the report of its Central Empowered Committee (CEC) in the next hearing of the case that involves the Goa government and the Goa Foundation, a non-government organisation. The CEC came into the picture after the Goa government challenged a Bombay High Court order of July 2023, which directed the State to notify five protected areas — the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary, Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary, Bhagwan Mahavir National Park, Netravali Wildlife Sanctuary, and Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary, collectively referred to as the “Mhadei WLS and Other Areas” — as a tiger reserve, within a period of three months. Also Read |Goa government does a U-turn on tiger presence in State The High Court had also directed the State Government to prepare a Tiger Conservation Plan and to determine and settle the rights and claims of Scheduled Tribes and other forest dwellers.

The Goa government was reluctant to have the areas be declared as a tiger reserve on the grounds that nearly “one lakh people” would be affected, though it later conceded in its own affidavit that there are are only about 1,274 households in the 33 villages within the five protected areas, translating to approximately 5,000 to 6,000 individuals.

When the aircraft began its descent at the Manohar International Airport (Mopa) in North Goa, a carpet of green stretched endlessly on either side, with hardly a hint of concrete in sight. Outside the terminal, Portuguese-inspired architecture and the iconic ‘Under the Coconut Tree’, a creation of the famed Goan cartoonist Mario Miranda, caught the eye. Driving out, the view remained unchanged for a few kilometres — verdant stretches and hills draped in tropical foliage — a landscape quintessentially North Goa. There couldn’t have been a better start to a trip that found its rhythm at the ‘Malhar and the Sea’ music festival. Goa is best known for its vibrant folk songs, distinctive Konkani art forms, and of course Fado — a legacy of its Portuguese past. But contrary to the common perception that classical music is not a significant aspect of its soundscape, the region has produced legendary Hindustani musicians such as Mogubai Kurdikar, Kishori Amonkar, Kesarbai Kerkar, Dinanath Mangeshkar, and Jitendra Abhisheki. Annual festivals are even held in memory of some of them. Folk queen Malini Awasthi brought the house down with her robust singing

The October circular had specifically banned the bifurcation of sites without following planning norms, warning that such violations result in revenue loss and reduce mandated open spaces.

Engineer Asim Majmudar, a native of West Bengal, and workers Somabhai Nayak, Bhemabhai Nayak, and Raghubhai Nayak, all residents of Gujarat’s Mahisagar district, died on the spot. The roller’s driver, Sahed Babulal, sustained injuries. The complaint was filed by Somabhai Nayak’s son, who said his family had been working as labourers on the highway project for the past year. On Tuesday night, most of them returned home, while Somabhai and a few others stayed back to repair potholes, he said. The police have booked the truck driver — who fled after the crash — under sections 106(1) (causing death by negligence), 105 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 281 (rash driving), and 125(A) (endangering life or personal safety) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.

635,2025,The Hindu,635,"PM Modi attacks Congress for neglect of tribals, says Bihar voters rejected caste politics Prime Minister Narendra Modion Saturday (November 15, 2025) accused successive Congress governments of neglecting tribal communities during their 60 years in power, despite their significant role in the country’s freedom struggle. Commenting on theBJP-led NDA’s landslide victory in Bihar, Mr. Modi said it proved that voters have rejected a caste-driven political narrative, noting that the NDA had swept almost all seats with a large Dalit electorate. Speaking at a public gathering at Dediapada in Gujarat’s Narmada district on the 150th birth anniversary of tribal icon Dharti Aaba Bhagwan Birsa Munda, the PM said the BJP-led government has expanded medical services in tribal regions, particularly for sickle cell disease which disproportionately affects tribal populations. “A nationwide campaign is underway to address sickle cell disease, and under this initiative, six crore tribal brothers and sisters across the country have already been screened,” he said. During a day-long visit to Gujarat, the PM also inaugurated and laid the foundation stones of various infrastructure and development projects, cumulatively worth more than ₹9,700 crore. Mr. Modi said the tribal community had played a significant role in the country’s freedom struggle, but their contribution was not adequately recognised after Independence. “The contribution of tribal freedom fighters was overlooked so that credit could be attributed to a few families,” he said. He highlighted the work done by Gujarat tribal leaders such as Govind Guru, Raja Roopsingh Nayak, Motilal Tejawat, and Dashriben Chaudhary, adding that “numerous chapters of the freedom struggle are adorned with tribal pride and valour.” Prime Minister Narendra Modi pays floral tribute to the freedom fighter Bhagwan Birsa Munda on his 150th birth anniversary at Dediapada, in Narmada, on November 15, 2025.

The transfer is part of the ₹18,000 crore disbursed to more than nine crore farmers across the country. The Prime Minister’s address was streamed live across Gujarat, including at a State-level event in Gandhinagar where Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel and Agriculture Minister Jitu Vaghani distributed approval letters for agricultural assistance schemes worth over ₹11.68 lakh. Mr. Patel said the “double-engine government” had swiftly announced a ₹10,000-crore relief package to help farmers recover from losses caused by recent unseasonal and intense rainfall. He said that improved irrigation and near-universal daytime power supply, now reaching more than 98% of farmers, had transformed the State’s agricultural sector. Speaking about the Centre’s focus on environmental sustainability, Mr. Patel said the Prime Minister had consistently promoted increased green cover and encouraged natural farming. Chemical-heavy practices, he warned, were harming soil health and human well-being. “Natural farming is the agriculture of the future,” he said, calling for widespread adoption to secure long-term soil fertility and healthier crops. He also pointed to the Krishi Mahotsav, launched in Gujarat in 2005 during Mr. Modi’s tenure as Chief Minister, as a key initiative that brought scientific guidance directly to farmers’ fields and strengthened the “lab to land” model. Agriculture Minister Mr. Vaghani said nearly three lakh farmers in Gujarat joined the live telecast through Krishi Vigyan Kendras, gram panchayats, APMCs and other centres.

According to police, Dinesh Raval from Sudasana village fell ill at home late Thursday (November 27, 2025) night. “He was taken to the government hospital in Vadnagar, where he was declared dead. The post-mortem has confirmed cardiac arrest as the cause,” said Sub-Inspector Udaysinh Zala of Satlasana police station. He added that neither Mr. Raval’s family nor colleagues had made any complaint regarding working conditions. While the police maintained there was no indication of external pressure, Opposition parties and teacher organisations claimed that BLO duties for the SIR exercise caused severe strain on teaching staff. Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi said that with inadequate support, BLOs were struggling to meet deadlines. Gujarat State Primary Teachers Association president Digvijaysinh Jadeja urged the government to review the practice of assigning BLO duties to teachers. “Many teachers are juggling school responsibilities and BLO work simultaneously. Some even work late into night to complete the revisions,” he said. Mr. Raval’s death comes against the backdrop of two similar incidents reported earlier this month. On November 20, a teacher in Kheda district working as a BLO died of a heart attack, and his family blamed the workload. A day later,another teacher posted as BLO in Gir Somnath district ended his life; his family alleged he had been under intense mental stress due to SIR-related tasks.

642,2025,The Hindu,642,"Sea levels around Indian coastlines projected to rise up to 1 metre by 2100: INCOIS study The Relative Mean Sea Level (RMSL) around coastal India is projected to rise by 0.5–1 metre by the end of this century and this is likely to be the main contributor toextreme sea-level rise along Indian coastlines, according to scientists at the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS). Findings from their study suggest that climate change-induced hazards such as storm surges, waves, and tides may significantly contribute to end-of-century Extreme Sea Level (ESL) at specific locations along India’s coast. The coastal zones of the Gulf region in Gujarat are expected to be largely affected by changes in tidal amplitude, while changes in climate extremes could become a major source of ESL variation at Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh. “Our findings are based solely on various available global model simulations. They highlight multiple sources of uncertainty and the potential way forward to reduce those uncertainties,” said INCOIS Director T.M. Balakrishnan Nair in an exclusive interaction. The rise in ESL poses a significant risk for India, given its extensive coastline of over 11,098.81 km, including the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep Islands. Several low-lying areas lie within five metres of mean sea level, such as the deltaic regions in the northern Bay of Bengal, parts of Lakshadweep Islands, and expansive inter-tidal zones in Gujarat. An interim report titled 'Projected Climate Change-Induced Extreme Sea Levels and Coastal Vulnerability along the Indian Coasts', prepared under the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ (MoES) ""Deep Ocean Mission”, warns that rising sea levels could lead to beach retreat and erosion, permanent flooding of coastal areas, and loss of marine biodiversity.

A year earlier, Mr. Garman had laid out a practical, infrastructure-first roadmap for bringing generative AI into enterprise production. In that keynote—his first as AWS’s chief—he emphasised investments in custom chips, expanded instance families, and tightened integration between model-building tools, like SageMaker, and model-consumption platforms, like Bedrock, as companies sought to move from experiments to sustained, cost-efficient production. At re:Invent 2025, Mr. Garman echoed that infrastructure-first thesis and sharpened it around “agentic” capabilities. He showed how a combination of custom silicon, new foundation models, managed model-training platforms, and orchestration tooling can be composed into agents that automate multistep business workflows. The announcements this year emphasised an integrated path with Forge and other developer-facing platforms for custom model training, expanded Bedrock offerings for enterprises wanting vetted models with governance, and production-ready agent frameworks for tasks spanning code generation, security orchestration, and operational automation. Google and Microsoft have both staked large, visible claims on agentic AI, but they play different hands. Google pairs Gemini, its family of models and agent tooling, with deep product integration across Search and Workspace; its strengths are model innovation, multimodal reasoning, and product-level ubiquity that can surface agents inside everyday apps.

The protest soon turned violent with students torching various vehicles, including a bus and an ambulance, and vandalising properties across campus such as the chancellor’s residence, mess and laboratories. The report by the MPPURC panel has flagged multiple irregularities in the functioning of the institute and lapses on the part of the management, including adopting a “dictatorial attitude” on the campus and having a “disciplinary system based on fear”.

Mr. Singh made the remarks in a letter to his subordinates on Sunday (November 23, 2025) to congratulate them on the success of “Operation Trackdown”, a special campaign to track down criminals, being carried out for the past 18 days in the State. “Singers who promote gang lifestyles to youth through music and videos, driven by money and power, should be treated as criminals and strict legal action should be taken against them,” Mr. Singh wrote, adding that these people, in a matter of minutes, make the youth forget the teachings of their parents and teachers and the discipline of society. Praising the police force, Mr. Singh said they had foiled more than sixty murder plots during the campaign, which, he said, was a “historic achievement”. “You must dismantle their entire criminal ecosystem. Continue to take legal action against those who handle their illegal income, supply weapons, provide hiding places and create a favourable publicity on social media and among the general public,” said Mr. Singh.

A generational wind called Uchimalai Kaathu — believed to carry the scent of the Uchchaani flower, along with a deathly wail and malevolence — bursts from the mountains and into the village once in every 25 years. This wind becomes an all-encompassing allegory to the storm that many, like the titular Angammal (a fantastic Geetha Kailasam), brave through as time sifts through her fingers like sand. When we first meet her, Angammal is driving her granddaughter, Periya Nayagi aka Manju, on her moped to get her a tattoo of the Uchchaani flower, the same tattoo that her late mother had (the introduction shot is crafty camera work that entices your attention). The tattooing is interrupted by Manju’s mother, and Angammal retorts with a piece of her mind. From the word go, Vipin draws the faultlines of a fracturing reality with a voice and conviction you seldom expect from a novice filmmaker. An intricate character study builds as we learn more of this sleeveless-wearing, beedi-smoking, foul-mouthed, hair-trigger moody widow, who is grappling with the tides of time. It had begun long before we met her — like naming her granddaughter after her mother, which one can safely assume is an existential effort to wind the clock back. Angammal, we soon learn, is stricken with fears of her world — her family, her town, and her place in it — slipping away. In the gaps between her generation and the next, she fills with solitude, in the windy fields, and a companionship with another elderly widower. Geetha Kailasam in a still from ‘Angammal’

Temporary walkways — wooden planks precariously balanced on diesel barrels — connect the wall to houses, providing a passage over inundated streets below. Meenakshi, 47, her face veiled, says her family had returned to the village just a fortnight ago. They had stayed on rent in Barwala town, about 7 km away, for over two months after the flood water entered their homes in the last week of August. “Even after three months, the administration has failed to provide us safe connectivity.

Singh has stressed strict legal action against singers promoting gun culture among the youth, saying that they should be treated as “criminals”. Mr. Singh made the remarks in a letter to his subordinates on Sunday (November 23, 2025) to congratulate them on the success of “Operation Trackdown”, a special campaign to track down criminals, being carried out for the past 18 days in the State. “Singers who promote gang lifestyles to youth through music and videos, driven by money and power, should be treated as criminals and strict legal action should be taken against them,” Mr. Singh wrote, adding that these people, in a matter of minutes, make the youth forget the teachings of their parents and teachers and the discipline of society. Praising the police force, Mr. Singh said they had foiled more than sixty murder plots during the campaign, which, he said, was a “historic achievement”. “You must dismantle their entire criminal ecosystem. Continue to take legal action against those who handle their illegal income, supply weapons, provide hiding places and create a favourable publicity on social media and among the general public,” said Mr. Singh. The police have recovered more than 250 country-made pistols, revolvers and pistols and 350 live cartridges from more than 1,500 criminals, said Mr. Singh. Earlier this year, the Haryana Police had taken down about 10 songs allegedly promoting gun culture from various social media platforms, and at least two concerts, including one in Gurugram, were halted midway. Six of the 10 banned songs were sung by Masoom Sharma, a prominent Haryanvi singer. However, several artists from the music industry had accused the police of “picking and choosing” to target a few singers.

670,2025,The Hindu,670,"CCMB study reveals microbial diversity in Eastern Ghats lakes A first-of-its-kind large-scale study of bacterial communities across lakes and reservoirs in the Eastern Ghats by scientists from LaCONES, CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) in Hyderabad, has revealed striking patterns of microbial diversity. Lakes inside protected areas showed significantly higher bacterial richness, while those near industrial zones exhibited reduced diversity. The research provides a comprehensive microbial map of the Eastern Ghats, underscoring the pivotal role of bacteria in sustaining water quality, nutrient cycling, and ecosystem resilience, said LaCONES CSIR-CCMB chief scientist G. Umapathy on Monday (December 1, 2025). The Eastern Ghats, a discontinuous mountain range along India’s eastern coast, is intersected by major rivers such as Krishna, Kaveri, Mahanadi, and Godavari. Climate change is a key driver of microbial shifts, altering biogeochemical cycles in aquatic systems, yet its impact on Eastern Ghats lakes remains poorly understood, he noted. Using environmental DNA (eDNA) from 40 sites across 23 waterbodies in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Odisha, the team generated over a million DNA reads per sample to uncover hidden bacterial diversity. The study, published inGlobal Ecology and Conservation, found that each lake harboured a unique bacterial signature with minimal overlap, indicating strong spatial structuring. Smaller waterbodies (<25 sq. km) showed the highest mean bacterial richness compared to medium and large lakes. Rare bacterial species, though low in abundance, played critical roles in pollutant degradation and stress-response pathways. Salinity and turbidity emerged as key environmental drivers shaping microbial communities. Picocyanobacterium Vulcanococcus, vital for nitrogen cycling, was widespread, with Chilika Lake showing the highest abundance, followed by Nagarjunasagar, Peddadevulpally Lake, and Srisailam Dam.

Responses to multiple RTIs filed byThe Hindushow the government is yet to determine how the prohibited variety entered the open market. A Horticulture Department official said they had undertaken the “necessary steps under our ambit and power”, referring to the destruction of the crop on half an acre of land cultivated by farmer Jeevan on May 17, 2019. However, activists who were instrumental in calling attention to the issue accused the government of “adopting a casual approach towards a serious problem”. “The government’s claim that the farmer whose field was identified as growing the illegal crop was the only one to do so is absurd. Neither can the farmer develop such seed in his backyard nor can he have a privileged relationship with seed developers to be bestowed exclusive access of growing their proprietary seed,” said Rajinder Chaudhary, a former Professor in the Department of Economics with M.D. University, Rohtak. The commercial cultivation of Bt brinjal is banned in India. In May 2019, when activists flagged the issue, Haryana’s Biotechnology Coordination Committee, which monitors activities related to GM organisms, proposed destroying the crop. Following this, the crop was uprooted and buried to avoid contamination. When questioned, Mr. Jeevan, who bought the saplings of brinjal in December 2017, told the authorities that he was not aware that the saplings were of GM variety. He said the seeds were procured from a roadside vendor. In response to an RTI query on whether any probe had been conducted in the case, the Environment and Climate Change Department said it wrote to the Horticulture Department twice in 2019 — in July and August — seeking details of those against whom action needed to be initiated.

The State government is working on three fronts to combat drugs. First, spreading awareness about the dangers of drug abuse. Second, preventing youth from falling into the addiction trap by cracking down on drug mafias, strengthening law enforcement agencies, and empowering them to deal sternly with thechittamafia. Third, ensuring rehabilitation for young people trapped in addiction,” Mr. Sukhu said, adding, “Addicted youth are not criminals, they need treatment, care, and support.” The Chief Minister said the government had adopted a zero-tolerance policy againstchitta. “No one involved in this trade will be spared, no matter how influential they may be.

In this financial year, the salaries were delayed at least thrice,” Harish Sharma, Chairperson, Department of Political Science, HPU, and former president of the HPUTWA said on Wednesday (November 12, 2025). “The recurring delay has caused deep frustration and demoralisation among the university’s teaching and non-teaching staff. The postponement of salary disbursement not only disrupts their financial stability but also undermines the academic atmosphere of one of the State’s premier institutions. Teachers have been boycotting classes to press for their demand, leading to academic disruption.

679,2025,The Hindu,679,"Why does India need bioremediation? | Explained Human waste is leading to a decaying world where access to clean air, water or soil is becoming increasingly difficult. The solution is two-pronged - stop making more waste and clean up the waste already made. Bioremediation literally means “restoring life through biology.” It harnesses microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, algae and plants to sequester or transform toxic substances such as oil, pesticides, plastics, or heavy metals. These organisms metabolise these pollutants as food, breaking them down into harmless by-products such as water, carbon dioxide, or organic acids. In some cases, they can convert toxic metals into less dangerous forms that no longer leach into the soil or groundwater. There are two broad types: In situ bioremediation,where treatment happens directly at the contaminated site — think oil-eating bacteria sprayed on an ocean spill. Ex situ bioremediation,where contaminated soil or water is removed, treated in a controlled facility, and returned once cleaned. Modern bioremediation combines traditional microbiology with cutting-edge biotechnology. First, new biotechnologies are enabling humans to gain unprecedented insight into biology, allowing them to identify biomolecules with useful characteristics. Second, these technologies allow humans to replicate these biomolecules under desired conditions of use, such as sewage plants or agricultural lands. For example, genetically modified (GM) microbes are designed to degrade tough chemicals like plastics or oil residues that natural species struggle with. Synthetic biology also allows for “biosensing”,  organisms that change colour or fluorescence when they detect toxins, providing early warnings of contamination.

Although pollution has been reducing, rivers such as the Ganga and Yamuna receive untreated sewage and industrial effluents daily.

Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu, who held a meeting with Union Minister of State for Science and Technology and Earth Sciences Dr. Jitendra Singh in New Delhi on Tuesday (October 28, 2025) evening, requested the government to provide one Doppler weather radar and 150 automatic weather stations in adequate numbers to ensure early and quick warning related to natural disasters in the State. “Due to the geological positioning of Himachal Pradesh and concerning issues of global warming and climate change, the State has witnessed an alarming rise in the occurrences of natural disasters. The State was suffering huge losses due to these disaster instances,” said Mr. Sukhu, according to an official statement. He said weather-related data should be integrated with the Central recognised national early warning agencies so that the State could receive accurate and timely alerts pertaining to adverse weather conditions. The Chief Minister also requested officials for setting up a seismic laboratory and data analysis centre in Kangra-Hamirpur zone, as these areas fall within Seismic Zone 5 and are prone to earthquakes. “A modern warning and data monitoring and analysis system should be set up in Himachal [Pradesh] due to an increase in natural disasters in the State over the last few years,” he said.

(2025), ‘Edges of the Nation: Party System Divergence and Political Representation in Mountain India’,Studies in Indian Politics. doi.org/10.1177/23210230251374814 When studying the political history of a country, how much does its geography come into play? India hosts mountains, valleys with river systems, deserts, and islands; ascribing the same analytical lenses to this variety might not always be productive. Research and political work in India tends to overlook the differences brought out by geography, as most such conclusions rely on electoral data taken from India’s densely populated plains. This need for variety in analysis is expanded upon in Devesh Marwah’s and Aniket Alam’s research paper titled, ‘Edges of the Nation: Party System Divergence and Political Representation in Mountain India’. The authors focus on mountain societies and differentiate their political realities from the plains using electoral data. Rather than looking at mountain societies through the perspective of lowland, State-governed societies, they are categorised as ‘Zomia’. The term is used to describe highland regions in Southeast Asia whose communities can not be ascribed the same social science concepts as societies in the plains. The geographical term, Zomia, was coined in 2002 by Willem van Schendel, who hypothesised that the lack of perspective on such regions marginalised its peoples and obscured their histories and political dynamics. Anthropologist James C. Scott expanded upon the concept by arguing that such areas were kept ‘stateless’ as a means of resistance. Mountain states wanted to evade the ways of the lowland “paddy states,” which meant wet rice cultivation, taxation, and bureaucratic control. Many academic and political perspectives see the mountain state as backward and developmentally stunted, but fail to recognise the structural difference between them and lowland states. However, Scott, along with many other academics, agree that with the ad",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/on-the-mountain-state-vote-reading-political-landscapes-through-geography/article70345524.ece

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke after meeting with France's President on Monday (December 1, 2025), the latest in discussions aimed at brokering the terms for a potential ceasefire in the largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II. Meanwhile, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed that Russian President Vladimir Putin would meet with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff on Tuesday. Witkoff's role came under scrutiny last week following a report that he coached Putin's foreign affairs adviser on how Russia's leader should pitch to Trump on the Ukraine peace plan. Mr. Zelenskyy's visit to Paris followed Sunday's meeting between Ukrainian and U.S. officials, which Secretary of State Marco Rubio described as productive. The two sides have worked to revise the proposed US-authored plan that was developed in negotiations between Washington and Moscow but criticised as being too weighted toward Russian demands. The Kremlin late Monday boasted of Russia's battlefield gains ahead of the talks, claiming Moscow's troops have captured the key city of Pokrovsk in the eastern Donetsk region. According to Mr. Peskov, Mr. Putin received a report about Pokrovsk's capture on Sunday. Mr. Zelenskyy, however, said in Paris that fighting was still ongoing in Pokrovsk on Monday. Mr. Zelenskyy called the topic of Ukraine's control over its territories ""the most complicated"" in discussions over the plan.

Joaquin Guzman Lopez had been scheduled to appear in federal court in Chicago for a status hearing, but instead entered a guilty plea, court records showed. Guzman Lopez is one of four sons of El Chapo - known as Los Chapitos, or Little Chapos - who inherited their father’s faction of the Sinaloa cartel. Guzman Lopez originally pleaded not guilty after his arrest last year in Texas. Jeffrey Lichtman, Guzman Lopez’s defense lawyer, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Guzman Lopez faced multiple charges in the U.S. of funneling huge quantities of fentanyl and other drugs to U.S. streets. Fentanyl overdoses have surged to become the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 18 and 45. Guzman Lopez was detained in July 2024 after landing in a private plane in the El Paso area. He was arrested along with Mexican drug kingpin Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, one of the most consequential traffickers in Mexico’s history, who co-founded the Sinaloa Cartel with El Chapo. Current and former U.S. officials, who sought anonymity to speak candidly about the events, told Reuters at the time that Guzman Lopez had lured Zambada to the U.S., a major coup for U.S. authorities. Ovidio Guzman Lopez, another son of “El Chapo,” pleaded guilty in July to two counts of drug distribution and two counts of participation in a continuing criminal enterprise.

The matter will now be placed before the Chief Justice for appropriate orders. The petition was filed by Pritam Dinkar Adhav, a Nashik-based businesswoman, challenging a March 6, 2025, notification issued by the Defence Ministry substituting her with Sachin Suresh Thakre, a businessman, as a nominated member of the Deolali Cantonment Board. Ms. Adhav contended that her tenure was fixed until February 10, 2026, under an earlier notification and that the removal violated the Cantonments Act, 2006. Senior advocate A. A. Kumbhakoni, for the petitioner, argued that the impugned notification was “ex facie illegal and without jurisdiction,” as the Act provides for removal only under Section 34, which mandates notice and adherence to principles of natural justice. “The power to vary the constitution of the Board does not include the power to substitute a member mid-term. Unless a vacancy arises or removal is affected under Section 34, nomination of another person is impermissible,” he submitted. He further contended that the doctrine of pleasure cannot be read into the Act, which prescribes a fixed tenure once notified. “The mere power to appoint does not include the power to substitute arbitrarily,” he said. Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, representing the Union of India and Defence Estates authorities, countered that the Central Government’s power to nominate under Section 13(3) includes the power to replace. “The right to nominate is absolute and unfettered. The petitioner held office at the pleasure of the Government. Section 21 of the General Clauses Act permits amendment or rescission of notifications,” he argued.

Mr. Ramzan made the remarks in his maiden speech in Rajya Sabha after taking oath as member of the Upper House along with NC leader Sajjad Ahmed Kichloo and party treasurer Gurwinder Singh Oberoi alias 'Shammi'. Mr. Oberoi is the first Sikh community member from Kashmir who has been sent to the Rajya Sabha. The three NC leaders along with BJP's Sat Sharma were elected to the Rajya Sabha last month. This was the first Rajya Sabha election in Jammu and Kashmir since its bifurcation in 2019, filling seats that had remained vacant since 2021. During his speech, amid interruptions from some members, Mr. Ramzan said people had given two-thirds majority to the NC, paving the way for a popular government led by Chief Minister Omar Abdullah.

Mr. Parra, who is a PDP Member of the Legislative Assembly from Pulwama, had challenged the earlier order that barred his travel outside J&K. “An MLA has to move out of the Union Territory time and again in connection with his official and other duties and this condition is creating a lot of hardship and inconvenience,” Shariq Reyaz, counsel for Mr. Parra, told the court.

Mr. Choudhary said his visit was “to make a statement that the government stands” with the journalist.

The JMM candidate secured 1,04,794 votes, while his nearest rival Babu Lal Soren of the BJP bagged 66,270 votes after all 20 rounds of counting, the official said. JLKM candidate Ramdas Murmu was in the third position with 11,542 votes. The Election Commission, however, was yet to update the results on its website. East Singhbhum District Election Officer (DEO)-cum-Deputy Commissioner (DC) Karn Satyarthi said the counting has been completed and Somesh Chandra Soren won the bypoll. JMM workers celebrated the victory by bursting firecrackers and smearing ‘gulaal’ on one another, stating that the win was a tribute to former chief minister, the late Shibu Soren, and ex-education minister, the late Ramdas Soren.

From being long-time neighbours, they evolved into close friends after marrying fisherfolk in the same village in the Kaliasole block in Jharkhand’s Dhanbad district, near the State’s border with West Bengal. “Where will we graze our cattle if the floating solar project goes through? The village doesn’t have enough greenery to feed so many cattle. And most importantly, where will our husbands go fishing if the dam [reservoir] is out of bounds for us? We will simply not survive,” Rita says, seated on the dam and gazing into the sun setting over the reservoir. Their anxieties around losing access to the reservoir stem from the news of upcoming solar energy projects across the Panchet Dam site. Panchet Dam is the last of the four multi-purpose dams built under the first phase of the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC). Inaugurated in 1959, the Panchet Dam was built mainly to control floods in the Damodar river, earlier known as the ‘sorrow of Bengal’ for its frequent and devastating floods since the 18th century. Jharkhand’s Dhanbad district (that was previously in Bihar) lies on the northern side of the Panchet Dam, whereas West Bengal’s Purulia district lies on its southern bank. As the women talk, Rita’s husband and other fisherfolk have become specks on the reservoir water as they cast their fishing nets from their boats. This is the livelihood of nearly 2,500 fisherfolk from Jharkhand and West Bengal. “The next morning, we revisit our nets in the reservoir, collect the fish caught overnight, and sell those in the market. On a good day, we catch enough to earn ₹500 to ₹800 in a day. On a bad day, we come back empty-handed.

727,2025,The Hindu,727,"One-atom experiment settles Einstein’s challenge in Bohr’s favourPremium In the 1920s, Albert Einstein proposed a twist on the double-slit experiment. Rather than a wall with two fixed slits, he imagined a very light slit that would recoil when a single photon passed through it. If one could measure that recoil, one could in principle tell which path the photon took. At the same time, one could also look for an interference pattern, which is a sign that light behaves like a wave. Einstein hoped this would show a conflict inside quantum theory itself. Niels Bohr however argued that the plan would fail. For almost a century, the argument stayed on paper because nobody had a way to test the idea. A new study by University of Science and Technology of China researchers has now realised a way, by replacing the movable slit with a single atom. The findings were published inPhysical Review Letterson December 2. A focused laser beam held the atom in place. The researchers cooled the atom close to its ground state, where its random motion was as small as quantum physics allowed. In this state, the uncertainty in the atom’s momentum is similar to the momentum of a single photon. The idea was to check whether the atom’s recoil could be used to say which way a photon went and how that information affected the interference pattern. In the study team’s setup, a photon scattered off the trapped atom in a way that defined two possible paths, which were then recombined to form bright and dark fringes on a detector. At the same time, the photon gave the atom a small ‘kick’ upwards or downwards, depending on the path. Thus, knowing more about the atom’s recoil told the team more about which path the photon took. By tweaking the beam’s strength, the team could tune the atom’s momentum uncertainty. When the uncertainty was large, the two recoil states overlapped and it became impossible to tell which path the photon took, yet the interference pattern was sharp. When the uncertainty was small, the recoil was distinct but the interference became less visible.

Gavai observed in the judgment. Saranda is one of the world’s most pristine sal forests, the court noted. It is home to critically endangered species, including the endemic sal forest tortoise, four-horned antelope, Asian palm civet, and wild elephants. For centuries, the area has been inhabited by the Ho, Munda, Uraon and allied Adivasi communities whose subsistence and cultural traditions are intrinsically tied to forest produce. The Saranda forest division also accounts for 26% of India’s iron ore reserves. The steel plants of SAIL and Tata are critically dependent on mining in this area. Amicus curiae, senior advocate K. Parameshwar, had submitted to the court that a judicial declaration of the entire area as a wildlife sanctuary would halt mining and affect employment opportunities. The hearings had seen the Jharkhand government dither uncertainly about the area that ought to be cordoned off from mining and declared a wildlife sanctuary. The State had initially suggested that only 24,941.64 hectares of forest area should be declared a sanctuary, arguing that “vital public infrastructure” in the area would have to be demolished to make space for the sanctuary. The State had contended that even the tribal population would be upended by the sanctuary. However, the Jharkhand government later clarified in court that the 31,468.25 hectares of forest area, consisting of 126 compartments, neither hosted mining activities nor was used for any non-forest use.

Damodara Rao and general secretary G.V. Narasaiah said before merging the APSRTC with the Transport department in 2020, retired RTC employees used to pay a certain amount under the Retired Employees Medical Scheme (REMS). Under this scheme, RTC hospitals and dispensaries provided treatment along with medicines to the beneficiaries. They said keeping the welfare of retired RTC staff in view, similar medical facilities should be continued even after the merger. They recalled that before the merger, lifetime medical benefits worth ₹4 lakh were provided to both employees and their spouses in referral hospitals, in addition to free treatment and medicines in RTC hospitals. However, after the merger, the previous government discontinued this REMS scheme, causing hardship to retired employees, they pointed out. They said following repeated appeals by them and with the efforts of Mr. Tirumala Rao, the present government issued orders in January this year, stating that the employees who retired after the merger and who pay the prescribed amount would be covered under EHS for medical benefits for both husband and wife, but only OP (outpatient) treatment would be available at RTC hospitals.

NOTA was introduced in Indiathrough the Supreme Court's judgment in September 2013. The need to introduce NOTA was felt to discourage the parties from fielding tainted candidates. The Supreme Court directed the Election Commission (EC) of India to make necessary provision in the ballot papers/EVMs so that the voters can decide not to vote for any of the candidates in the fray. Introduced in 2013, the NOTA option on electronic voting machines has its own symbol — a ballot paper with a black cross across it. After the Supreme Court order in September 2013, the Election Commission added the NOTA button on the EVMs as the last option on the voting panel. One ballot unit has 16 buttons. Before the apex court order, those not inclined to vote for any candidate had the option of filling what is popularly called form 49O. But filling out the form at the polling station under Rule 49-O of the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961, compromised the secrecy of the voter.

Ponmudy would be taken after examining Monday’s Supreme Court verdict that stayed his conviction and sentence in a corruption case, Assembly Speaker M. Appavu said on Tuesday. During an informal chat with journalists here, Mr. Appavu, after inaugurating a photo exhibition highlighting the achievements of the State government, said Mr. Ponmudy, who was convicted by the Madras High Court, had challenged the verdict in the Supreme Court and the apex court had granted interim stay on his conviction. Hence there was a chance of him getting back his MLA post, as in the case of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Lakshadweep MP Mohammed Faizal and Ghazipur MP Anzari. After getting the copy of the Supreme Court’s verdict, the matter would be discussed with the Assembly Secretary before a decision is made, Mr. Appavu said. On Governor R.N. Ravi’s continuing diatribe against Bishop Robert Caldwell and G.U. Pope, the Speaker said Minister for Defence Rajnath Singh had recently observed that the British rule had destroyed the Indian culture, which was being endorsed by a few more. Before the British could establish their empire, only the ‘upper caste’ had access to education and places of worship, the Speaker said. After Bishop Caldwell and G.U. Pope landed in India, the situation changed, he added. “Though they preached Christianity, they gave free education to every citizen irrespective of their caste and religion. This is the prime reason for Tirunelveli and Kanniyakumari districts stamping their indelible footprint in the field of education.

He alleged that the revision has been imposed without any public consultation, stakeholder engagement, or transparent justification, thereby rendering the process procedurally infirm and in violation of the principles of natural justice and fair public administration. The fare hike warranted urgent reconsideration and structured review, he said. The letter stated that the fare revision order fails to disclose any cost analysis, operational expense breakdown, or methodology that would reasonably justify the steep increase in passenger fares. “The absence of such data undermines the principle of reasoned decision-making as mandated under Article 14 of the Constitution, and renders the order non-speaking and arbitrary in nature,” it said. Mr. Sayeed said that the revised fare structure imposes an undue financial burden on categories of passengers for whom travel constitutes an essential service, especially students and patients. “Particularly egregious is the complete absence of any concessional or subsidised fare provision for students, who frequently rely on inter-island and mainland transport for educational purposes. This omission stands in stark contradiction to the principles of equity and affirmative protection enshrined under Article 15(4) and Article 21, thereby disproportionately impacting the right to education and access to essential services,” he said.",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/lakshadweep-mp-demands-rollback-of-ship-fare-hike/article69667847.ece

Chandrachud used its plenary powers to declare Kuldeep Kumar, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) candidate, as thevalidly elected Mayor of the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation. With CCTV visuals indicating that the presiding officer had defaced some ballot papers in the mayoral polls, the Supreme Court conducted a physical examination of the ballots to determine the winner. The Court observed that in such cases it is duty-bound to intervene under Article 142 of the Constitution to ensure that “democracy is not allowed to be thwarted by such subterfuges”. However, just before the Court’s verdict, three AAP councillors from Chandigarh joined the BJP. With the help of these defections, BJP candidates won the elections to the posts of deputy and senior deputy Mayor held on March 4. With the BJP now having a majority in the council and the Mayor possessing limited independent powers, the INDIA alliance has essentially lost control over the municipal corporation. The shenanigans in Chandigarh raise multiple questions regarding local democracy: the fair administration of local elections; the problem of local-level defections; and the challenge of ensuring democratic governance in Union Territories (UTs).

Listing the services being done by both all-weather vessels and high-speed craft (HSC), the island administration said, “the allegations of insufficient connectivity are baseless and with ulterior motives”. The communication from the administration said the allegation that the tickets of passengers, who did not show up in passenger reporting centre in Wellington Island, were not being distributed since April 1 was totally false and deserves strong condemnation. “At the time of booking, a waiting list is generated on first-come first-served basis for those who could not book the tickets. This is being done for every single voyage in every single ship. Subsequently, during the process of boarding, when a passenger with confirmed ticket fails to show up at the reporting centre in Willingdon Island, the list of such tickets is prepared and the tickets are allotted to passengers based on their serial number in the waiting list. This ensures that there is complete objectivity and transparency in who will get the ticket. It also eliminates any human intervention and arbitrariness in distribution of tickets,” the communication added.

767,2024,The Hindu,767,"Can ‘good sounds’ help coral islands recover from bleaching?Premium Climate change is themost serious environmental problemfacing the world today. One of the main reasons for this is the global warming caused by the extraction of coal and oil, which have been underground for millennia, and burning them for industrial and non-industrial purposes to generate energy. The effects of these activities were exacerbated by other causes of global warming, such as deforestation. Global warming has many consequences, including rising sea levels and changes in the frequency of extreme weather. Another is thedestruction of coral reefs. India’s Lakshadweep islands for instance are islands formed on such reefs. Coral reefs are built by a type of organism that, when it accumulates, forms reefs and islands. They live in large colonies. Corals have a symbiotic relationship with microscopic algae called zooxanthellae, which live in the corals’ tissues. Life becomes tough when the temperature of the water around them rises. When it does, the corals expel the zooxanthellae. An important visual symptom of these effects is that the colour of the coral reef changes, and subsequently they die off in droves. This event is calledbleaching. However, not all coral bleaching events are due to warm water. Ocean acidification – which is when the pH of the water drops as more carbon dioxide dissolves in it – is another well-known cause. More acidic water reduces the availability of calcium minerals that the corals need to build and repair their exoskeletons. In many parts of the world, coral reefs have started to die due to global warming experienced over the years. The U.S. lost half of its coral reefs in the Caribbean in one year in 2005 due to a large-scale bleaching event after warm waters around the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico expanded southward. When scientists collated satellite data of the region from the previous 20 years, they were able to confirm that the 2005 event exerted more thermal stress than those in the previous 20 years combined.

Four people died and around 90 were injured on September 24 during a protest in Leh. Street protests erupted in Leh town over the demand of Statehood and Sixth Schedule. The agitation was spearheaded by activist Sonam Wangchuk, who was arrested under the National Security Act on September 26. Meanwhile, six locals, including Congress councilor Stanzin Tsepag, were granted bail along with six others by a local court. Mr. Tsepag was accused of joining the protesters who turned violent.

It threatened a two-hour peaceful silent march and an evening blackout across the union territory of Ladakh in coming days.

Angmo to amend her petition and launch a sharper, updated attack against the Centre for detaining herhusband and climate activist Sonam Wangchukunder the national security law. Mr. Wangchuk was detained under the National Security Act (NSA), 1980 following violent protests on September 24 in Leh. He was detained on September 26 and shifted to the Jodhpur Central Jail in Rajasthan. A Bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and N.V. Anjaria allowed Ms. Angmo’s application to file additional grounds highlighting “grave and incurable lapses” committed by the Centre during Mr. Wangchuk’s continued detention, including that the activist was given the complete grounds for his detention nearly a month after depriving him of his personal liberty. The court asked Ms. Angmo to file the amended petition with additional grounds in a week, and directed the Centre and the Union Territory of Ladakh to respond within 10 days after. Ms. Angmo, represented by senior advocates Kapil Sibal, Vivek Tankha, and advocate Sarvam Ritam Khare, said the entire grounds behind his detention was shared with Mr. Wangchuk after a “flagrant delay” of 28 days despite his repeated representations to his detainers. Ms. Angmo submitted that Section 8 of the NSA required the detaining authority to share the complete reasons for detention within 10 days in order to afford the detenue the “earliest opportunity to make an effective representation against the order to the appropriate government”. “The illegal and unreasonable delay in supply of the complete grounds of detention has prevented Mr. Wangchuk from preparing any effective representation against his detention.

Every villager — whether on foot, by bicycle or by motorbike — is frisked before being allowed through. Polythene sheets have been laid out in front of the closed shops, and just a couple of hours ago, a group of 20 to 30 Bangladesh nationals had assembled at the spot just before crossing the border checkpost towards the international border. In their thirties, the couple goes to the same spot where the earlier group of Bangladeshi nationals had assembled. They claim to have entered India from Bangladesh about six years ago. “First, we went to Delhi. Then we stayed at Duttapukur near Kolkata. We used to collect old newspapers and other articles from people’s homes,” says Mr. Habiul. “We have left our minor daughter in India,” Ms. Sajda adds, saying it is heartbreaking to leave her behind. Their daughter and her husband work at a brick kiln near Barasat, and the couple must clear their debts with their employers before they are allowed to leave, she says. “We are poor and do not have proper identity documents.

Some hearings are listed as far ahead as 2030 and figures show more than a quarter of cases wait a year or longer, with many victims abandoning proceedings.

His behaviour deteriorated so sharply that a community advocate reached out to a refugee organisation for help, fearing he was becoming suicidal.

A man came up to him during the speech — where he praised the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's philosophy and vision — apparently to remind that he had to catch a flight back to Delhi at 7.30 p.m. The former V-P then informed the audience that he had a flight to catch, and added cryptically, ""I can't skip my duty for catching a flight, and friends, my recent past is proof of it."" The remark evoked peals of laughter from the audience. The book debunks propaganda which portrays the RSS as an ultra-right organisation and even seeks to link it to the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi though it is a baseless charge, Mr. Dhankhar said. Congress veteran Digvijaya Singh on Friday (Novemerb 21) took a swipe at the BJP as no leader of the ruling party received former V-P Jagdeep Dhankhar at the airport in Bhopal, claiming that it follows the “use-and-throw” policy. Reacting to the absence of BJP leaders at the airport, Mr. Singh said the saffron party considers only those people important who serve its immediate interests. “It follows ‘use and throw policy,’ he said, talking to reporters. “I can’t say this about the RSS as he has come to attend their programme,” the Rajya Sabha MP added. Mr. Singh also said he had sought an appointment, from the official accompanying the former V-P, to meet Mr. Dhankhar.",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cant-skip-duty-to-catch-flight-jagdeep-dhankhar-makes-first-speech-after-resigning-as-v-p-attends-rss-leaders-book-launch/article70310392.ece

According to the police, the incident took place on the evening of November 21 in Paanjara village under Gauharganj police station limits, when the girl was playing in a house in her neighbourhood and the accused lured her with treats. The accused has been identified as Salman, 23, a native of Sehore district. Raised Superintendent of Police (SP) Pankaj Pandey toldThe Hinduthat the accused lured the girl and took her to a nearby forest where he raped her. The accused then fled the scene while the girl returned home crying while her parents were also looking for her. The girl was taken to a government hospital in neighbouring Obaidullaganj but was immediately referred to AIIMS, Bhopal where she is undergoing treatment. “She had injuries on her body, including private parts. But she is now out of danger and has been moved out of the ICU. The doctors are still monitoring her health,” Mr. Pandey said. Meanwhile, hundreds of locals as well as members of outfits like the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and the Bajrang Dal staged a demonstration in parts of the district and blockaded the national highway, NH-45, in Mandideep between Bhopal and Raisen. The protest led to a kilometres-long traffic jam on the highway for several hours as the protestors demanded death penalty for the accused and suspension of local health officials. The locals have alleged that the government’s 108 ambulance service was not available and the child’s family had to arrange a private vehicle to take her to Bhopal.

According to the police, the accused, identified as Salman, was held from Bhopal’s Gandhinagar area late on Thursday night after a group of youths spotted him in the area and alerted the police.

In a post on social media platform X, Congress communication chief Jairam Ramesh described the developments as an “environmental tragedy and a disaster” for local Adivasi communities. “We had raised the issue of the procedural short-circuiting that Modani and Co. have committed in Dhirauli Madhya Pradesh to cut down forests for a coal mine. Reports have now emerged that large-scale tree felling has begun in the village under heavy police presence,” Mr. Ramesh said. He alleged that the local villagers have been barred from approaching the forest site and outsiders have been denied entry. Madhya Pradesh Adivasi Congress president Ramu Tekam was arrested after raising objections, Mr. Ramesh further alleged. “This is an environmental tragedy and economic disaster for the local Adivasi tribes who are reliant on the forests for their livelihood,” the former Environment Minister said. Mr. Ramesh pointed to his earlier allegations from September, where he claimed that trees were being cut on government and forest land in “blatant violation” of the Forest Rights Act.

The RSS-affiliated organisation on Monday (December 1, 2025) said that it is concerned about the lack of attention to the interests of villages and farmers affected by the acquisition of agricultural land across the country in the name of development. In a 15-point memorandum of suggestions to be given to the Central Government, the BKS mentioned about a release issued by the Indian Agro-Economic Research Center, which stated that theBritish land acquisition law of 1894continued for  many decades and even when thenew land acquisition law came into effect in 2013, the same was weakened by arbitrary amendments by the State Governments. The BKS also cited findings of the Indian Agro-Economic Research Centre that pointed to ‘no or meagre compensation’ to farmers even after the government took possession of their land, as well as poor planning for their employment and rehabilitation.

Addressing a press conference at the party headquarters, Adivasi Congress chairman Vikrant Bhuria demanded that the judicial exams be withdrawn and a high-level probe be launched into why a single tribal candidate was not selected despite constitutionally mandated quotas. Mr. Bhuria alleged that the BJP government was systematically undermining tribal rights as the community was losing land, legal protections, and even political representation. “The BJP government is orchestrating the Great Indian Tribal Crisis across the country. Under BJP rule, tribal communities are being devastated. Tribal people are not receiving justice and are struggling even to preserve their identity. The lands of tribal communities are being seized,” he alleged. “We are saying this because in the results of the 2022 Civil Judge exam in Madhya Pradesh, despite reservations, the selection of tribal candidates is zero,” Mr. Bhuria added. He pointed out that Madhya Pradesh, home to nearly two crore tribal citizens, had reserved 121 seats for Scheduled Tribe candidates in the 2022 Civil Judge exam. Yet none were selected. He said this was not an isolated case but part of a pattern, noting that no tribal candidate had been appointed since 2021. If vacancies continue for years, he warned, they risk being shifted to the general category, “a systematic way to end reservation”. Speaking on the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, the Congress leader also demanded a national migrant policy for tribal communities, arguing that seasonal migration leaves them vulnerable to exclusion. He criticised the government’s “hasty” SIR, saying it took place when many tribal families were away for work. “This is a conspiracy to systematically exclude tribals from the vot",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/madhya-pradesh/congress-alleges-bjp-bid-to-weaken-tribal-reservation-over-madhya-pradesh-civil-judge-exam/article70308230.ece

As per the notice issued by the General Administration Department on Wednesday, the government said the remarks made by Mr. Verma, who was recently appointed State president of the M.P. Anusuchit Jati and Janjati Adhikari Evam Karmachari Sangh (AJJAKS), prima facie amounted to “harming social harmony and creating animosity in the society” and fell under the category of “indiscipline and serious misconduct”. “Thus, by violating Rule 3(1), 3(2)(b) (i)(ii) of the All India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968, you have rendered yourself liable for disciplinary proceedings under the All India Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1969,” the notice read, asking him to respond within seven days why disciplinary action should not be taken against him. Addressing a regional summit of the AJJAKS on November 23, Mr. Verma had said, “One person in one family should get reservation until a Brahmin gives away his daughter to my son, or (she) has a relationship with him, if it’s only about the economic condition.” Mr. Verma is currently posted as a Deputy Secretary in the Agriculture Department. His remarks led to protests from the Brahmin community in various parts of the State, including Bhopal, Gwalior, Singrauli, Narmadapuram and Raisen, where Brahmin outfits gave complaints at police stations demanding an FIR against him. The protesters have also termed his statement “anti-women”. Leaders from both the ruling BJP and opposition Congress have also sought action against him.

Government The family members of a 58-year-old tribal woman on Thursday (November 27, 2025) alleged that she died after standing in a queue for two consecutive days to obtain fertiliser from a distribution centre in Madhya Pradesh's Guna district. The incident occurred late on Wednesday (November 26, 2025) at the Bagri fertiliser distribution centre, and the woman was identified as Bhuriya Bai from Kushepur village. Following her death, a BJP MLA questioned his party-led government in the State over the fertiliser distribution system. The woman's family members said she had been standing in a queue at the warehouse for two consecutive days to get fertiliser, even staying there overnight after spending an entire day in line. She began vomiting and was rushed to a hospital where doctors declared her dead, a family member said. Talking to reporters, Guna’s Collector Kishore Kumar Kanyal said that as per the initial information, the woman suffered from diabetes. ""Her condition deteriorated suddenly while she was standing in the queue for a long time, after which she died,"" Collector Kanyal said. Collector Kanyal visited Kushepur village with former minister Mahendra Singh Sisodia and met the woman's family. Guna MP and Union Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia expressed grief over the woman's death and directed officials to provide immediate assistance to the family, while Guna BJP MLA Pannalal Shakya raised questions over the fertiliser distribution system and criticised the collector. Addressing a programme for laying the foundation stones of two railway overbridges worth ₹52 crore in Scindia's parliamentary constituency, Shakya asked the collector why long queues are taking place for fertiliser.

Mr. Raut pointed out that Delhi and Mr. Shah will “gut” the Shinde-led Sena, and that the foundation is already being laid. “To take out Shinde, they will conduct a similar operation as they did with the undivided Shiv Sena. The BJP appointed Ravindra Chavan from Dombivli, the state president, for the same reason. He knows politics. The BJP has a record of backstabbing; they did it with Bal Thackeray.” Amid the tensions between the two allies of Mahayuti — the BJP and Shiv Sena — over the upcoming local body elections, Mr. Chavan stated that he needs to sustain the alliance until December 2. This created a political storm in the state and raised speculations that the alliance between the BJP and Shiv Sena would collapse. Mr. Raut, who had been absent from the public sphere for a month due to his health concerns, addressed the media and criticised the BJP for destroying the culture and fabric of Maharashtra’s elections, making them money-oriented. “In the last five years, under the leadership of Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, crores of rupees have been spent on elections, which has disrupted the culture of elections. The State CM and the government never got involved at the grassroots level of elections. The party functionaries fought at their own levels,” he said. Emphasising the flood of money spent in the elections, Mr. Raut alleged that at least five or six helicopters have been used in the Nagar Palika and Nagar Panchayat elections. For the constituency, he claimed that a budget of at least ₹15-20 crore has been allocated. He further asserted that one vote is sold for ₹10,000-15,000.

The first phase of local body elections were scheduled on Tuesday, December 2 for 246 municipal councils and 42 nagar panchayats.

Sitting at the footsteps of Kailasa temple, the world’s largest monolithic rock excavation, Mr. Dalrymple wondered if people knew of the international significance of the Ellora campus, renowned for its Hindu, Buddhist and Jain structures. “But the same campus has an unbroken history of veneration dating before the Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain tradition. Starting from Naga veneration, up until the Sufi tradition which is as old as Islam in India,” the popular author and historian said, recounting his walk from the top of the hill of the Ellora caves, from the Khultabad side. He rued that apart from the Ellora caves themselves, the other structures within the complex are lying in utter neglect, with many not having even a walkway to ease access or a signboard to signal their significance. He himself had taken a chance and walked over the hill, he recalled. “It is just a 10-minute walk from the top of the hill to the Ellora caves, and it is all in the same campus,” he stressed.

The launch comes as Maharashtra heads for municipal polls after a three-year delay, during which local bodies functioned without elected representatives, weakening accountability at the level closest to citizens. Maharashtra local body polls first phase: 7.94% voting recorded in first two hours “Three years of delay in holding local elections have meant that crucial decisions affecting people’s daily lives were taken without their participation.

The proposed Sadhu Gram is planned over roughly 1,000 to 1,200 acres in Nashik’s Tapovan area, and about 1,800 trees have been marked for removal, according to municipal notices. Environmental groups and residents claim some of these trees are over a century old.

826,2025,The Hindu,826,"Experts attribute spike in AQI in Mumbai to construction activities, vehicular pollution Experts have attributed the spike in the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Mumbai and its satellite cities to increase in the construction activities fuelled by various infrastructure projects as well as vehicular pollution. On Sunday (November 30, 2025), the average AQI of Mumbai was 104, which fell in the 'moderate' category. However, the AQI in some parts like the Bandra Kurla Complex was in the 'severe' range. There are six AQI categories, which are good (0-50), satisfactory (51-100), moderately polluted (101-200), poor (201-300), very poor (301-400), and severe (401-500). Angshuman Modak, climate scientist with the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, attributed the spike in the AQI level to construction activities and vehicular emission as the main source of pollution. Mumbai and its satellite cities are witnessing an urban transformation --- from multiple Metro rail lines to road works, bridges and other building activities. Slums, chawls, the last of the mills and industrial units are giving way to skyscrapers. Sushma Nair, scientist with India Meteorological Department (IMD), Mumbai, also attributed the worsening AQI Index to the infrastructure work in the city. Mr. Nair said temperature inversion and north-easterly winds are a characteristic of this time of the season when there is transition to winter. Conditions become favourable for temperature inversion when clearer skies allow the ground to cool rapidly and wind speeds are low. So a layer of cold air gets trapped below warm air. Cold air being dense subsides which does not allow the pollutants to disburse. However, for a metropolis like Mumbai, dense and tall urban structures can interfere with the air flow that can aid in dispersing the pollution, Ms. Nair explained.

The statement came after a section of media, on Monday (November 17, 2025) reported that all the 10 Kuki-Zo MLAs have decided to join a popular government in place of the existing President's rule.

Biren Singh inciting ethnic conflict – are “modified, edited, and tampered”. The Kuki Organisation for Human Rights Trust (KOHRT) told the top court that the Manipur police sent incomplete, “cut-out clips” to the NFSU instead of the complete recording. The rights organisation sought a court-monitored special investigation team (SIT) to probe the matter. Hearing the matter earlier this month, a Bench of the apex court had taken note of the NFSU’s findings. It then directed that the report be submitted to the petitioner and granted two weeks’ time to submit an affidavit in response. In the affidavit, KOHRT chairman H.S. Mate stated that after the court directed that the clips in question be sent to the NFSU, the forwarding agency – the Office of the Superintendent of Police, Cyber Crime, Manipur – “transmitted only four short, cut-out clips” that put together ran for just a little less than five minutes “instead of the complete 48-minute 46-second recording”. “Consequently, the NFSU could not verify the continuity or authenticity of the original recording and even the Central Forensic Science Laboratory was unable to examine the same for the very same reason,” Mr. Mate stated in the affidavit. Mr. Mate explained given that they had submitted the full audio recording and did not know what the forwarding agency was sending to the forensic lab in Gandhinagar, they “genuinely believed” that the full recording had been sent to the lab for examination. “It was, therefore, shocking to discover later that the audio clips actually transmitted were incorrect, incomplete, and did not represent the original recording,” he submitted.

Forest Department officials and veterinarians were surprised to find that the tusker weighed 6.5 tonnes after the capture. “This elephant (Rolex) was an extremely different type of elephant as it weighed 6.5 tonnes. This weight is hardly found in Asian elephants in the wild. This range of weight is found in African elephants and not in Asian elephants.

According to him, the animal had underlying conditions that affected its heart. “The committee is yet to submit the report. As per the initial findings, the elephant died due to cardiomyopathy,” he said. The elephant, aged 50 or above as per the molar progression, had lived in stressful situations for several years as it was used to regular crop-raiding and the counter drives by field staff. Mr. Dogra said all samples collected from the carcass were sent to multiple laboratories for histopathological examinations.

The TIM said the present NDA government must rectify the blunder by the first BJP-led NDA government more than two decades ago, “to ensure fairness, national security, and the integrity of Manipur.” The organisation had earlier said foreigners, specifically those who cross over from Myanmar, have been using the “redundant” AKT category to be considered Scheduled Tribes in India. “A legislative action is needed in Parliament to delete the AKT category, introduced by the NDA government in 2003, from the Scheduled Tribe’s list of Manipur,” TIM’s joint general secretary, Manggou Thadou, said on Friday after members of the organisation submitted a memorandum to senior Bharatiya Janata Party leaders B.L.

In a statement on Monday (December 1, 2025), the Manipur government said the move to set up the panels reflected its commitment to ensuring a coordinated, responsive, and people-centric approach to restoring stability and supporting affected families. “The State-Level Committee, chaired by the Chief Secretary and comprising the Commissioners of Finance, Home, and Rural Development and Panchayati Raj, with the Special or Additional Secretary (Home) serving as the Convenor, will provide strategic oversight and policy direction,” the statement read. The panel has also been tasked with addressing systemic issues that may affect the overall progress of rehabilitation efforts across the State.

The KZC, a coalition of Kuki-Zo civil society organisations set up in the shadow of theongoing ethnic disturbance in the State,cited a letter dated November 24 this year from the Home Department of the Manipur Government. As per this letter, the Home Department had asked authorities in the Land Resources and Tribal Affairs and Hill areas departments to take up this issue at the “earliest”, based on a representation from theManipur Meetei Tribes Union (MMTU) The representation from the MMTU called for the implementation of the Manipur Hill Areas (Acquisition of Chiefs’ Rights) Act, 1967. This law took away the traditional land ownership of Scheduled Tribe chiefs in the hill areas of the State and stopped the hereditary transfer of land ownership from one chief to the other. While the law received Presidential Assent in the same year, it was never operationalised. The KZC said, “The very notion that a non-tribal organisation is proposing fundamental changes to tribal land governance highlights deep disregard for tribal rights.” The Council said that this was coming when Manipur was still in a “state of conflict and displacement” and that such a “destabilising” move was “deliberate” and “risks further escalation”. “We urge the Hon’ble Governor of Manipur to intervene urgently and ensure that this matter is not taken forward under present circumstances,” the KZC said in their statement.

Mr. Starmer's Labour government has made improved relations with China one of its foreign policy priorities, but relations between the two countries have been strained by British accusations of spying by Beijing. In one of his clearest attempts to explain his approach to China, Mr. Starmer said in a speech to business leaders on Monday (December 1, 2025) evening that Britain's relationship with China had for too long ""blown hot and cold"". Britain has zig-zagged in its approach towards China in the past decade, moving from saying it wanted to be China's greatest supporter in Europe in the so-called ""golden era"" of relations to then being one of its fiercest critics. ""It's time for a serious approach, to reject the simplistic binary choice, neither golden age nor ice age, and recognise the plain fact that you can work and trade with a country while still protecting yourself,"" Mr. Starmer said. Mr. Starmer's decision to publicly say China posed ""national security threats"" comes after prosecutors said a trial of men accused of spying for Beijing collapsed in September because the government declined to describe the country in similar terms. In a statement on Tuesday (December 2, 2025), the Chinese embassy in London criticised what it called Mr. Starmer's ""groundless accusations"" about the threat posed by Beijing. Mr. Starmer accused Britain's previous Conservative government of overseeing a deteriorating relationship with China, which he called a ""dereliction of duty"". He said that since 2018 French President Emmanuel Macron had visited China twice and German leaders had visited China four times.

According to the Ministry of Defence, the test was conducted at the Rail Track Rocket Sled facility of the Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory in Chandigarh. The test validated canopy severance, ejection sequencing and complete aircrew recovery. The trial was undertaken in collaboration with the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), marking a major advancement in India’s in house capability to evaluate and certify escape systems. With this achievement, India joins a group of nations possessing advanced dynamic ejection testing infrastructure. DRDO noted that dynamic ejection tests are considerably more complex than static trials such as net tests or zero zero tests, and offer a realistic measure of ejection seat performance and canopy severance reliability. In the test, a dual sled system fitted with the Light Combat Aircraft forebody was propelled to a precisely controlled velocity through phased firing of multiple solid propellant rocket motors, it added. The canopy fragilisation pattern, ejection sequencing and aircrew recovery process were validated using an instrumented anthropomorphic test dummy, which captured critical pilot level parameters including loads, moments and accelerations. The entire sequence was documented through onboard and ground based imaging systems. Senior officials from the Indian Air Force and the Institute of Aerospace Medicine witnessed the test. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh congratulated DRDO, IAF, ADA, HAL and the industry partners for the milestone, calling it a major step towards strengthening India’s indigenous defence capabilities and advancing self reliance.

It added that the action taken reports submitted earlier were “incomplete, misleading, and legally insufficient”, relying on what it called “selective data”.

It has also approached the Supreme Court with voice recordings, claiming that they proved erstwhile Chief Minister N. Biren Singh’s alleged complicity in fanning the ethnic conflict. Asking the NHRC to reject the reports, the KOHRT asked the commission to issue a public censure over the reports in 15 days. The civil society organisation once again requested the commission to order an independent judicial inquiry into alleged State complicity in the violence.

During a round-table with select media personnel in Shillong last month, held in connection with World Tourism Day celebrations, Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma said that work worth over ₹500 crore, including a 550-metre runway extension and terminal upgrades, will commence in October and is expected to be completed within 15 months. The domestic airport at Umroi, located approximately 30 km from Shillong, currently offers direct connectivity to a few select cities: Kolkata, Aizawl, Imphal, and Delhi. Other air travellers heading to Meghalaya must disembark at Guwahati International Airport and undertake a three-hour road journey to reach Shillong. “There was a report by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) 15 years ago.

It was a risk to invest in the study, but it proved worthwhile. “The new report confirmed that extending the runway was now feasible. We received clearance about two years ago. Following consultations with the Union Government and AAI, we were given the go-ahead, and the Union Government subsequently sanctioned the funds.

Vivek Syiem, the Superintendent of Police of the East Khasi Hills district, said the charge sheet filed in the Sohra Subdivision Court is againstSonam Raghuvanshi, the wife of the deceased, her alleged lover Raj Kushwaha and three hitmen – Akash Singh Rajput, Vishal Singh Chauhan, and Anand Kurmi. He said a supplementary charge sheet will be filed against Lokendra Tomar, Ball Ahirwar, and Silome James, who were arrested from three places in Madhya Pradesh for allegedly destroying evidence. Sonam and Raj, the two prime accused in the murder, have been booked under three sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023. “The probe, backed by strong material evidence, revealed that Sonam was in a relationship with Raj. She conspired with him and the three hitmen to murder her husband during their honeymoon trip to Sohra,” Mr Syiem said. “The three assailants carried out the murder in the presence of Sonam,” he said. Raja and Sonam had reached Shillong on May 21 for their honeymoon, five days before they were reported missing from a homestay in Sohra. The former’s body was found in a deep gorge near the Weisawdong Falls on June 2, after an extensive search by multiple agencies, trekking groups, and locals. A Special Investigation Team formed by the State police cracked the case within a week and arrested the accused from Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. Meanwhile, the Sohra Civil Subdivision authorities lifted all restrictions at Weisawdong Falls, paving the way for the resumption of tourism activities in the area.

B. Sethukarai, branch secretary, DREU, said the workers in ‘keyman’ role played the most vital and foundational role in railway safety and they were often called the ‘eyes and ears’ on the ground. They were the last line of defence against track defects and accidents. Other duties ranged from examining loose or missing fastenings, welding fractured rails, noticing abnormal track geometry and ensuring condition of rail joints and minor bridge structures. “But, instead of deploying the keymen in their designated roles, they are sent for trivial works like painting, cleaning and other chores,” he added. Diverting their skills, instead of training them for their roles, would mean making the entire workforce inefficient. Also, blacksmiths were employed on a contract basis. “These works, which form the basis of the safety of the entire railway system, are being compromised by taking workers on contract,” he said. At times of emergency or accidents, the contract workers could not be held accountable, and this would collapse the entire railway system.

The incident occurred around 9:30 p.m. on October 30 in Sohra's Khliehshnong area, when the house of one Ham Shangpliang was surrounded by an angry crowd that allegedly threatened to burn it down, placing the occupants in grave danger, a police statement said. Upon receiving information, police teams along with magistrates from Sohra went to the spot and took measures to protect the residents. Preliminary inquiry said the violence stemmed from claims made by a boy, who alleged that he had ""visions"" of Shangpliang and believed himself to be under a witchcraft spell(ai ksuid)cast by him. The unverified claim reportedly sparked fear and mob mobilisation among locals, culminating in the attack. Due to the aggression and size of the mob, police initially faced strong resistance in dispersing the crowd. ""To ensure the safety of those inside and create a safe corridor for evacuation, tear gas and stun grenades had to be used,"" SP Vivek Syiem toldPTI. Reinforcements, including personnel from the Special Operations Team (SOT) in Shillong, were later deployed to stabilise the situation. Through coordinated efforts, the family of Shangpliang and two other families who had gathered at the residence for a death anniversary memorial service were safely evacuated. In total, 22 people, including minors, were rescued and later taken to Shillong Civil Hospital for medical examination. At least eight police personnel sustained injuries during the operation. Following identification of the key instigators, nine persons were arrested on Friday, and a case has been registered at Sohra police station.

Sangma has requested the Centre to name a road in New Delhi after his father, the late Purno Agitok Sangma, as a tribute to “one of India’s tallest leaders and statesmen”. The Chief Minister placed the request during his meeting with Home Minister Amit Shah in New Delhi on Friday (September 5, 2025). The senior Sangma, who switched from Congress to other parties before forming the National People’s Party, was the Speaker of the Lok Sabha from 1996 to 1998. He was also a Union Minister and the Chief Minister of Meghalaya. Taking to the social media site X, Mr Sangma indicated the Centre could weigh the possibility of naming a road in the national capital after his father. On May 1, the Centre named a road in New Delhi after Upendranath Brahma, a legendary Bodo leader, on his 35th death anniversary. Mr. Sangma also listed a few Meghalaya-related issues discussed with Mr Shah. They included the creation of a separate IAS and IPS cadre for Meghalaya (currently, a joint cadre with Assam) to ensure better administrative autonomy, the inclusion of Khasi and Garo languages in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India, and the implementation of the inner-line permit (ILP) in Meghalaya to safeguard the interests and identities of the indigenous communities.

874,2025,The Hindu,874,"Night curfew imposed along Bangladesh border in Meghalaya district The authorities in Meghalaya’s East Khasi Hills district have imposed a night curfew within a kilometre of the India-Bangladesh border to check illegal activities and stop infiltration. The order, issued on Thursday (August 21, 2025) under Section 163 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, restricts the movement of people in the designated zone from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. Initially, the imposition  will be for two months. The restriction bars individuals from attempting to enter Indian territory or cross into Bangladesh illegally. It also bans the assembly of five or more people, carrying of weapons or objects that can be used as weapons, and smuggling activities. Officials stated that cattle, betel nut, betel leaves, dry fish, bidis, cigarettes, tea leaves, and contraband goods were frequently smuggled across the border. They also said the ongoing situation in Bangladesh was one of the reasons behind the decision. Meghalaya and Bangladesh share a 444 km-long border, about 20% of which is unfenced due to various reasons. One of these reasons is the opposition from villagers whose houses and farmlands would be fenced out because of an international rule that disallows the construction of defence structures within 150 metres from the zero-line separating two countries. The night curfew decision follows the visit of a three-member panel to border areas affected by the intrusion of armed Bangladeshi miscreants on August 8. These intruders had tried to loot some shops and abduct a villager, reportedly for ransom. The villagers later caught and thrashed six miscreants. One of them  died of his injuries at a local hospital later. An identity card recovered from one of the intruders indicated he was a member of the Bangladesh police force. “Outposts of the Border Security Force exist, but several stretches of the border remain unguarded due to hilly terrain and the lack of fencing, which the intruders exploit,” MLA Marthon J.

The chain of events began on September 14 when the body of a four-year-old girl was found face down in a pool of water in the Nongrah area of Shillong, the State’s capital. Shock turned into outrage a few days later after the police detained a 13-year-old boy in connection with the girl’s death. The boy had allegedly cooked up a story about the girl’s disappearance, but told the police later that the girl drowned when both of them slipped and fell into the stagnant pool of water. The police are, however, probing the possibility of the girl having been killed elsewhere and dumped in the pool. On October 9, a seven-year-old boy was found dead under mysterious circumstances in the same area of Shillong. In less than 24 hours, the body of a 13-year-old girl was recovered near a village in the Ri-Bhoi district. A day later, the district police arrested a 22-year-old man on charges of raping and murdering the girl. “We shall file a charge sheet in this case after completing the legal formalities,” the district’s Senior Superintendent of Police, Vivekanand Singh Rathore, said. The police also said that the accused would be listed in the National Database on Sexual Offenders. Expressing deep concern over the death of the minors, the Meghalaya State Commission for Protection of Child Rights sought the “urgent implementation” of the model standard operating procedures for tracing missing or kidnapped children to ensure timely and effective intervention in such incidents.

Albinush Marak, the chief executive member of the Garo Hills Autonomous District Council (GHADC), said the council had adequate funds to pay five months’ pending salaries to its employees numbering more than 1,350. The amount includes ₹24.45 crore recently released by the State government headed by Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma. However, the Non-Gazetted Employees’ Association (NGEA) rejected the stopgap offer made by the Executive Committee of the council during a meeting on Monday (August 18, 2025).

Salaries of employees are usually paid by a council, a government within a larger State or federal system. The council is headed by the National People’s Party, of which the Chief Minister is the national president. Mr. Marak blamed the crisis in the GHADC on the random appointments made without interviews when the Congress party ruled the council almost a decade ago, which increased the number of employees to more than 2,300.

DCC president Martin George said a formal complaint had been submitted to the District Collector on the issue. He alleged that sensitive booths were finalised solely on the basis of a police report, which, he said, covered only around 60% of the vulnerable locations. As the cost of installing web cameras is being collected from candidates, he said the omission of key booths required scrutiny by the State Election Commission.

The dam for the project is planned at the confluence of the Dron, Shree, and Dilma Rivers, which form the Kulsi. The location is on the Assam-Meghalaya border, about 80 km southwest of Guwahati. Hundreds of villagers, who will be affected by the project, gathered at the Ukiam picnic spot on Thursday (September 25, 2025) to underscore the adverse impact of the dam on the ecology and livelihoods. The Assam-Meghalaya Joint Protection Committee, comprising groups such as the Garo National Council (GNC) and the Rabha National Council (RNC), organised the protest meeting. Vowing to resist the project “under any circumstances”, GNC president Enindra Marak said the work on the project could be deliberately delayed until after the 2026 Assembly polls. “The two State governments claim that only about 15 villages would be affected. This is misleading; the impact will extend from the hills of Meghalaya to the Brahmaputra,” he said. The Kulsi is a tributary of the Brahmaputra.

He added that Cherrapunji will be developed as a solar-powered destination thanks to the allocation of ₹260 crore for the project by the Union Government after it approved the roadmap and plan submitted by Meghalaya.

886,2025,The Hindu,886,"Tiruchi MP optimistic about dry port proposal after meeting Nirmala Sitharaman Tiruchi Member of Parliament Durai Vaiko’s meeting with Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday has raised the hope of establishing a dry port, an inland container depot, in Tiruchi. It has been a long-felt need of the trade and industry of the region as Tiruchi has emerged as one of the fastest-growing export hubs in the State. A wide range of goods, including engineering equipment, spare parts, fabricated material, food products, millets, and perishables such as vegetables and fruits are exported. While the exporters use the excellent air connectivity from Tiruchi to export vegetables and fruits, they depend on Chennai, Thoothukudi, Karaikal, or Kochi port to export other items. It is estimated that about 40 to 50 containers, each with a capacity of 25 tonnes, are transported by road every month from Tiruchi to these seaports. Industrialists and exporters from the region face high transport and handling costs, along with time-consuming formalities at the ports. Exporters are of the view that if a dry port is established in Tiruchi, they can complete the required documentation and other procedures locally, significantly reducing cost and time. Tiruchi MP Durai Vaiko had taken up the issue with the Finance Minister during his meeting on August 21 in New Delhi and impressed upon her the need to establish a dry port. He also subsequently met Minister of Ports, Shipping and Waterways Sarbananda Sonowal and a few other Ministers in New Delhi. They reportedly told him that the Union government would do the needful if suitable land was allotted for establishing a dry port in Tiruchi. The MP later met Tiruchi Collector V. Saravanan and urged him to take steps to allot 21 acres of land. However, there has been no progress on the proposal apparently due to some issues in identifying the land. Considering the availability of a large tract of land owned by the Tiruchi Corporation at Panjapur, which is located on the Tiruchi-Madurai Highway, and the availability of many u",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/tiruchi-mp-optimistic-about-dry-port-proposal-after-meeting-nirmala-sitharaman/article70349916.ece

Langrin was 95 when she died on October 28, 2020. She became a household name when she rejected a lucrative offer from the government to buy her land in the uranium-rich Domiasiat area of the State’s South West Khasi Hills district after the Atomic Minerals Directorate undertook an exploratory drilling for uranium deposits in 1993. “We observed her death anniversary as Anti-Uranium Day, reaffirming our strong and uncompromising stand against any bid to mine uranium in Domiasiat,” Lambokstar Marngar, the president of the Khasi Students’ Union (KSU), said on Tuesday (October 28, 2025). The primary reason behind this resolution was an office memorandum issued recently by the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change, exempting uranium mining from mandatory public consultations. “This exemption under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act is an assault on the rights of the indigenous people,” Mr. Marngar said. The State has one of the country’s largest uranium reserves in the Domiasiat, Wahkaji, Mawthabah, and their adjoining areas in the West Khasi Hills district. Locals have resisted attempts to explore and extract the radioactive substance. Leaders of the KSU’s district unit said they would never let Langrin, a symbol of courage, down. Locals and members of other organisations, including the Hynniewtrep Youth Council, recalled how the matriarch’s actions inspired her community to resist the potential environmental damage and health complications from uranium mining. “Money cannot buy me freedom,” she said, motivating locals against selling off their ancestral lands for the mining project.

Locals have resisted attempts to explore and extract the radioactive substance, citing health and environmental reasons. The Khasi Students’ Union (KSU), which led an anti-uranium movement for decades, reaffirmed its opposition to any move to start mining in Meghalaya. He said the memo excluding atomic, critical, and strategic minerals from public hearings under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act was disconcerting. “The exemption of public consultations is an assault on the rights of the indigenous people. We will oppose fresh attempts to explore uranium in Meghalaya,” KSU president Lambokstar Marngar said on Friday (September 19, 2025). The Hynniewtrep Youth Council, also representing the Khasi community, said the office memorandum underlined the Centre’s bid to extract uranium at any cost after failing for decades to convince the locals to give up their land. “This is a new strategy to snatch the people’s right to their land and resources, and to deny their right to live without being exposed to the dangers associated with uranium mining.

Members of the Garoland State Movement Committee (GSMC), led by its acting chairman, Balkarin Ch. Marak met Union Minister of Tribal Affairs, Jual Oram, on Tuesday (August 19,  2025) and submitted a memorandum seeking the creation of Garoland State under Article 3 of the Constitution of India. The Article empowers Parliament to form new States and reorganise existing State boundaries. The other representatives of GSMC included its publicity secretary, Chevibirth Koknal, assistant general secretary, Tony Balsam Ch. Marak, executive member, Amresh Ch. Marak and organising secretary Jason Tekrang. In the memorandum, the organisation said the demand for Garoland dates back to 1895, when a patriotic Garo leader named Sonaram R. Sangma first raised the cause for a separate homeland during British rule. Later, leaders such as Mody K. Marak and Emonsing M. Marak sought the unification of the Garo-inhabited areas in Assam and the Mynmensing region (now in Bangladesh) within the Indian Union. The proposed Garoland map roughly covers the western half of Meghalaya, comprising 24 of the State’s 60 Assembly constituencies. “Among the other issues we highlighted include the salary crisis in the Garo Hills Autonomous District Council (GHADC), infrastructure requirements, cultural recognition, and the preservation of traditional institutions through the construction of Nokpantes (bachelors’ dormitories) for each of the 12 Garo sub-tribes,” Mr. Tony Marak said.

But, Aavin’s price was still ₹20 less than the one fixed by the federation in Karnataka. Butter prices have risen by around 15%-20% in the last two months, which is a major reason for the hike in prices of Aavin ghee. “Due to rain, milk production has been affected that has also led to an increase in butter prices,” said a source in Aavin.

This was despite overall budget pressures, with governments globally (excluding the U.S) recognising their transformational potential for modernising public services and achieving critical mission objectives, the firm observed.

The top four technologies government CIOs (not including the U.S.) plan to increase investments in next year are cybersecurity (85%), AI (80%), generative AI (80%) and cloud platforms (76%), as per Gartner.

The event spotlighted programmes such as Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U) and the Smart Cities Mission. Yet, beneath the visible challenges of pollution, heat and inequity lies a quieter emergency — a surge in heart disease and diabetes. Cardiovascular ailments are a main reason now for urban deaths, with prevalence rate nearly twice that of rural India, and witnessing more patients under the age of 50 years. Daily life in urban India — long commutes, polluted air, shrinking green spaces, and rising stress — has resulted in rising health risks. Access to care remains limited, even as cities promise opportunity. Yet, few have addressed this crisis through deliberate, evidence-based planning. The distribution of health care still follows profit, not need. Hospitals cluster where land values and paying populations are high, while vast areas remain underserved. Market logic, not medical necessity, continues to decide who receives care and who does not. As India urbanises, fragmented planning risks locking in sedentary lifestyles, pollution and inequity. Integrating heart health into urban planning through coordinated land use, transport, housing, and green space is now essential. For decades, development has operated in silos: transport divorced from housing, green initiatives sidelined, and health rarely considered. Expressways have encouraged car dependence, fast-food zones have caused unhealthy diets, and traffic congestion has given rise to rising pollution. Integrated planning offers a remedy. Compact, mixed-use neighbourhoods can cut commutes, reduce emissions and promote active living. The World Health Organization (WHO)’s Healthy Cities Network shows that embedding health in governance lowers chronic disease risks.

Over the past few weeks, the U.S. has intensified pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro byconducting strikesin the Caribbean and Pacific waters against alleged drug traffickers and bolstering its troop presence in the region. Washington insists that the operations are part of its ‘war on drugs’, and accuses Mr. Maduro of heading Cartel de los Soles, which the U.S. has designated as a foreign terrorist organisation. The U.S. troop deployment includes two amphibious ready groups with over 4,500 Marines and sailors. The Pentagon has also sent aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford. Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, is hosting F-35 fighter jets and MQ-9 Reaper drones, just across Venezuela’s coast. In October, the U.S. flew a pair of supersonic B-1 Lancer bombers along the coast of Venezuela. It is now evident what Mr. Trump seeks — a regime change in Caracas. And Venezuela’s right-wing opposition, led by Nobel Peace Laureate María Corina Machado, has wholeheartedly endorsed America’s plans. Mr. Maduro, a self-styled socialist, stands accused of rigging the 2024 presidential election, and Venezuela’s economy has suffered a near-total collapse on his watch, prompting millions to flee. He shares responsibility for Venezuela’s current condition. But the U.S. is not an innocent actor either. Washington’s sanctions have been a major contributor to Venezuela’s economic crisis. In the past, U.S. and several European governments had recognised Juan Guaidó, an opposition figure, as the President in a bid to undermine the Maduro government.

MTP Kolasib unit general secretary Vanlallungtiawia toldPTIthat the Sairang-Vairengte and Kolasib-Bairabi sections of NH-306 are in deplorable condition after they were repaired in July and August and have become dangerous for trucks and other vehicles to travel on. He said many vehicles have met with accidents and were damaged due to the dilapidated condition of the roads. State officials said that repair work of the national highway is in progress. Mr. Vanlallungtiawia alleged that though the State government and companies are currently repairing the roads, the work is moving at a snail's pace. The MTA and JAC have demanded that the State government and NHIDCL expedite the repair work as winter season is approaching, he said. ""The repair work is moving at a slow pace and if it continues in this pace, the authorities would not be able to complete the work before the rainy season next year,"" he said. Mr. Vanlallungtiawia also alleged negligence by the NHIDCL. ""The Centre's construction agency does not pay due importance to roads managed by it in Mizoram,"" he alleged. Earlier, commercial vehicle operators had warned that they will not hold responsibility in the event of any untoward incident against the NHIDCL if it fails to repair the highways on time.

903,2025,The Hindu,903,"The new action plan on AMR needs a shot in the armPremium India’s new National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (NAP-AMR 2.0) — (2025-29) — has been released at a time when Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is affecting human health, veterinary practices, aquaculture, agriculture, waste systems and the entire food chain. Antibiotic residues, resistant organisms and environmental discharge connect these sectors in powerful ways. AMR does not remain confined to hospitals. It moves through soil, water, livestock, markets and food systems, making it a true One Health challenge. Therefore, any national plan must be matched by real and coordinated action across all levels of governance. The first National Action Plan on AMR, launched in 2017, was a significant step forward. It brought AMR into national consciousness, encouraged multi-sectoral participation, improved laboratory networks, expanded national surveillance and supported stewardship. It also placed AMR firmly within a One Health framework, recognising the links between human health, animal health and the environment. Despite this progress, implementation during the first plan period remained limited at the State level. Only a small group of States — Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Sikkim and Punjab — developed formal State Action Plans, and only a few moved meaningfully into execution. The majority continued to rely on fragmented activities within individual sectors; State-wide, multisectoral One Health structures did not take shape in most parts of the country. This slow uptake was not due to a shortage of national effort, but because the major determinants of AMR fall under State jurisdiction. Health administration, hospital functioning, pharmacy regulation, veterinary oversight, agricultural antibiotic practices, food-chain monitoring and waste governance are controlled by State departments. National guidance alone cannot create uniform implementation when the operational levers sit elsewhere. India’s broader public health experience show",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-new-action-plan-on-amr-needs-a-shot-in-the-arm/article70346165.ece

However, people and vehicles under emergency services will be exempted from the strike, Mr. Jongte added. Acccording to Mr. Jongte, the party had strongly opposed the adoption of the FCAA by the State Assembly and urged the Zoram People’s Movement (ZPM) government headed by Chief Minister Lalduhoma to withdraw the resolution adopting the law.

The bypoll was necessitated following the death of incumbent MNF legislator Lalrintluanga Sailo in July. For the ZPM, the result is likely to influence the upcoming Lai Autonomous District Council (LADC) elections on December 3 and the Aizawl Municipal Corporation (AMC) poll, which is likely to be held early next year. If the ZPM wins the polls, it would boost the party’s morale amid mounting criticism from Opposition parties, observers said. For the MNF, the bypoll holds special significance, as a defeat would further reduce its strength in the 40-member Assembly and jeopardise its claim to the post of Leader of Opposition. A party requires at least 10 MLAs for the position, and the MNF currently has nine following Sailo’s death.

The narrow-banded rain snake (Smithophis leptofasciatus) has been described in the latest issue ofTaprobanica: The Journal of Asian Biodiversity. The authors of the study — Lal Muansanga, Jayaditya Purkayastha, Vanlal Hruaia, Mathipi Vabeiryureilai, Lal Biakzuala, Ht Decemson, Hmar T. Lalremsanga, and Sanath C. Bohra — proposed ‘Ruahrul’ as the new-to-science snake’s Mizo name. Rain snakes are so named because they become more active and visible during the rainy season. The authors said the description was based on detailed morphological and molecular analyses of two collected specimens, along with observations of several live individuals. The new species is distinguished by its narrow, incomplete creamish-white or yellowish-lime transverse bands on a shiny black body — features that set it apart from its close relatives. “Our study confirmed that this snake, previously identified asSmithophis bicolor, is a genetically and morphologically distinct species. It not only adds to the growing diversity within the genusSmithophis, but also redefines the distribution of previously known species,” Dr. Purkayastha, one of the corresponding authors, said. The species nameleptofasciatusis a Greek and Latin hybrid, meaning ‘narrow-banded’, referencing the snake’s distinctive dorsal markings. The narrow-banded rain snake was found inhabiting humid, shaded microhabitats near small streams in forests between 900 and 1,200 meters above sea level. Its semi-aquatic, nocturnal lifestyle was revealed through field observations during the monsoon.

The trade expo is being held at Lammual (formerly Assam Rifles ground) in the heart of Aizawl. The individuals were found with either expired ILP or not possessing the travel permit, he said. Non-state residents, particularly non-tribal people, are required to obtain an ILP to enter Mizoram. ILP is an official travel document issued to Indian citizens for entry into protected areas, including Mizoram.

The ultimate aim is to connect the Northeast States with Kolkata Port via the Bay of Bengal, using the Sittwe Port in Myanmar, built by India, for both strategic and economic reasons. This would also help reduce the transport burden on the Siliguri corridor.

The authorities have also collected the biometric and biographic data of 10.84% of the 2,354 refugees from Bangladesh’s Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), the officials said. The exercise has been affected by slow or no internet connectivity and difficulty in identifying the refugees living outside the designated relief camps. However, the achievement so far is deemed significant because of the State government’s earlier stand that collecting the biometrics would amount to “discrimination against people who are our blood and kindred brothers and sisters.” Chin people from Myanmar have been trickling into Mizoram since the military coup in the neighbouring country in February 2021. The Bawms from the CHT began taking shelter in Mizoram after a military offensive by the Bangladesh armed forces a year later.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to inaugurate the 51.38 km Bairabi-Sairang railway line on September 13. The Northeast Frontier Railway completed the ₹5,020 crore project recently. Bairabi is close to Mizoram’s border with Assam, while Sairang is 18 km short of the State’s capital, Aizawl. “Aizawl has more than 30 beggars, most of them outsiders. There is a fear that the railways might bring in more beggars,” Mizoram’s Social Welfare Minister Lalrinpuii said after introducing the Mizoram Prohibition of Beggary Bill, 2025. She said the State needed a mechanism to control unforeseen situations due to the possible influx of beggars from outside the State once the railway services began. Ms. Lalrinpuii, however, said the objective of the Bill was not only to prohibit begging but to assist and rehabilitate beggars by offering sustainable livelihood options. Opposition MLAs in the 40-member House, including Mizo National Front leader Lalchhandama Ralte, stated the Bill was against the Christian faith and would bring a bad reputation to the State. They suggested a robust community project to stop beggary. The Bill was passed after Chief Minister Lalduhoma stated that it prescribes a collective effort involving the government, NGOs, and churches to ensure the State is free of beggars.

918,2025,The Hindu,918,"How will the railway to Sairang help in regional connectivity? | ExplainedPremium The story so far:The Indian Railways recently commissioned the new 51.38 km track to Sairang, 18 km short of Mizoram’s capital Aizawl. It raises hopes for India’s ambitious Act East Policy which envisages rail and road links with Southeast Asia. Mizoram had 1.5 km of metre gauge railway track connecting Bairabi in the State’s Kolasib district to Assam’s Silchar before the gauge conversion project, sanctioned in 2000, was undertaken. The extension of this project to Sairang, which entailed laying a 51.38 km track, began in 2008-09, but the progress was slow due to inclement weather, a difficult and landslide-prone terrain, manpower shortage, and issues with transporting construction materials. The project was part of the Indian Railways’ plan in the early 2010s to connect all the northeastern State capitals to the country’s rail network, although the Sairang railway station is 18 km short of Mizoram’s capital, Aizawl. The Bairabi-Sairang section, which received safety clearance in June 2025 and awaits formal inauguration, has 48 tunnels with a total length of 12.85 km and 142 bridges. The project cost more than ₹5,020 crore and the lives of 18 workers when the bridge with the tallest pier collapsed during construction in August 2023. Landlocked Mizoram’s fastest access to the rest of the country is through air travel. The Aizawl-Silchar highway, also via Sairang, is the second-fastest option that consumes at least five hours.

919,2025,The Hindu,919,"New Railway line brings new hope for Mizoram’s handicrafts “For years we could not send our bamboo and other handicraft materials to the rest of the country. Now, with the new railway line, we hope artisans can finally earn more,” says Mafaka, a 40-year-old craftsman who runs a handicraft shop in Aizawl. His words capture the long-awaited relief and optimism felt by Mizoram’s artisan community as the state is finally linked to India’s national railway network. The opening of the 51.38-km Bairabi–Sairang broad-gauge railway line, constructed by Indian Railways, is being hailed as a turning point for Mizoram. Built at a cost of over ₹8,000 crore,the line was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modion September 13. For the first time, Aizawl, the hill state’s capital, will have direct railway connectivity with the rest of the country. For Mr Mafaka and many others in the handicraft sector, the new line is not just about improved mobility, but about economic survival. “Until now, transporting goods by road meant exhausting journeys that took too long, while flights were too costly. Train travel offers an affordable option and will help us send bamboo crafts, cane products, and handwoven textiles to markets across India,” he says. Handicrafts have long been Mizoram’s cultural and economic strength. The state is especially known for its intricate bamboo and cane work like baskets, furniture, utensils, and decorative items as well as its textiles, particularly the Puanchei, a ceremonial wrap woven with traditional motifs. Despite strong demand outside the state, limited connectivity meant artisans could rarely access larger markets. Speaking to The Hindu, a senior official from the Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR), which constructed the line, explained: “Mizoram’s handicrafts are in high demand across India. But transportation bottlenecks prevented them from reaching markets. This railway line changes that story.” The Bairabi–Sairang line includes 48 tunnels stretching 12.85 km in total, 55 major bridges including the Krung Bri",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mizoram/new-railway-line-brings-new-hope-for-mizorams-handicrafts/article70042710.ece

During his second visit to Mizoram after becoming the Prime Minister in 2014, Mr. Modi launched projects worth ₹9,000 crore, and addressed a public rally virtually from Lengpui Airport near Aizawl as he could not reach the venue, Lammual Ground in the heart of the city, due to heavy rain.

""For a long time, some political parties in our country practiced vote-bank politics. Their focus was always on places that had more votes and seats. The entire Northeast, including states like Mizoram, suffered greatly because of this attitude. ""But our approach is very different — those who were earlier neglected are at the forefront now. Those who were once marginalised are now in the mainstream. For the past 11 years, we have been working for the development of the Northeast, and the region is becoming the growth engine of India,"" the PM said. He said Mizoram plays a major role in the Centre's 'Act East' policy and the Kaladan multimodal transit project and railway lines will connect the state with Southeast Asia.

926,2025,The Hindu,926,"What is Nagaland’s job quota issue? | ExplainedPremium The story so far:On April 26, an organisation of five “advanced” tribes in Nagaland set the Neiphiu Rio-led government a 30-day deadline to revise the job reservation policy for the State’s Backward Tribes (BTs). The government formed a panel on September 22 to examine the job quota policy, but the five-tribe body found fault with its nomenclature. Almost four years after it attained statehood in December 1963, Nagaland introduced a policy to reserve 80% of State government jobs for all indigenous Scheduled Tribes. The government identified 11 BTs in 1977 and apportioned for them what came to be known as “reservation within a reservation”. In August 2024, Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio told the 60-member Nagaland Assembly that 37% of non-technical and non-gazetted jobs are currently reserved for BTs. He said this quota is divided into 25% for seven BTs in eastern Nagaland comprising six districts — Kiphire, Longleng, Mon, Noklak, Shamator, and Tuensang — and 12% for the remaining four BTs. An April 2011 notification from the State’s Personnel and Administrative Reforms Department said the Chakhesang and Pochury tribes inhabiting Phek district will be clubbed together for half the 12%, while the Zeliang tribe will have 4% of government jobs reserved for them, and the remaining 2% will be reserved for the Sumi tribe in Kiphire district. Beyond Kiphire, the Sumis are among the five non-BT communities along with the Angamis, Aos, Lothas, and Rengmas. In September 2024, the Five Tribes Committee on Review of Reservation Policy (CoRRP) submitted a memorandum to the State government, requesting an assessment of the job quota system. The members of this committee are representatives of the apex social bodies of each of these five tribes. The committee argued that the policy was relevant in 1977, but it no longer reflects the prevailing socio-economic and educational landscape of the State. Its secretary, G.K.

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin attended the event. A few days ago, Ganesan suffered a fall in the bathroom and sustained head injuries, which led to his demise. A native of Thanjavur district, Ganesan was a passionate admirer of Carnatic music and made it a point of attending the annual Thyagaraja Aradhana in Thiruvaiyaru. His association with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) began in his school days, with his family being closely connected to the organisation. “He was a government employee, working as a Revenue Settlement Inspector, before resigning to become a full-time pracharak of the RSS. He worked primarily in the southern districts of Tamil Nadu and rose to become the chief organiser of the RSS during the Emergency,” said sources in the RSS. “His role in protecting the Hindu interest in Meenakshipuram religious conversions and Mandaikkadu communal riots were well appreciated by the nationalist leaders of yesteryears. His tireless efforts to bring peace and unity among Hindus in the caste nerve centres of Tamil Nadu, such as Puliangudi and Ramanathapuram, bore fruit, leading to harmony among the people,” says the website of the Nagaland Governor’s office.

Addressing a public rally in Manipur’s Senapati on his way back from his birthplace, Somdal village, to the NSCN (I-M)’s central headquarters near Dimapur in adjoining Nagaland, Mr. Muivah assured the Nagas that the group would never compromise on what it set out to do decades ago. “The only honourable negotiated political agreement shall be according to the letter and spirit of the Amsterdam Joint Communiqué and the Framework Agreement (August 2015), and the officially recognised Nagalim unique history, Nagalim sovereignty, Nagalim territory, and the Naga national flag, and the Naga national constitution,” Mr. Muivah said.

The name of the panel has also been changed from the Job Reservation Commission to the Commission for Review of Reservation. The new panel, announced on October 15, is composed entirely of senior government officials to ensure a “more balanced and neutral approach”. The earlier panel had members of organisations who belonged to tribes that are beneficiaries of the job quota policy. Government spokesperson K.G. Kenye said the reconstituted five-member committee will be chaired by former Development Commissioner R. Ramakrishna. “The committee has been given six months from the date of appointment to complete its review and submit recommendations to the government,” he said, admitting that the decision to make the panel “more neutral” followed petitions by the Five-Tribe Committee on Review of Reservation Policy (CoRRP). The CoRRP represents the Ao, Angami, Lotha, Rengma, and Sumi communities. Mr. Kenye stated that the renaming of the commission reflects the government’s acknowledgement that the issue goes beyond job quota. “The government has listened to all sides to form a committee that will bring clarity, fairness, and finality to a long-pending issue that has stirred both political and administrative debate in Nagaland,” he said. The demand to review the job quota policy gained momentum earlier this year. The CoRRP argued that the policy, introduced in 1977, no longer reflects the current socio-economic and educational realities of the Naga tribes in Nagaland.

The agitators, under the aegis of Nagaland Medical Students’ Association (NMSA), staged the demonstration outside the Department of Health and Family Welfare office in Kohima. The demonstration comes in the wake of the state government issuing a notification on August 18, announcing the regularisation of 280 COVID-era appointees, including medical officers, dentists, AYUSH practitioners, and nurses, through a departmental screening. The NMSA contended that this bypasses constitutionally mandated recruitment processes and violates the Nagaland Health Service Rules, 2006, which require all Class-I gazetted officer posts to be filled up through the Nagaland Public Service Commission (NPSC). “This decision undermines meritocracy and violates Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution, which guarantee equality before law and equal opportunity in public employment,” NMSA president Pito S. Rochill said during the protest. The student body demanded an immediate revocation of the August 18 notification and insisted that all future appointments in the health sector be conducted through open competitive examinations via NPSC. “We are not against those who served during the COVID-19 pandemic. But if regularisation must happen, it should be done through fair and open procedures,” NMSA general secretary Bonoto P. Zimo said. They argued that the government’s decision to bypass written exams for Class-I posts sets a dangerous precedent. Under the Nagaland Health Service Rules, recruitment for such posts requires 100% selection through NPSC. “Why are recruitment rules in place if they are not to be followed?” asked Mr. Rochill, calling the move “illegal and arbitrary”. When asked about reports of a court ruling related to the issue, NMSA leaders clarified that while a previous plea w",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nagaland/nagaland-medical-students-stage-protest-against-govt-decision-to-regularise-280-health-workers/article69993416.ece

The armed group wants New Delhi to recognise the Naga national flag and the Naga constitution, which it claims were part of the deal when the Framework Agreement was signed in August 2015. NSCN (I-M) expands to the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah). The group prefers to be called the National Socialist Council of Nagalim. “They [Government of India] started giving ultimatum… We were forced to tell them, come what may, we will stand our ground. We know who the Indians are and their history,” Mr. Muivah, 91, told journalists from the Gethsemane hall in Somdal on Tuesday (October 28, 2025). He reached Somdal, his birthplace, on October 22, six decades after he left home in 1964 to join the Naga freedom movement. He is scheduled to fly back to the NSCN (I-M)’s central headquarters near Nagaland’s Dimapur after a stopover in Manipur’s Senapati town on October 29. “…We will not come taking your (India’s) history to surrender to you. We will never do that… Whether it is today or tomorrow, Nagas are Nagas and Indians are Indians,” Mr. Muivah, the chief negotiator in the peace talks, said. “If you don’t come to understand us and appreciate, then there is no point for us going to you,” he said, insisting that the peace negotiators representing New Delhi understood his position. He claimed that the NSCN (I-M) has been clear about its position since the day it declared a truce in 1997 and that the Centre’s negotiators were aware of it.

941,2025,The Hindu,941,"Nagaland University to develop grammar for 18 Naga languages The Nagaland University has undertaken a project to develop written grammar for each of the 18 recognised Naga languages in the State. The project is in collaboration with the State’s Directorate of School Education, a statement from the university based in Zunheboto district’s Lumami said on Monday (September 1, 2025). The initiative seeks to provide structured pedagogical grammars for inclusion in school textbooks from Class 5 to Class 12, ensuring alignment with the National Education Policy 2020. Naga languages have been taught in schools for decades, but none have had a dedicated written grammar for the teaching-learning process. This initiative will address the gap by systematically documenting grammar—including parts of speech, tense and aspect, phrase and clause structures, and tone—while enriching vocabulary and clarifying orthography where necessary. The grammar developed under this initiative will be incorporated into school textbooks alongside prose, poetry, and translation, under the supervision of the State Council of Educational Research and Training and the Nagaland Board of School Education. Teacher training programmes have been planned to support the smooth integration of grammar teaching in classrooms, beginning with refresher courses hosted by the Nagaland University. The project is led by Mimi Kevichüsa Ezung, associate professor and Head of the university’s Department of Tenyidie. Tenyidie is the standardised form of the Angami language spoken by the Angami community of Nagaland as well as the speech community of nine other tribes, which collectively fall under the Tenyimia Group. “This endeavour is not merely an academic exercise but a cultural mission – one that seeks to preserve, strengthen, and promote the linguistic heritage of our people,” Jagadish K.

The church was dismantled in September for two reasons: at about 100 years, it was too old to be safe for prayer services; and it could yield the most strategic spot for a helicopter carrying a Naga leader — only slightly younger than the church itself — to land on October 22. Thuingaleng Muivah, the 91-year-old general secretary of the extremist National Socialist Council of Nagalim (NSCN) and a devout Christian, probably missed the church when he alighted from the chopper that carried him from adjoining Nagaland’s Dimapur via district headquarters Ukhrul, 25 kilometres from Somdal terrestrially. To most of the village’s 4,500 people around the chopper, however, the landing of their godfather on a spot once commanded by a house of god was surreal. Villagers wait as NSCN (I-M) chief Thuingaleng Muivah arrives in his home village Somdal after 60 years in Ukhrul district of Manipur on Wednesday.

On Wednesday (August 6, 2025), the State Cabinet approved the constitution of a seven-member Job Reservation Commission to be headed by a retired IAS officer of the Nagaland cadre. An official statement said the committee would be composed of three officers and a member each from the Eastern Nagaland People’s Organisation (ENPO), Central Nagaland Tribes Council (CNTC), and Tenyimi Union Nagaland (TUN). The Committee on Review of Reservation Policy (CoRRP) of the five tribes — Angami, Ao, Lotha, Rengma, and Sumi — criticised the outcome of the Cabinet meeting on the backward tribe reservation issue as a repetition of the meeting on June 12. “It (Cabinet) chose to ignore our core demands and rather went ahead with the composition of the reservation review commission, which includes civil society organisations in the form of the CNTC, ENPO, and TUN,” a CoRRP statement issued by its convenor Tesinlo Semy and member-secretary G. K. Zhimomi said. “The partisan attitude of the government spokesperson in throwing up wild imaginary figures on government employment, as well as linking the reservation review commission’s outcome with the next census, is an insult to our movement,” the duo said.

On Tuesday, the rupee settled 43 paise down at an all-time closing low of 89.96 against the US dollar, largely owing to continued short-covering from speculators and sustained importer demand for the American currency.

According to a notification from Khruohituonuo Rio, the Secretary in charge of the Nagaland Legislative Assembly Secretariat, the Speaker admitted Mr. Nienü’s “notice on matters of urgent public importance” under relevant rules. The notification said that the subject matter – prohibition of satanic worship in Nagaland – will be taken up in the Assembly after Question Hour on Tuesday (September 2, 2025). Mr. Nienü’s letter to the Speaker on August 18 read, “…as a Christian State, we need to uphold our religion and be faithful believers and followers of God Almighty. It is truly shocking to see our younger generation embracing satanic/Devil worship openly in total disregard for our religion and the teachings of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.” The MLA pointed out that the credo of ‘Nagaland for Christ’ made it imperative for public leaders to stand by the ideals and principles as laid down in the Bible. “Therefore, I urge your good office for a discussion and also for passing a resolution to enact laws prohibiting and preventing satanic/Devil worship within the territory of Nagaland,” he wrote.

He never pulled through the loss of his native Nice to France as the price for the French support for the Risorgimento. To many Nagas, specifically in Manipur,the 91-year-old Thuingaleng Muivahis the hero of the Naga-inhabited world, divided between two countries — India and Myanmar. This world, covering more than 57,400 sq. km, includes the 13,329 sq. km Naga Self-Administered Zone of Myanmar’s Sagaing Division. Mr. Muivah is based at Camp Hebron, the central headquarters of his armed organisation, the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (NSCN), in adjoining Nagaland, but Manipur’s pre-bifurcation Ukhrul district is where his heart is, like most other members of his Tangkhul community, which dominates the district. Ukhrul has, thus, been central to the goal of the unified Naga homeland of the NSCN, more familiar to the world beyond as the Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland or the NSCN (I-M) that he has led since April 30, 1988. The Manipur government perceived this goal, though subdued since the NSCN (I-M) signed the Framework Agreement with the government of India on August 3, 2015, as a threat to the State’s territorial integrity and banned his entry until recently. Two factors facilitated Mr. Muivah’s visit to his village, Somdal, 25 km from Ukhrul town, on October 22, after six decades: his ill-health and the changed political scenario since the ethnic conflict that broke out in Manipur in May 2023, realigning the equations among the State’s three major communities – the Kuki-Zo, Meitei, and Naga.

Mr. Graham was supposed to be the main speaker at the programme and also attend the inaugural session of the 10-day Hornbill Festival, which will start on Monday. But he could not attend the programme after his travel documentation and clearance were delayed. PAP is a travel document required by foreigners to visit certain sensitive areas in the country. Mr. Rio had on November 18 and 28 written to the Union Home Minister Amit Shah, requesting early clearance of visas for foreign tourists, and urging that the PAP regime for Nagaland be lifted permanently, which was reimposed from December last year. The CM said that although the Centre has relaxed the PAP requirement for Nagaland from December 1 to 10 to facilitate the Hornbill Festival, the temporary measure ""does not solve the larger issue"".

Forex traders said strong dollar demand from corporates, importers and foreign portfolio investors pressurised the rupee.  Moreover, elevated crude oil prices further dented investor sentiments. At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened at 89.70 against the U.S. dollar before dropping to record low level of 89.85, down 32 paise from its previous close. On Monday (December 1, 2025), the rupee after sinking to 89.79 in intraday trade, settled at 89.53 against the U.S. dollar. ""The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been selling dollars in the market, but it has also bought dollars when Indian rupee rose thus keeping the demand intact,"" said Anil Kumar Bhansali, head of treasury and executive director Finrex Treasury Advisors LLP. Mr. Bhansali further noted that, the fundamentals of the Indian economy like a high Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 8.2% have been overweighed by the dollar demand. ""The uncertainties surrounding the India-U.S. trade deal have not helped the matters and have actually aggravated the dollar buying syndrome,"" Mr. Bhansali said.

Orissa HC Judge Justice Dixit Krishna Shripad, while delivering the direction said, “it is a matter of common knowledge that in a vibrant democracy like ours, the period elections are held to the Parliament and State Legislatures, as festival of lights. For the conduct of elections and their preparatory works, services of teachers too are requisitioned.” “Impugned letter of the kind, which provides for MPs/MLAs recommending transfer of teachers, has the potential of creating a seamless nexus between the political parties and candidates and the community of teachers,” Justice Mr Shripad mentioned in his order. “This would not augur well to the system. One needs no research to visualize the fruits of poisonous tree that would grow on the soil of such nexus. It is teachers, more particularly those who teach up to the level of Standard X level, who mould the younger generation as citizenry in the making. As of necessity, teachers have to maintain safe distance from political parties and elected representatives,” he remarked. The single judge Bench dismissed the arguments of government advocates saying the contention that notification is only recommendatory and that it does not bind the transfer committee while making decisions, appears attractive at the first blush. The HC directed that teachers who were transferred by recommendation of MPs and MLAs would continue in their present schools till the end of the academic year. “Even if the transfer orders are set aside, those teachers who have reported for duty at the transferred places, should continue till after the expiry of academic year, so that the community of students is not put to prejudice,” the judgment says.",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/odisha/orissa-hc-quashes-govt-order-allowing-mps-mlas-to-recommend-teachers-transfer/article70331238.ece

The deal, unveiled by the companies on Monday, comes as Nvidia has carried out a range of investments, such as those in OpenAI and Anthropic, to try to cement its dominance in the artificial intelligence market. The Synopsys deal is about shifting the work of several high-tech industries that are just starting to adopt AI away from central processing units used in the past and toward the graphics processing unit chips sold by Nvidia. Synopsys software is widely used in designing everything from computer chips to jet engines. Engineers use its tools to simulate those designs virtually in computers before committing to expensive prototype manufacturing. Those simulations can take weeks, but could be sped up to a few hours using Nvidia’s chips, the CEOs of the two companies said during a press conference. “The order of magnitude speed-up is going to unlock opportunities that have never been possible before,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in announcing the deal. Synopsys and Nvidia are customers of one another. Nvidia’s flurry of investments has raised concerns that it is paying customers to buy its chips. Synopsys CEO Sassine Ghazi said the Nvidia cash will give Synopsys “optionality” as it adapts its software for Nvidia chips. “There is no intention or commitment to use that $2 billion to purchase Nvidia GPUs,” Ghazi said during the press conference. “This is something that we do on a normal course of business.” Both CEOs said the deal is non-exclusive, and Ghazi said Synopsys is open to working with other chipmakers. “If an AMD or an Intel or whichever customer wanting to capture a similar opportunity (approaches Synopsys), it’s not exclusive.

The iPhone maker last month challenged India’s antitrust penalty law which allows the regulator to use global turnover when calculating the penalties, calling the legislation one that could lead to disproportionate fines for cases where the breach occurred only in India. Apple argued it risks facing a fine of up to $38 billion after it was found to have breached laws in a case where Tinder-owner Match and Indian startups succeeded in convincing the watchdog the tech firm’s in-app fee hurts smaller players, and is anti-competitive. A final decision on the case, including the fine, is still pending. On Monday, a lawyer for the Competition Commission of India (CCI) accused Apple of trying to “stall the proceedings” dating back to 2021. Apple’s counsel urged the court to prevent the regulator from taking coercive steps. Judges at the Delhi High Court asked the CCI to file a detailed response to Apple’s arguments. Apple denies wrongdoing, saying it is a smaller player than Google’s dominant Android platform.

K-fried chicken is double fried making it crispier and juicier.“ The outlet in Koramangala, Bengaluru Sean says when he visited India the first time in 2023,he was surprised to see how popular Korean food and culture was. “There was such an appetite for everything Korean. I was visiting malls in Mumbai and saw Korean menus. I even met the team of McDonald’s last year, in regards for sourcing.

Under this policy approved by Cabinet under chairmanship of Chief Minister Mohan Majhi, the State government intends to attract leading multinational corporations (MNCs) to establish and expand their GCCs in Odisha by offering a robust ecosystem of world-class infrastructure, skilled talent, and progressive incentives. “Over the last decade, Odisha has steadily evolved into a promising hub for Information Technology (IT) and IT-enabled Services (ITES), supported by a forward- looking IT Policy and a growing pool of skilled professionals. This transformation aligns with the broader trend of GCCs expanding into Tier-Il cities to leverage cost advantages and regional talent,” the government said issuing a statement.

However, the slide of the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), one of the country’s dominant regional forces over two and a half decades,to a distant third positiondelivers a momentous signal. Odisha’s political landscape is undergoing a decisive shift, and the era of Naveen Patnaik, a five-time Chief Minister known for his gracious and measured politics, may be approaching its end. The BJD supremo was widely criticised for not campaigning enough during the 2024 Assembly and Lok Sabha elections — an omission many believe contributed to the party’s debacle. This time, determined to avoid attracting that criticism again, he hit the campaign trail in Nuapada, twice joining the canvassing for party candidate Snehangini Chhuria. However, according to political observers, Mr. Patnaik’s rare outings may have harmed the party instead of helping it. The former Chief Minister, assisted by two long-time security personnel, appeared tired and frail as he walked to the dais and struggled to read out a few paragraphs at public meetings. For many in the BJD, the sight caused disillusionment — never had Mr. Patnaik’s aura as a mass leader taken such a visible hit as it did during campaigning for the Nuapada bypoll. The party’s troubles run deep. Gone are the days when securing a BJD ticket meant the election was as good as won. This time, the BJD struggled to find a suitable candidate after Jay Dholakia — son of four-term BJD MLA Rajendra Dholakia, whose death necessitated the bypoll — defected to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Mr. Dholakia polled 1,23,869 votes; the Congress nominee, Ghasiram Majhi, secured 40,121; and Ms. Chhuria of the BJD received just 38,408.

He was picked up from Rajasthan in May this year and sent to Bangladesh. “Interestingly, there was no way to repatriate Mr. Amir except through legal intervention, as he had been tagged under a case involving illegal entry into Bangladesh. Amid such a situation, the Central government is now trying to repatriate Mr. Amir to his Malda home to save face and avoid the legal blow for the illegal pushback,” the chairperson of migrant welfare board posted on social media. Earlier this month, the father of Mr. Amir filed a habeas corpus petition before the Calcutta High Court and the court has sought response from Rajasthan government and Union government.

The reinstatement of six expelled leaders in the Congress’s Rajasthan unit has stirred up political activity in the Opposition party, with the rival factions making an attempt to influence the decision-making process. The return of these leaders has also displayed a careful balancing by the party’s leadership, reflecting the efforts to maintain unity in the rank and file. The reinstated leaders include former three-time Barmer MLA Mewaram Jain, suspended over an obscene video and a gang-rape case, and five others expelled on the charges of disobedience, involvement in anti-party activities and indulging in acts that allegedly contributed to the Congress’s defeat in the 2023 State Assembly election. AICC in-charge of Rajasthan Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa sent a letter to Pradesh Congress Committee president Govind Singh Dotasra last week cancelling the previous expulsion of Mr. Jain, Balendu Singh Shekhawat, Sandeep Sharma, Balram Yadav, Arvind Damor, and Tejpal Mirdha. The PCC headquarters followed up with the formal orders restoring their party membership. According to the sources in the PCC, the party’s high command has sought to placate multiple factions within the organisation with the move, as Mr. Jain and a few others are closely associated with former Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, while Mr. Mirdha is perceived to be close to former Deputy CM Sachin Pilot. Mr. Jain, who won three consecutive Assembly elections since 2008, was embroiled in a rape case filed by a married woman in Jodhpur two years ago. The PCC chief suspended him in January 2024 after his obscene videos were circulated online, but a special court let him off in July 2024 after accepting the police’s final report.

The rising incidence of breast and cervical cancer in women indicated to the need for early detection and treatment, Dr. Kabra said. The highest number of 2,837 patients, estimated as 332.24 per one lakh population, were reported from Jaipur, followed by 1,031 from Alwar, 855 from Ajmer, 685 from Sikar, and 649 from Jhunjhunu. The average cancer incidence in the State is estimated at 134.57 cases per one lakh population, which is significantly above India’s national average of 113 cases. Dr. Kabra said this analysis would guide policymakers in planning interventions effectively.

Kar protest rally: two Kolkata doctors appear before police Senior doctors Dr. Punya Brata Gun and Dr. Tamonas Chaudhuri, who were issued summons over a bicycle protest rally demanding justice for the R.G. Kar victim, appeared at the Thakurpukur police station in Kolkata on Monday. Multiple protest rallies were organised on August 8 and 9 by activists and civil society groups to mark one year of the rape and murder of the doctor at the R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital. Dr. Gun and Dr. Chaudhuri are associated with Abhaya Mancha, a civil society group formed to seek justice for the victim. On August 8, Abhaya Mancha had called for a bicycle rally from Thakurpukur to College Street. “The summons were issued on August 9 regarding restrictions on cycle movement on the National Highway at a particular time. Today [Monday], my clients appeared before the investigating officers and were asked questions such as their place of residence. My clients said they have been on the streets for a year demanding justice for the R.G. Kar victim. Instead of nabbing the real culprits, the police are sending summons to protesters,” advocate Shamim Ahmed, who is representing the two doctors, told The Hindu. In the summons sent by the police, it was mentioned that it pertains to an investigation of a case lodged against them on August 8 under multiple sections of the BNS, including 285 (danger or obstruction in public way or line of navigation), 235 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), and 3(5) (committing a crime together with a shared intention). Section 8B of the National Highway Act (punishment for mischief by injury to NH) was also mentioned. “We do not know why we have been summoned, but it is likely because we are at the forefront of the protests. This is probably an attempt to intimidate other protesters,” Dr. Gun told mediapersons before entering the police station. Dr. Chaudhuri said during the bicycle rally, protesters and the police “exercised mutual cooperation and it concluded smoothly and successfully”.",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/rg-kar-protest-rally-two-kolkata-doctors-appear-before-police/article69920895.ece

A resolution to this effect was passed during the party’s 25th Congress in Chandigarh. The party urged the Government of India to vote consistently in support of Palestine at the United Nations and to extend humanitarian assistance to Palestinians. CPI Rajya Sabha MP P. Sandosh Kumar said the party also passed a resolution on Cuba, condemning the six-decade-long U.S. economic blockade, which it said has had a severe impact on the island’s economy and the well-being of its people. He added that the CPI expressed concerns regarding the recently announced Goods and Services Tax (GST) 2.0 reforms, dismissing the government’s claims as “hollow” and pointing out that the BJP’s economic policies have worsened inequality, burdening the middle- and lower-income classes while benefiting corporates. The party also demanded that Puducherry be included in the 16th Finance Commission, noting that Puducherry suffers a loss of ₹1,500–2,000 crore from the Central pool due to non-inclusion in the Central Finance Commission. In another resolution, the CPI criticised both the Central and Punjab governments for negligence in maintaining irrigation and drainage systems, which aggravated the recent floods in Punjab. Delegates unanimously condemned the Centre’s relief package of ₹1,600 crore as an insult to the people, noting that actual losses exceeded ₹25,000 crore. The party also called for a White Paper on flood relief and fund allocation. On public health, the party noted that central health spending remains below 2% of GDP and demanded an increase to 3% of GDP by 2027 and 10% by 2030, besides universal free healthcare for all citizens.

Reptile experts said the release of the 104 hatchlings at the Hadug Beel in Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary, about 55 km east of Guwahati, marked a significant step in Assam’s turtle conservation efforts.

Officials said the digitisation of more than 15 lakh land documents, including texts and maps, across the 8,970 sq. km BTR was completed a few weeks ago, ending decades of manual record-keeping. There are 10 tribal councils under the Sixth Schedule in the north-east - three each in Assam, Meghalaya, and Mizoram, and one in Tripura. Two of Assam’s councils, in Karbi Anglong-West Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao, were set up five decades before the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) was constituted in 2003. The BTC administers the BTR comprising five districts in northern and western Assam. The Sixth Schedule contains special provisions for the administration of tribal areas, empowering autonomous councils to manage land, forest, and local governance within their jurisdictions. However, these councils have often faced resource constraints, infrastructural gaps, and administrative hurdles. Officials said the BTR government’s adoption of technology-driven governance, including the e-office system, has demonstrated how such challenges can be addressed in line with the Digital India Mission. BTC Secretary Dhiraj Saud said the digitisation process began in 2023 to enhance transparency in land ownership and simplify customary landholding patterns. “The exercise involved ground-level surveys across all subdivisions of Baksa, Chirang, Kokrajhar, Tamulpur, and Udalguri districts.

A Bench of Chief Justice Shree Chandrashekhar and Justice Gautam Ankhad questioned the State on what legal basis the certificate had been denied when Mr. Ansari had already been acquitted of terror charges. Public prosecutor Mankhuwar Deshmukh submitted that guidelines framed in August 2014 disqualified Mr. Ansari and a confidential report suggested that he was still under watch. The matter is posted for Saturday as Mr. Ansari’s advocate did not appear.

In a letter to APSC Chairperson Debaraj Upadhaya on August 17, the Meitei Heritage Society (MHS) stated that question no 95 in the exam paper was malicious, disturbing, and misleading. The question was on the conflict between the Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities and the role of Arambai Tenggol and Meitei Leepun, two radical groups. “Such a one-sided portrayal is unbecoming of a Public Service Commission, whose mandate is to recruit public servants committed to fairness, impartiality, and service to the nation without prejudice,” the MHS said. The MHS expressed serious concern for “selectively targeting one community while ignoring publicly available data on the role of Chin-Kuki militants and their civil society organisations”. It cited reports by the National Investigation Agency, Central Bureau of Investigation, and a Supreme Court-appointed committee to make a point. “Such misrepresentation not only tarnishes the image of a community but also undermines the credibility of the Commission,” the Meitei group said, requesting the APSC to issue a clarification acknowledging the biased nature of the question and declare the objectionable question null and void, ensuring it is not used for evaluation purposes. “After considering our representation, the APSC informed us today (Tuesday) that it has decided to drop/delete/cancel question number 95,” an MHS spokesperson said.",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/assam-job-panel-to-drop-controversial-question-on-manipur-crisis/article69951789.ece
1002,2025,The Hindu,1002,"Virtual split in Akali Dal as its breakaway faction names party president The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), which has been going through a challenging phase over the past few years, faced another setback on Monday as the party faced a virtual split following the rebel faction announcing its new president. In the meeting in Amritsar of the Akal Takht-appointed committee, which was last year given the mandate to supervise the restructuring of the party, the breakaway faction on Monday declared former Akal Takht acting chief priest Giani Harpreet Singh as its president. Satwant Kaur was appointed chairperson of the Panthic (Sikh) council. The Akal Takht is the highest Sikh temporal seat. Ever since Sukhbir Singh Badal’s re-election as SAD president, the rebels had been alleging that the Akal Takht’s verdict of December 2, 2024 – which awarded religious punishments to him and several other party leaders for the “mistakes” committed by the Akali Dal-led government from 2007 to 2017 – was not implemented in letter and spirit. The temporal authority had issued directions to the working committee of SAD to constitute a panel to hold elections for the post of party president and office-bearers, which the rebels pointed out was not adhered to. Mr. Harpreet Singh was part of the Sikh clergy that had issued the December 2, 2024 verdict. In February, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee had dismissed his services as the jathedar of Takht Sri Damdama Sahib. With rebels staking claim to the party, the exchange of words between leaders of both the camps sharpened. Addressing the meeting, Mr. Harpreet Singh asserted that they were the “real” Akalis and “we would eventually take control of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, the Akali Dal symbol, and the Akali Dal office”. Reacting sharply, senior SAD leaders Mahesh Inder Singh Grewal and Daljit Singh Cheema dubbed the faction as an “Agency Dal”. The leaders said the faction of disgruntled elements has added a new chapter to the “old conspiracy to divide and weaken the Khalsa Panth and Punjab”",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/virtual-split-in-akali-dal-as-its-breakaway-faction-names-party-president/article69920754.ece

During the probe, the Bureau detected a transaction of ₹10 crore between Gulati's companies and firms run by the Majithia family, public prosecutor Preet Inderpal Singh said. Mr. Gulati was earlier questioned about the transaction, but he failed to give any satisfactory reply, Mr. Singh said.

The Bench of Justice Jyoti Singh dismissed the writ petition filed by Master Janmesh Sagar, who had argued that subjecting students to an admission test amounted to an unlawful screening procedure prohibited under Section 13 of the RTE Act and infringed upon the fundamental Right To Education under Article 21-A of the Constitution. The petitioner, represented by his father, had challenged the Delhi Government’s circular dated July 23, 2025, which laid down guidelines for admissions to Classes VI to VIII in CM SHRI Schools for the 2025-2026 academic session. He claimed that he was compelled to undergo an admission test on September 13, 2025, and was subsequently declared ‘failed’ when the result was announced on September 29, 2025. Before approaching the High Court, the petitioner had filed a writ petition under Article 32 of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court disposed of the petition on November 17, 2025, granting liberty to approach the High Court, which he did pursuant to that order. Appearing for the Delhi Government, Counsel Sameer Vashisht submitted that the controversy had already been settled by the 2012 Division Bench ruling in Social Jurist v. GNCTD, which upheld selection-based admissions into Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalayas at Class VI. He argued that CM SHRI Schools, like RPVVs, fall under the category of “specified category schools” and therefore the prohibition on screening under Section 13 of the RTE Act does not apply to Class VI admissions.

The Congress alleged that the deletion of voters’ names was being carried out to give “electoral advantage” to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

The State Congress chief said the Opposition party would not allow the BJP to succeed in its designs to omit the voters’ names in the Congress strongholds “in collusion with the Election Commission”.

Schools were asked to organise painting contests on the Ayodhya Ram Mandir and Indian warriors, and display exhibitions on the Ram temple.

The department will provide a platform for dialogue and cooperation between Rajasthani diaspora and the State government. The State Cabinet approved a proposal to establish the new department for national and international NRRs at a meeting convened at the Chief Minister’s Office in Jaipur. Other decisions included the approval for the global capacity centre policy and the creation of a joint venture company for establishment of new coal-based thermal power and solar power projects. The department would lay down a policy framework to extend the benefits of the government’s schemes to NRRs and strengthen their relations with the State, Industries Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore said at a press conference after the Cabinet meeting. “Besides addressing their issues, the department will organise events and exchange programmes for NRRS,” Mr. Rathore said. Chief Minister Bhajan Lal Sharma had announced the new department’s creation at an NRR conclave held during the Rising Rajasthan Global Investment Summit here in December 2024. The first Pravasi Rajasthani Diwas will also be observed in Jaipur on December 10, along with the ‘Rising Rajasthan’ partnership conclave, to harness the expertise of global diaspora across key sectors. The Rajasthan Foundation has so far been functioning as the State’s nodal department for diaspora outreach. Mr. Rathore said the approval for the global capacity centre policy would lead to the creation of over 200 GCCs by 2030, establishing Rajasthan as a global innovation and investment hub and creating 1.50 lakh employment opportunities. “Rajasthan will contribute significantly to the country’s 100 billion U.S. dollar GCC market.

Mr. Jain’s victory dealt a major blow to the BJP, which was confident of its influence in the Hadoti region. Mr. Jain maintained his lead throughout the counting of votes, while Mr. Suman faced a tough challenge from independent candidate and Congress rebel Naresh Meena, who was initially in second place. Mr. Meena stood a close third with just 159 votes less than Mr. Suman, who secured 53,959 votes. Former Minister and four-time MLA Mr. Jain is an influential leader in south-eastern Rajasthan’s Hadoti region with a long political career. His proximity to former Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, in whose tenure he served as the Mines Minister, ensured the Congress ticket for the bypoll for him despite his defeat to BJP’s Kanwar Lal Meena in the 2023 State Assembly election. The by-election was necessitated by Kanwar Lal’s disqualification following his conviction in a 20-year-old criminal case. Fifteen candidates were in the fray, while Mr. Naresh Meena’s entry made the contest triangular. The constituency, created in 2008, recorded a voter turnout of 80.21% during the polling held on November 11. Senior BJP leader and former CM Vasundhara Raje campaigned for Mr. Suman, but his low profile as the Pradhan of Baran panchayat samiti made it difficult for her to garner support for the party in the Assembly segment situated adjacent to her home district, Jhalawar. Mr. Jain’s decisive victory has also come as a morale booster for Congress ahead of the upcoming panchayat and municipal elections in the State.

Yet, they did not expect Thursdays to be their best-selling day of the week when Anupa Tamling, the District Magistrate, experimented with Prayas almost a year ago after finding that farmers and villages engaged in small-scale industries struggle with visibility, value, and volume. Only SHGs, farmer-producer organisations (FPOs), and rural cooperatives were allowed to set up 15 stalls at the Collectorate, provided they maintain cleanliness, shun single-use plastic, and avoid selling pre-manufactured goods.

A group of believers walk the streets at midnight, carrying a cross, chanting intense verses. The persistent, guttural hymn chanting, known as ‘Devastha Vili’ is believed to exorcise lost or evil spirits. The continuation of a centuries-old ritual, the Devastha Vili has an intriguing history, says Maridas Kalloor, whose recent book,Devasth Aroopathilekkulla Vili, is a deep dive into the evolution of the practice.

Believed to have been composed by Roman Catholic missionary Saint Francis Xavier in Portuguese when he came to Kochi’s shores in the 16th century, the Devastha Vili could have been a clever blend of various European lent traditions and ritualistic practices observed in the region, says Maridas. “For the recent converts to Christianity, who were from a background well-entrenched in ritualistic devotion, the use of bells, the holy cross and the loud chanting (in Devastha) would have been easy to relate to and adapt,” says Maridas. He draws interesting parallels between traditions such as Fogareus, which is observed during the Holy Week in towns such as Braga and Sardoal in Portugal, where locals dressed in cloaks or dark robes take out a procession in the dead of the night, carrying torches. “Designed as a deliverance for souls in purgatory, the hymns are chanted loudly.

The RTI activists found that conservation funding for West Bengal’s ASI sites is significantly below pre-pandemic levels, indicating a continued neglect of heritage sites and buildings. The RTI response, accessed by the Sabar Institute, highlights prolonged gaps in conservation funding in the post-pandemic period, even as public interest and footfall at major sites began to recover. Opinion:A thumbs down for the ‘Adopt a Heritage’ scheme According to data shared by the ASI in response to the RTI, monuments in the districts including Cooch Behar, Dakshin Dinajpur, Darjeeling, Malda, Murshidabad, and Purba Medinipur saw no expenditure on upkeep over the two-year span. The lack of maintenance has also been felt in neighbouring Sikkim, where prominent sites like Rabdentse and Dubdi Monastery also received no funding during the same two years. However, the number of visitors has risen post-pandemic, especially to popular sites such as Metcalfe Hall, Hazarduari Palace, Cooch Behar Palace, and the Bishnupur temples.

Parents Lucky-II and Mirak gave birth to two cubs on June 15, but the park authorities announced the “significant milestone” on Friday (August 1, 2025). The cubs form the pair’s first litter together. “This birth is especially heartening as it comes after a difficult seven-year period in the history of the Red Panda Conservation Programme, initiated in 1997. There were no successful births in these seven years due to challenges such as two outbreaks of canine distemper that nearly decimated the captive red panda population,” the park’s Director, Sangay Gyatso, said. Canine distemper is a highly contagious, potentially fatal viral disease that affects the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems of dogs and other carnivores. Mr Gyatso said the park’s red panda (Ailurus fulgens) breeding programme began with Preeti, a female from Rotterdam Zoo in the Netherlands and Jugal from Darjeeling’s Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park. “Their successful breeding laid the foundation for a thriving genetic lineage. In 2005, the programme was further strengthened with the inclusion of a wild-origin pair, Lucky and Ram, helping expand and diversify the genetic pool,” he said. All red pandas born under this programme are tracked through national and international studbooks to ensure healthy genetic variability and global breeding cooperation, the park authorities stated. Red pandas typically breed in the winter months between November and January. After a gestation period of about five months, females give birth between June and August in warm, hidden nests.

President Asif Ali Zardari approved the appointment on the advice of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif,Geo Newsreported, citing an official statement. The development came hours after the President signed into law the controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment, which provides for the creation of the FCC.

The oath-taking ceremony is scheduled for Friday at the Presidency, where the Chief Justices and judges of superior courts, along with senior government officials, have been invited to attend, the report said. The amended legislation mandates the establishment of the FCC to deal with matters related to the Constitution, while the existing Supreme Court would deal only with traditional civil and criminal cases. One of the Supreme Court's key powers, taking suo motu notices, has also been transferred to the FCC, which has been empowered to take suo motu notice upon petitions.

1056,2025,The Hindu,1056,"NIA nabs suspected mastermind behind Iran-based organ trade in Kerala The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has arrested the key accused in a case registered in connection with the alleged trafficking of people to Iran for illegal organ donation. The arrested person has been identified as Madhu Jayakumar, a resident of Ernakulam in Kerala. He was reportedly apprehended on his arrival from Iran on November 8. Produced before a court in Kochi, Madhu has since been remanded in NIA custody till November 19 and is currently being interrogated by NIA officials. He is suspected to be the mastermind allegedly controlling organ-trafficking operations in Iran in coordination with hospitals there. The international racket was first exposed in May 2024 when a Thrissur native was intercepted at the Kochi airport by the Bureau of Immigration on his arrival from Iran via Kuwait. The arrested person was identified as Sabith Nasar, 30, of Edamuttam. He was handed over to the Ernakulam Rural police, who registered his arrest for suspected links with an international network engaged in human organ trade and trafficking. Sabith reportedly convinced victims that it was legal to donate organs in exchange for money and took them abroad for kidney transplants between January 2019 and May 2024. He is believed to have taken around 20 persons from India — mostly from North India – as donors and recipients for kidney transplantation at a hospital in Iran. Following this, the Ernakulam Rural police formed a special investigation team, before the NIA took over the probe. In August 2024, the NIA filed a chargesheet against four accused in the case. According to the agency, the racket was allegedly operating under the guise of medical tourism. While three of the accused – Sabith, Sajith Shyam, and Bellamkonda Ram Prasad – had already been arrested, Madhu had been absconding. In February 2025, an Interpol Red Corner Notice was issued against him while he was residing in Iran. All four accused have been charged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

Washington is Taipei’s biggest arms supplier and a key deterrent to a potential Chinese attack, but Mr. Trump’s remarks on Taiwan have raised doubts about his willingness to defend the democratic island. Beijing claims Taiwan is part of its territory and has threatened to use force to bring it under its control. “This marks the first time the new Trump administration has announced an arms sale to Taiwan,” the Foreign Ministry said, after the U.S. State Department approved the package. Taiwan requested “non-standard components, spare and repair parts, consumables and accessories, and repair and return support for F-16, C-130, and Indigenous Defense Fighter (IDF) aircraft,” a statement posted on the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency said. Taiwan has its own defence industry, but the island’s military would be massively outgunned in a conflict with China and remains heavily reliant on U.S. weapons for self-defence. While the United States is legally bound to provide arms to Taiwan, Washington has long maintained “strategic ambiguity” when it comes to whether it would deploy its military to defend the island from a Chinese attack. Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te has been at pains to find favour with Mr. Trump, vowing to raise defence spending to more than 3% of GDP next year and 5% by 2030. Mr. Lai has also pledged to boost investment in the United States as his government tries to reduce Mr. Trump’s 20% tariff on Taiwanese exports. But his government’s plans for a special defence budget of up to NT$1 trillion (US$32 billion) could be derailed by the main opposition Kuomintang party, which controls the parliament with the help of the Taiwan People’s Party.

The proposal, which seeks diversion of about 57 hectares of forest land to convert old Taungya settlements into revenue villages, was considered by the Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) of the environment ministry at its meeting held on September 26. Officials from the Sikkim Rural Development Department told the committee that the move was aimed at securing the rights and livelihoods of Taungyadars families who for generations worked with the forest department, planting trees, tending to plantations and protecting forests long before the Forest Conservation Act came into force in 1980. The Taungyadari, or Taungya, system was a traditional forest management practice dating back to the pre-merger era when Sikkim was a monarchy. Under this system, families were allotted small forest patches to plant and care for tree saplings for three years. In return, they were allowed to cultivate food crops on part of the land and received a small subsidy or daily wages for their labour. These Taungyadars lived in forest fringes, growing crops, rearing cattle and guarding the forests from fires and illegal felling. Records show that each family was given around six acres, two for tree planting every year and two for homestead use. Initially, they were paid a ""Taungya subsidy"" of Rs 200, later increased to Rs 500, and were employed on daily wages in plantation work, timber cutting and firewood stacking. According to documents presented to the committee, several of these old Taungya settlements still exist in areas such as Yali Reserve Forest in Gangtok, Tumlabong in Singtam and Karthok in Pakyong, as well as Melli Compound, Majhitar, Rayong and Jholungey Reserve Forests.

A Bench comprising Justices Dipankar Datta and Augustine George Masih gave petitioners liberty to approach the waqf tribunal concerned. The Centre had launched the Unified Waqf Management, Empowerment, Efficiency and Development (UMEED) portalon June 6 to create a digital inventoryafter geo-tagging all waqf properties. According to the mandate of the UMEED portal, details of all registered waqf properties across India are to be mandatorily uploaded within six months. The petitioners argued that the portal was faulty and was not recording details when uploaded. They said the deadline was coming to a close on December 6, and there would be a huge loss of property unless the Supreme Court intervened. The Bench said it cannot re-write Section 3B(1) of the Unified Waqf Management, Empowerment, Efficiency and Development Act, 1995 by extending the time of uploading the details of waqfs by another six months. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal sought liberty to file an application in future in the Supreme Court if the process ran into a hiccup again.

1077,2025,The Hindu,1077,"The silent transmission gap: why babies still get HIV even when mothers test negativePremium Mother to child transmission of HIV remains one of the major challenges in the effort to eliminate HIV in children. HIV can pass from a mother to her baby during pregnancy, during delivery or through breastfeeding. Over the years, early antenatal HIV testing, treatment for pregnant women living with HIV and medicines for newborns have reduced transmission rates across many regions. However, an important concern continues to appear in clinical practice. Some babies are still diagnosed with HIV even though their mothers tested negative during pregnancy. This worrying pattern, often called the silent transmission gap, highlights key gaps in testing, timing and follow-up care. Many women test negative in early pregnancy, but may acquire HIV later. If a person becomes newly infected during pregnancy, her viral load is often very high, which greatly increases the chance of passing the virus to the baby. A single test at the start of pregnancy may therefore miss new infections that happen later. After a new infection, there is a also a ‘window period’ -- an interval of time during which standard screening tests may not detect HIV even though the virus is present. During this time, the chance of transmitting HIV is high. This means a pregnant woman may test negative despite recently acquiring the infection. Usually, only one HIV test is recommended during the early stages of pregnancy. Hence, without repeated testing in the later stages of pregnancy and during breastfeeding, some new infections have a high chance of being undetected. This creates a missed opportunity for early treatment and prevention. The risk of transmission is especially high if the mother acquires HIV during late pregnancy, delivery or the breastfeeding period. Transmission can happen before birth, during birth or after birth through breast milk. To close this silent gap, the following steps are important: For pregnant women:Repeat HIV testing in the later months of pregnancy, testing again at the time ",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/the-silent-transmission-gap-why-babies-still-get-hiv-even-when-mothers-test-negative/article70344253.ece

In an interview a few years ago, the sitar exponent had shared how as a young boy he was told to play both for himself and his father. Apart from this, when he emerged on stage in the early 1970s, he had to compete with sitarists from his own family such as Ustad Vilayat Khan, Ustad Imrat Khan and Ustad Rais Khan. Then there were also other greats such as Pt. Ravi Shankar, Pt. Nikhil Bannerji and Ustad Abdul Halim Jaffer Khan.

These strips are pasted over the cheekbone and reduce the glare created by light reflected off the skin by more than half. They were popularised in the previous decade by West Indies cricketer Shivnarine Chanderpaul. It’s a simple solution to a problemposed by the pink ball, which has a black seam that ‘extra’ light could make difficult to pick under floodlights. The strips are also a reminder that modern sport is full of unobtrusive technologies that help athletes cope with difficult environments without turning them into different kinds of athletes. These tools are often aimed at restoring something that environmental conditions take away, including clear vision under bright lights, stable joints under heavy load or basic safety in high-speed collisions – but some of them also sit in a grey area between ordinary equipment and performance enhancement, raising questions about where sport should draw the line. In American football and baseball, eye-blacks and tinted helmet visors help players keep track of the ball under floodlights while also protecting their eyes. Basketball and football players use compression sleeves and kinesiology tape to support muscles and joints when they have a packed match schedule. Long-distance runners and footballers wear custom orthotic insoles to correct gait and reduce contact forces, seemingly without changing what their legs can do in principle. Swimmers bank on specialised goggles to see clearly and maintain direction in turbulent water. Tennis players have long moved away from wooden and towards composite racquets that are standardised but still vary in subtle ways that can enhance control or mitigate strain. In each case, sport has accepted equipment that offsets some nuisance while usually resisting technologies that would add new capacities.

The Youth Tipra Federation (YTF), which had been preparing for the event as a “show of strength” across the State, has not yet responded to the decision. In a letter to the YTF, the Sub-Divisional Police Officer (SDPO) of Sadar (Agartala) stated that half of the venue, Vivekananda Mini Stadium, is currently occupied by an International Expo, and that permitting the rally in the remaining space could result in severe congestion. The letter further noted that “a situation like a stampede may occur if a mass rally takes place,” with the added risk of damage to property associated with the Expo. The denial of permission, it said, was made in the interest of public safety, particularly to prevent harm to “men, women and children,” and to avoid a “chaotic situation.” Sources said intelligence inputs from multiple agencies and on-ground assessments by the State police prompted senior officials to take the decision. Recent incidents of violence in Takarjala, Jampuijala, Sidhai, Khowai, and Santirbazar,  allegedly involving Tipra Motha supporters, were also reviewed at the highest levels of government before the order was issued.

A Bench of Justice Praveen Kumar Giri in its order passed on November 21 cited an order of the Andhra Pradesh High Court which said that caste-based discrimination does not exist within the Christian faith, and therefore the basis for Scheduled Caste classification stands nullified upon conversion, irrespective of the existence of any previously issued caste certificate. The Bench also cited a Supreme Court order which observed that claiming caste-based benefits merely for the purpose of availing reservation after conversion amounts to a “fraud on the Constitution.” The court dismissed the plea filed by Jitendra Sahani who has been accused of promoting enmity between two religions and outraging the religious feelings of a particular community. In his plea, Mr. Sahani stated that he merely sought permission to organise a gathering on his own land to “preach the words of Jesus Christ” but police falsely implicated him in the case. The police, however, told the court that the applicant, who belonged to the Kewat community, had stated his religion to be Hinduism in his affidavit but had actually converted to Christianity. One of the witnesses, quoted by the police in the chargesheet, submitted that Mr. Sahani used to allure poor people to convert to Christianity. The witness further alleged that the accused used filthy, abusive and absurd language about Hindu deities.

He urged them to treat their training period as a golden opportunity to learn, observe and build a strong professional foundation. District training must focus on acquiring the ability to address real-life issues swiftly and satisfactorily. As first responders, the police carry the responsibility of earning the victim’s trust through their promptness, conduct and priorities,” an official statement said. Mr. Adityanath advised the trainees to gain a deep understanding of police station functioning, administration, investigation processes, duty management and local disputes. Calling the police station the “backbone of policing,” he stressed that human intelligence remains the most powerful tool for any officer. Interaction with local communities, strong field presence and building trust, he added, strengthen policing at every level. The CM asked trainees to clearly understand the roles, resources and challenges of the police station, circle and police line, and said effective synergy between these three levels enhances the district’s security apparatus. “When dealing with public representatives, interactions must be dignified and responsible.

The agency’s suggestions, communicated to the government by Director, VACB, Manoj Abraham, last week, came in the wake of “Operation Blackboard”, which targeted District Educational Offices (41), Regional Deputy Director Offices (7) and Assistant Director Offices of the Vocational Higher Secondary Education Wing (7) in Kerala on November 11. “Operation Blackboard” had detected brazen falsification of student admissions and attendance registers in aided schools to retain existing teaching posts and create new ones, in return for sizeable backhanders from job applicants and hefty commissions for corrupt officials in district educational offices. The VACB also unearthed serious violations of the statutory reservation norms prescribed under the Rights of Persons With Disabilities Act, 2016. The agency insisted that aided-school managements publish information on appointments in the disability category for official scrutiny, to ensure compliance with the law. The VACB also recommended that the government use the Samanwaya Portal to track school appointments in real time to detect any anomalies. It also asked the government to insist that the aided school managements publish online, on the sixth working day of every academic year, the details of students with addresses, the total student strength, the number of sanctioned divisions, and sanctioned staff strength. Moreover, management should file the information as an affidavit with the local VACB office to pre-empt manipulation. The VACB recommended the creation of an independent team of competent General Education officials, recommended by the District Collector, to verify the number of students, which is the baseline relied upon by aided managements to fix the staff strength, or justify their demand for new posts.",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vacb-recommends-kerala-psc-to-conduct-aided-school-appointments-to-stop-corruption/article70341124.ece

Two vessels sank in the rough seas, a fishing boat in Khanh Hoa province and a smaller raft in Lam Dong, according to the environment ministry. It said a total of three people were killed and authorities were still searching for a fourth. Koto was more than 300 kilometres (185 miles) offshore Sunday morning, having been downgraded from a typhoon to a tropical storm. Vietnam's weather bureau said it was moving slowly and expected to weaken further before colliding with the coast next week. It forecast rains of up to 150 millimetres (six inches) on Tuesday and Wednesday from Hue to Khanh Hoa — regions that have only just recovered from historic floods. Vietnam is in one of the most active tropical cyclone regions on Earth and is typically affected by 10 typhoons or storms a year, but Koto is the 15th of 2025. Natural disasters have left more than 400 people dead or missing this year in Vietnam and caused more than $3 billion in damage, according to the national statistics office.

A Bench headed by the Chief Justice of India B.R. Gavai directed States to pay out an ex-gratia amount of ₹10 lakh to victims of human-wildlife conflicts under the Centrally Sponsored Umbrella Scheme of Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats. “All States should have smooth and inclusive compensation policies for crop damage, loss of life of both human and cattle. In order to reduce the timelines to mitigate the issues resulting out of human-wildlife conflict, close coordination between different agencies and departments with mandated responsibilities should be ensured,” the Supreme Court ordered. The court was hearing a petition alleging illegal tree-felling and construction in the Corbett Tiger Reserve, one of the oldest in the country. The judgment made the State of Uttarakhand fully liable to restore and repair the Corbett ecology. The State, in consultation with the Central Empowered Committee, was directed to submit a restoration plan for the reserve in two months, begin demolishing illegal constructions there in three months, and file a compliance affidavit in the apex court in a year. The judgment, authored by Chief Justice Gavai, directed States to notify buffer and core areas of their tiger reserves within the next six months. The court further ordered States to prepare a Tiger Conservation Plan within three months. Chief Justice Gavai, speaking for the court in his judgment, held that eco-sensitive zones (ESZs) should not be restricted to merely sanctuaries and national parks, and must include the buffer and peripheral areas of tiger reserves The court, therefore, directed States to notify ESZs around their tiger reserves, including buffer and fringe areas, within a year from this judgment.

Please inform the other accused as well.” Mr. Dave agreed to convey the instruction. The court on Wednesday could not hear arguments on behalf of the accused owing to paucity of time. The judges expressed concern over the extended proceedings, observing that arguments on bail petitions ought to be concluded with greater promptness. “The bail pleas are being argued as if they were a second appeal. Fresh arguments are being made,” Justice Kumar remarked. The Bench has been hearing the bail petitions for over a month. The accused have challenged the Delhi High Court’s September 2 order denying them bail. The High Court had described their roles as “prima facie grave,” observing that the material on record suggested a coordinated plan behind the riots, which left 53 people dead and hundreds injured.

This marks Ms. Banerjee's second phase of anti-SIR mobilisation after her Bongaon rallylast week in the refugee-dominated Matua belt, where she alleged the revision drive was being misused to intimidate borderland families. The TMC is positioning her district-wise campaign as a counter to the BJP's ""infiltrator-cleansing"" narrative. The TMC leaders said the decision to hold consecutive rallies in Malda, Murshidabad on December 3, 4 and Cooch Behar on December 9, in three politically sensitive border districts with sizeable minority, migrant and displaced populations, signals a deliberate attempt to reclaim the narrative ahead of 2026, especially as the SIR exercise fuels unease over scrutiny of documents, identity and citizenship. The Malda rally is scheduled at Gajole and Murshidabad's at Beharampore stadium. The Cooch Behar rally, scheduled for December 9 at the historic Rash Mela Maidan, is being projected as Banerjee's biggest mobilisation in the north this winter. District leaders expect a large turnout from Dinhata, Sitai, Sitalkuchi and Mekhliganj, where the SIR has triggered fear among poor rural households. Announcing preparations, district TMC president Abhijit De Bhowmik said an emergency meeting with block presidents will be held on December 1, followed by a district-level preparatory session at Rabindra Bhavan on December 2, with ministers, MPs, MLAs, councillors and panchayat functionaries finalising mobilisation plans for the chief minister's visit.

The hospital staff said that many such patients were admitted with attendants claiming to have found them abandoned on the streets. While the medical team ensures immediate stabilisation and treatment, the challenge intensifies once the patients recover, as securing space in NGO-run old age homes was becoming increasingly difficult. According to the TECC authorities, nearly 60 abandoned senior citizens have been shifted to shelters and old-age care facilities since January. The actual number, they caution, may be far higher, as families increasingly push the responsibility of caregiving onto the public healthcare system. The medical staff said, “This trend reflects growing social neglect and the urgent need for stronger support structures for vulnerable senior citizens.” On November 25, a 61-year-old man was brought in an unconscious condition by a woman who claimed she had picked him up from an NGO. He was later diagnosed with pancytopenia - a serious condition characterised by reduced counts of all major blood cells. “After stabilisation, he is able to walk and communicate. But when we contacted the phone number given during the admission, the woman denied any relationship with him. However, the patient insists she is a family member,” said a hospital staffer. The Hindualso contacted the woman but she refused to accept she was related to the patient. Asima Banu, special officer (in charge) of TECC, said the staff routinely encounter such cases of abandonment. “We have seen over 60 such patients this year.

For songwriter and guitarist Ace, drummer Rohit Oommen, and bassist Anirudh Varma, their raw, aggressive sound is the vehicle for a core mission: inspiring original thought and absolute individual freedom in a world that pressurises people to conform. Bengaluru-based Abhimanyu Prakash who is known by his stage name Ace, pursues a private teaching career to support himself as an independent artiste, while Anirudh Varma who hails from Kozhikode is a sound engineer. Rohit, who is also from Bengaluru, has a finance background; all three are 26 years old. The roots of the band begin with the friendship between Ace and Rohit. “Rohit and I were schoolmates, we would jam in my garage when we were in the 11th grade,” says Ace. This early synergy was the spark, with some of the songs performed by the band today having been conceived during those initial high school jams. Ace’s journey, however, included a period playing in a band in Germany called The Love of Dog, an experience that honed his skills but left him searching for the perfect collective energy back home. The final piece was Anirudh, a certified sound engineer whose technical background proved invaluable. When they met, Anirudh instantly understood the weight of the band’s mission, and says, “This is the journey I’ve always wanted to be on.” Despite balancing the band with demanding professional careers, their commitment is absolute. Rohit is brutally honest when he says his day job is merely “to fund this passion”, a journey he describes as “hard, fulfilling and time consuming.” While Spade Pirates’ musical engine is primarily grunge, their philosophy, is pure, unadulterated punk. Ace points to Nirvana as the sound that “got me thinking of starting a band,” recognising the foundational link between grunge and punk’s independent spirit.

According to PUCL, Darshan was picked up around 1:30 a.m. on November 12, 2025, by two policemen accusing him of showing a knife to a food-delivery personnel. When Darshan’s mother, Adilakshmi, and brother questioned the officers, they were allegedly told he was a “rowdy” and taken to the station for questioning. PUCL’s report alleged that Darshan was detained illegally for four days, and brutally assaulted with lathis and pipes inside the police station. Despite repeated visits by his mother on November 13, officers allegedly refused to release him. On November 16, police personnel allegedly forced the family to send Darshan to a private rehabilitation centre in Adakamaranahalli, claiming he needed alcohol de-addiction treatment. At the rehab facility, Darshan reportedly could not walk without support, and the staff were instructed by police to falsely state that he “fell from a bike”. Darshan remained at the centre for over a week. On November 26, his family received a call informing them that he had developed breathing complications and died.

Addressing media persons in Mysuru on August 7, BJP Mysuru district president and former MLA L. Nagendra and senior party functionary M.A. Mohan accused Congress of spreading misinformation, distorting history, and attempting to divert public attention from its failures in governance. Responding to the claims by Congress spokesperson M. Lakshman that about 1.45 lakh votes that ideally should have gone to the Congress, was ‘diverted’ to the BJP, Mr. Nagendra said such statements are without basis, and are misleading. “Mr. Lakshman should realise that he got far more votes in this parliamentary election than in any previous contest where he was repeatedly defeated. If votes were truly stolen, how did he manage to lead in the N.R. Assembly constituency? Why no complaints there?’’ The BJP accused the Congress of playing a fraud on voters by trying to bribe them, and yet was defeated. Mr. Nagendra said the Lok Sabha elections were free and fair, and people voted for BJP candidate Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar given his calibre and the contribution of the Wadiyars of Mysuru to Karnataka. “People have made their choice. Creating confusion now is irresponsible,” he added. On Mr. Lakshman’s allegation of ‘missing votes’, Mr. Mohan said, “Even Congress workers don’t see him as a deserving candidate. Let him introspect instead of blaming EVMs or the BJP, and also answer how the Congress won 136 seats in the 2023 Assembly elections,” said Mr. Mohan.

Whilehis allegations in an earlier press conference, onelectoral roll inconsistencies in the Mahadevapura constituencyin Karnataka, did not really add up to the definite existence of a ploy to aid a particular party, his accusations on Aland are a smoking gun — that attempts were made at manipulation, to the Congress’s disadvantage, in a close contest with the Bharatiya Janata Party. The Aland findings, brought out first inan investigative report inThe Hinduearlier this month, did not pertain to any actual effect on the elections. This is because the ECI did manage to stop the fraudulent deletion of nearly 6,000 voters after miscreants filed Form-7 applications designed to remove the names of legitimate voters.

The ECI’s reaction is puzzling — it acknowledges that fraudulent attempts to delete voter names were made and that it had shared details with the police investigating the case, but it does not address the core allegation about not responding to the CID’s repeated requests for “destination IP and destination port” data, which are necessary to pinpoint device data and, in turn, the identity and location of the fraudsters.

By developing optimisation models that balance carbon reduction with affordability, their work aims to make India’s transition to solar and wind energy both reliable and practical. Their models not only forecast solar or wind power generation, but they also balance multiple objectives at once such as accuracy, cost, and reliability, helping grid operators make fairer, more transparent decisions in real time. Aswin Kannan, assistant professor, IIIT-B, who led the research, along with his students, have worked on datasets from Germany (Netztransparenz, SMARD), the United States of America (NREL), and India, linking weather variables such as irradiance, temperature, and pressure to real power-output data. From multiple research papers, the team found that accuracy alone is not enough. “In energy markets, over-predicting reduces reliability, while under-predicting increases operational costs. We also found that bias in data can quietly distort results. By combining optimisation with learning, we can detect these biases and build forecasts that balance cost, reliability, and fairness for real-time grid operations,” Prof. Kannan explained. While much of his early work was in Europe, Prof. Kannan says India presents a far more dynamic challenge. “India’s renewable data quality is actually very good, sometimes better than Europe, but its variability is much higher,” he said, pointing out that unlike Germany’s uniform weather, India’s solar and wind conditions vary drastically across States and seasons.

The BAF also urged the State to update the “archaic” Karnataka Apartment Ownership Act, 1972 to end the administrative chaos and litigation caused by the lack of clear management and ownership rights. Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, Satish Mallya, president of BAF, said: “Implementing a comprehensive legal framework for apartment owners has been BAF’s primary demand for years, a commitment both the Congress and the BJP included in their manifestos. With two-and-a-half years having elapsed since the Congress took power, this is no longer a mere request, but an urgent legislative demand. The delay, the legal vacuum, and the lack of clarity have severely impacted lakhs of homeowners who deserve protection.” Some of the key provisions under KAOMA are a clear transfer of property rights and undivided share (UDS) from builders/promoters to owners, strengthening owners’ associations with clear formation rules, registration mechanisms, and enforcement power for bylaws, establishing a dedicated, clear, and swift mechanism for resolving conflicts, including provisions for amalgamation and redevelopment to manage ageing apartment complexes effectively, and a consolidating governance under one powerful Act (KAOMA) instead of relying on fragmented, multiple laws, according to the release.",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bangalore-apartments-federation-urges-for-tabling-kaoma-in-the-upcoming-belagavi-session-of-legislature/article70349663.ece

Poised, focused, and confident despite her youth, Diya is all set to make her mark in the music industry with her song ‘Tell Me’ that questions the idea of being loved and seen in a world that embraces facades. “The 12-year-old me would be screaming right now,” says the singer, talking about her musical journey. As a child, Diya grew up in a home filled with music and shared memories of her grandmother playing the veena every morning and her mother recording performances with a handycam. Songwriting came naturally to her and quite early on in her childhood, says Diya, adding that the lyrics reflected the different stages of her life. As a child, her songs were simple, usually revolving around friendships or her mother, and eventually moved on to themes of love, romance and relationships. Diya began learning music in the sixth grade which provided her with a solid vocal training; she also learnt to play the guitar. She joined Moksha 360 in 2024 to actively pursue her passion in the music industry. “The inspiration for ‘Tell Me’came from a sudden urge to write. I would keep humming, to try and find the melody I wanted,” the 19-year-old says, adding much of the credit of the song’s success goes to her mentor and music composer Richard A Dudley. Richard Dudley, founder of Moksha 360, talks about the importance of expression within music, humorously recalling how most young artistes come to him with songs about love, “in the beginning it’s about a guy that gave them butterflies and six months later, it’s about how he broke her heart.” Talking about Diya’s debut single, Richard says he is glad the song resonates with people and their emotional experiences. ‘Tell Me’ comes from a vulnerable space of personal experiences and crafting this song “gave me a new and exciting feeling”, ",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/bengaluru-based-singer-diya-yadalam-on-her-debut-single-tell-me/article70330875.ece

The device was discovered on Sunday during surprise inspections. Following the recovery, Paramesh H.A., Superintendent of the Central Prison, filed a complaint with the jurisdictional police seeking a detailed investigation.

Sources in the Prisons Department suspect a deep-rooted nexus between certain prison staff and inmates, which may have facilitated the smuggling of the contraband.

The case relates to an attempt to remove electors by forging Form 7, ahead of theAssembly election in 2023, and has gone cold since the ECI is yet to share crucial data needed to nab the accused. Thecase came to light in February 2023, when senior Congress leader and then Aland candidate B.R.

He quickly lodged a complaint with the ECI. “One of the Booth Level Officers [BLOs] received a Form 7 application to delete her brother’s vote, when he had not even applied. Her brother was my supporter. The application was made in the name of another voter in the same village, who was also not aware of it.

Justice S. Sunil Dutt Yadav passed the order while rejecting the petitions filed by K. Kiran (accused- 2), Vimal Raj B. (accused-3), Pradeep (accused-6), Madan R. (accused-7), and V. Samuel (accused-8). They are accused in the murder of Shivaprakash alias Bikla Shiva, who was killed on July 15. The trial court had extended the period for submitting final investigation report as the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), which is probing the case, invoked the provisions of the Karnataka Control of Organized Crime Act (KCOCA) against all the accused, including the MLA. KCOCA enables the investigating agency to seek additional 90 days for submitting the final investigation report. While rejecting the contention that the public prosecutor had failed to annex the report of the investigating officer while filing his report to the trial court seeking extension of time to submit final probe report, the High Court said that “absence of annexing the report of the investigating officer would not denude the legal value to be attached to the report of the public prosecutor.” The High Court also found that the public prosecutor’s report contained the requirements of the KCOCA, that it should contain progress of investigation and specific reason for extension of detention of the accused beyond 90 days.",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/karnataka-high-court-finds-no-procedural-lapses-in-extending-time-to-submit-chargesheet-in-murder-case-in-which-mla-basavaraj-is-accused/article70349471.ece

On Sunday morning, over 40 citizens, officials and local residents set out on a five-km footpath walk to see whether Koramangala’s pavements were actually usable. The walk was part of the Project Walkaluru, a citizen initiative aimed at identifying and celebrating the city’s best pedestrian infrastructure. Flagged off by South Corporation Commissioner Ramesh K.N., it saw participation from Arjuna Award-winning athlete Reeth Devaiah Abraham, former Accenture chairperson Rekha Menon, among others. The group traced a five-km loop through Koramangala 3rd Block- covering Sarjapur Road, 8th Main, 80 feet road, 7th cross and 16th main road- stopping to count obstacles that forced them off the footpath. Before the walk began, the participants guessed they would face 15 to 25 such hurdles. In the end, they found only about eight to 10 obstacles. There were no garbage piles, no broken slabs, and no two-wheelers parked on pavements- an unusual outcome for any Bengaluru neighbourhood. Only a few cars and construction materials blocked the path in some places. A few minor irritants such as hanging wires, cow dung and stones placed to deter vehicles were also noticed, but overall the walk remained smooth. When asked to rate the experience, most of the participants gave it a thumbs up. The first walk under the Project Walkaluru, an 11-km Rajyotsava footpath walk, was held in Shivajinagar on November 1.

The passengers claim these counterfeit apps look identical to official interfaces of popular cab and auto aggregators, allowing drivers to manually alter fares and present inflated bills at the end of trips. Punith K., a resident of Yelahanka, recounted his experience after booking an auto through a cab aggregator from Kempegowda International Airport Terminal 2 to Yelahanka. “The fare shown on my app was ₹700. Everything went as usual. I entered the OTP and the ride started normally. But at the end of the trip, the driver showed me a billing screen on his phone that displayed ₹950. It looked exactly like the aggregator app interface which I was using, but something seemed off,” he said. Mr. Punith became suspicious when his own app continued to show that the ride was not yet completed. “When I insisted on checking, the driver hesitated. After pressing him, I realised he was using a fake app. It looked exactly like the app I was using, same design, same buttons but the fare could be edited manually,” he added. Another commuter, Abhilash P. from J.P.

Firstly, it is intended to mitigate the risk of flooding, which the city increasingly faces with each passing monsoon. Secondly, it is necessary to reiterate the grave concerns surrounding air pollution and Air Quality Index (AQI) levels, reduction of which forms a central part of the rationale behind the eco park.” Stating air pollution was not merely an environmental issue anymore, the judges agreed with senior counsel P. Wilson, representing Tamil Nadu government, that it had become a public health emergency. “The experience of the citizens of Delhi in the recent past is a stark reminder, where escalating AQI levels have led to lockdowns, closure of schools, disruption of public life, and severe health impacts,” the Bench said.

Jayaraman said that when a single contractor handles multiple roads across Tiruvottiyur, Sholinganallur, and Ambattur, attention to individual areas suffers. “Contractors with connections to the ruling party often dodge responsibilities, ignore residents and local authorities, and compromise on quality. In my ward, relaying roads took over eight months even after the tender was finalised, yet the resurfaced roads had to be redone because the work was uneven and substandard,” he said. “The large package system, introduced during the AIADMK government, saw many issues and gaps in road relaying for many months across the city. To curb the problems, the DMK had promised in its 2021 Assembly election manifesto to revert to a zone-wise tendering process, but this commitment has not been fulfilled,” he added.

The interactions between land, ocean and atmosphere changes contribute to cloud dynamics in a complex manner. Our understanding of the internal dynamics of tropical cyclones is not complete,” she said. Meteorologists noted that forecasting such behaviour in the tropics is challenging, especially since weather models have limitations. Sometimes, weather models cannot predict when weather systems’ movement stalls. Y.E.A. Raj, former Deputy Director of Meteorology, Chennai, said cyclone Ditwah was a marginal cyclone with wind speeds reaching up to 40 knots. The remarkable slowdown of the system was unexpected and movement was slow at 2-3 kmph. Typically, depressions or cyclones slow down before recurving. This system recurved towards southwestwards instead of the usual north or east direction,  which is a rare occurence for tropical cyclones. When they move northwards, the systems would pick up speed. During the period between 1981 and 2024, only three weather systems recurved and moved towards southwest direction in November 1996, November 2013 and December 2018",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cyclone-ditwahs-unusual-stall-leads-to-prolonged-rains-in-tamil-nadu/article70349738.ece

The Centre for Nanoelectronics and VLSI Design (CNVD) at VIT, Chennai, has designed and developed a Mixed-Signal Readout Interface (RoI) chip which can integrate into portable medical devices for self-diagnostic application. The fabricated chip was formally handed over to VIT Chennai by Union Minister for Electronics and Information Technology Ashwini Vaishnaw at a function at the Semiconductor Laboratory, Mohali, held recently. The chip integrates both analog and digital circuits to exploit the advantages of both the designs, thereby efficiently picking up and processing the physical parameters of the user through a range of Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) sensors for healthcare applications including: heart rate, blood pressure and other similar cardiac function measuring devices. G.V. Selvam, vice president, VIT, said that VIT Chennai places a strong and strategic emphasis on multidisciplinary research that directly contributes to societal advancement. “Our faculty and students actively collaborate to develop practical and real-world solutions to the challenges faced by communities,” he added. T. Thyagarajan, Pro Vice-Chancellor, VIT Chennai said that VIT Chennai’s stronger focus on translational research enabled the faculty team from Centre for Nanoelectronics and VLSI Design at VIT Chennai to successfully tape-out this indigenously designed chip at the Semiconductor Laboratory, Mohali, using a dual design-style approach. The designs ensure signal processing done with less footprint as well as minimal power consumption of 14% lower than the market available products.

It is perhaps not surprising that the news of his shocking and sudden death jolted so many of us in Chennai. As director of the Goethe-Institut between 2014 and 2020, he touched many lives – opening opportunities for artists, photographers, writers, musicians, environmentalists and others.

Residents in areas, such as Ganesapuram in north Chennai, have complained about flooding in the area because of an incomplete bridge project in Ganesapuram. The work in Ganesapuram has been delayed for several years. Ahead of the onset of Northeast monsoon, residents and councillors raised complaints over the delay in the construction of bridges, including Ganesapuram flyover and associated flood mitigation projects, such as box culvert across the railway tracks. Local resident Sharavana Kumar who is a business owner operating at Dr.Ambedkar College Road, Vyasarpadi, said the delay in completion of the Ganesapuram flyover has affected flood preparedness in north Chennai. “Owing to flooding of the area on Tuesday, residents had to take a circuitous route to reach various parts of the city.

Chidambaranathan, a resident of Chennai, left to Sri Lanka with his wife and daughter, looking forward to a pleasant trip. However, nature had other plans. After Cyclone Ditwah swept through the island nation and became one of the worst disasters to strike it, they endured what they described as one of the most harrowing experiences of their lives. “Everything seemed fine when we landed. Though there was some rain, we had a smooth visit to Trincomalee. After that, the trouble started when we headed to Nuwara Eliya. It turned out to be a very distressing trip. It feels surreal that we have all managed to return safely,” he recounted. Mr. Chidambaranathan and his family were among the 24 people who were stranded in Sri Lanka and returned to Chennai on Tuesday morning by a Sri Lankan Airlines flight.

The second such order in a month has left doctors apprehensive that this ongoing practice could increase their work burden and impact patient care, rather than addressing their long-term demand for new posts in line with the rising patient load. Earlier this year, the Health Minister announced in the Assembly that 500 postgraduate seats would be created in 13 government medical colleges and Kalaignar Centenary Super Speciality Hospital. Following this, the Director of Medical Education and Research submitted a proposal seeking sanction of human resources for starting the new courses. A total of 380 posts were proposed based on the number of teaching faculty required as per National Medical Commission (NMC)/Post Graduate Medical Education Board norms — 31 each for the government medical colleges in Virudhunagar, The Nilgiris, Dindigul, Ariyalur, Kallakurichi, Krishnagiri, Nagapattinam, Tiruppur, Tiruvallur, Namakkal and Karur, seven for Ramanathapuram, and 32 for Pudukottai. These posts, included associate professor, assistant professor and senior resident positions. However, this was being carried out by surrendering 392 posts identified as surplus at these institutions under NMC guidelines. Over 90% of the surrendered posts were those of junior residents (JR), with the rest being senior resident, associate professor and professor. Earlier, in November, the government had approved 59 new posts to strengthen cancer care in 16 tertiary hospitals by surrendering an equal number of posts in various medical institutions — again, mostly JR posts.

He questioned why the Chief Minister, who recently made remarks about “lady dons” during a political meeting in Nellore for political mileage, has not spoken a single word about Penchalayya’s sacrifice in fighting the drug mafia. Penchalayya represented the voice of society against ganja and narcotics, he said. Mr. Srinivas Rao also criticised the coalition government for privatising education and healthcare. According to him, the recent directives reveal that while the titles of ten medical colleges remain with the government, their management is handed to private companies, effectively giving public resources to private entities. He highlighted that under the PPP model, seats that were previously merit-based now require payments ranging from ₹8 lakh to ₹12 lakh, making it difficult for poor students to access quality education.

The YSRCP did not spare Union Finance Minister Nirmala  Sitharaman from its mischievous campaign during the laying of foundation for regional offices of 15 banks in Amaravati, he said, cautioning it (YSRCP) of the consequences of playing with the people’s sentiments. Addressing the media at the TDP central office, near Mangalagiri, on Wednesday, Mr. Umamaheswara Rao said former Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy should be mindful of the fact that his government had to beat a hasty retreat on the proposed three capitals due to the Amaravati farmers’ 1,631-day agitation, during which period 272 farmers died because of the anguish caused by his ill-advised decision to have separate capitals for administrative, judicial and executive functions in Amaravati, Kurnool and Visakhapatnam respectively. This was intended to abandon Amaravati on grounds which the YSRCP could not justify.

In a blog titled ""Five Reforms India Needs for Clean Air"", Ms. Bedi said the country must move from firefighting to systemic change. ""Fix the system and the air will follow. India deserves institutions strong enough to deliver the most basic public good: breathable air,"" she said. The former L-G said the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) needs ""leadership with real authority"". Ms. Bedi said that the commission is led by a retired official who, while experienced, lack the administrative leverage and political heft essential to move ministries and influence budgets. She wrote that ""a serving secretary-level officer can coordinate across States, bargain with chief secretaries and push execution at the speed the crisis requires"". Ms. Bedi urged integration of CAQM into the Environment Ministry, saying the body currently operates beside the ministry rather than within it.

At a secluded stretch near the Bawana-Narela belt, they intercepted, surrounded and ‘violently’ robbed the elderly man, the police said. The suspects Karan (21), Sachin (22), and Akash (24), were arrested by the police. During interrogation, they disclosed that the robbery was meticulously planned and executed with two other accomplices, Lovely (the alleged mastermind) and Mohan alias Gandhi. “Efforts are on to apprehend the two absconding accused,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police (Outer North) Hareshwar Swami. The police said the group acted in a planned and meticulous manner, and were “highly coordinated”, revealing a pattern on choosing their targets. The police said the suspects assembled after a call from Lovely, proposing a major robbery for quick money. The accused posed as customers inside the bank to identify a suitable target. After identifying the victim, two of the suspects followed him to confirm the withdrawal amount. The group then tailed him and waited for a less-crowd location to execute the robbery.

It was before her examination in 2023 and since all her documents were linked to the same phone number, she could not do away with it. “They said they knew where I live. I even stopped going out to the balcony,” she recalled. Two years on, she added, “I don’t ever want to go back to Delhi.” The phone calls and text messages started after she said something that “some men did not like” on her Instagram handle, a screenshot of which was shared widely along with her phone number and photos. “There were groups of men which would specifically target Muslim women, and I became their prey. They circulated my phone number and photos with captions like ‘call her for a good time’. I received 800-1,000 calls a day,” she said. Still reeling from the trauma, Ms. Nafisa is not alone in her struggle. From cyber stalking, doxxing (circulating private information), morphed images to rape threats and slurs, women in Delhi, particularly those from marginalised communities, said that the Internet is becoming a scarier place each day. The concerning trend, however, is not reflected in national data. The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data released recently for 2023 recorded only 36 cyber crimes against women, of which 28 were linked to publishing or transmission of sexually explicit material, and eight were in the category of other women-centric cyber crimes including blackmail, defamation, morphing and fake profiles. For the same year, Delhi surpassed all other metropolitan cities in terms of overall crimes against women, with 13,366 cases.

Later in the day, the Commission for Air Quality Management in the NCR and Adjoining Areas (CAQM) issued a statement noting a “substantial reduction” in farm fires in Punjab and Haryana — the biggest drop since the agency began monitoring State-wise crop residue management in 2018. Mr. Yadav made the remarks while responding to a question from Congress’s Jalandhar MP Charanjit Singh Channi on whether Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) crossed 450 this year despite a reported 20% reduction in farm fires in Punjab. He also sought details about the steps taken to enforce the CAQM’s directives, including subsidies for crop residue management machinery. The Minister said air pollution in Delhi-NCR is the result of several local and regional factors, including vehicular and industrial emissions, dust from construction, burning of municipal waste, landfill fires and meteorological conditions. Stubble burning in Punjab and the NCR is an additional “episodic event”, he added. Listing the measures taken to curb stubble burning, Mr. Yadav said Punjab and Haryana together received over ₹3,120 crore since 2018-19 for crop residue management machinery. More than 2.6 lakh machines have been distributed to individual farmers, and the CAQM has directed both States to ensure rent-free access to these machines for marginal farmers. ALSO WATCHWatch: What’s causing air pollution in Delhi? The Minister also said that Delhi had recorded its lowest January-November average AQI since 2018, barring the COVID-induced lockdown year of 2020.

They joined physical classes on November 26,” he added. The Minister said several leading institutes have been empanelled in the Mahamana Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya Vidya Shakti Mission for which ₹21 crore has been set aside.

Through the scheme, students will be prepared for various exams, including NEET, CLAT, and CUET. “These students are not just preparing for exams; they are preparing to transform their lives. With this mission, we are not only offering educational resources but also building the courage, confidence, and emotional strength to dream bigger,” said Mr. Sood.

The proposal referred to earlier in December 2024 seeks to double parking fees in accordance with directions from the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM). Officials noted that the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) had already doubled its parking rates last year when GRAP Stage II was imposed.

The accused has been identified as Ketan Deepak Kumar (24) of Gujarat, Sanjib Mondal (34) of West Bengal and Ravi Kumar Mishra (29) of Gurugram. According to a senior officer, the three were allegedly involved in offering non-existent foreign jobs and funnelling victims’ money through mule bank accounts. The matter came to the light after a case was registered based on a complaint from a man who had lost his job during the COVID-19 pandemic and was seeking work abroad. The complainant alleged that he received a message from a group named “FLYABROAD 6” offering lucrative placements in New Zealand. The fraudsters allegedly shared fake visa copies and fabricated registration documents to gain his trust, promising a visa eligible for a chef or cook in exchange of ₹2.80 lakh, the officer said. The complainant first transferred ₹1.80 lakh following which the accused stopped responding, the officer said.

Teams have undergone several personnel changes to their playing rosters, but have done well to hold on to their head coaches to maintain some semblance of stability. Home team FC Goa’s clash with rival Mumbai City FC will be the standout fixture from the last-four stage. Both teams share a similar philosophy in their playing style, and their respective head coaches have promised to abide by their attacking nature. Goa holds a narrow advantage among the semifinalists, having had more competitive matches under its belt due to its exploits in the AFC Champions League 2.

In the second semifinal, Punjab FC could provide a bruising challenge for East Bengal. Punjab will bring plenty of intensity and physicality to the table, hoping to disrupt East Bengal’s attacking rhythm.

The theme of the conference is “Dementia in India and Andhra Pradesh – A Growing Public Health Emergency,” will focus on strengthening India’s dementia ecosystem through awareness, research, policy, and implementation-driven action. Dementia has emerged as a public health emergency, with more than 88 lakh elderly Indians currently affected. According to the LASI-DAD 2023 study, Andhra Pradesh has a dementia prevalence of 7.7%, higher than the national average. By 2036, nearly 8 lakh people in the State are projected to be living with dementia. Dementia’s disturbing impact—rangeing from memory loss and behavioural changes to long-term dependency—deeply affecting individuals, families, and society at large. Due to widespread ignorance and stigma, almost 90% of people never receive a diagnosis. There is a need for a trained dementia workforce, community-based support, and strengthening of district mental health systems. DEMCON 2025 aims to accelerate these efforts and support the emerging State-level dementia action plan. Around 800 delegates including clinicians, researchers, policymakers, students, hospitals, old age homes, caregivers, and elder-care organisations from across India are expected to participate.

The aircraft, bearing registration number N935H, will be open for inspection until December 7, with the auction scheduled for December 9 through MSTC Limited. The proceeds will be used to compensate victims of the alleged fraud. The aircraft was seized on March 7, 2025 from Rajiv Gandhi International Airport during searches conducted under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), in connection with a case involving Amardeep Kumar, Capital Protection Force Pvt. Ltd., and others. The ED began its probe following three FIRs registered on February 11 by the Cyberabad Economic Offence Wing (EOW) against Falcon Group (Capital Protection Force Pvt. Ltd) and its CMD, Amardeep Kumar, for allegedly running a bogus invoice-discounting scheme. Investigators found that the scheme, operated under the banner ‘Falcon Invoice Discounting’, defrauded investors of ₹792 crore. According to the agency, Amardeep Kumar fled the country using the same aircraft before the FIRs were filed and remains absconding abroad. The ED has so far provisionally attached assets worth ₹18.63 crore and arrested three individuals - Amardeep’s brother Sandeep Kumar; chartered accountant Sharad Chandra Toshniwal; and Capital Protection Force Pvt. Ltd COO Aryan Singh Chhabra. A prosecution complaint was filed before the Special PMLA Court, Rangareddy, on September 29. Investigators found that the aircraft was purchased by Amardeep Kumar in 2024 for ₹1.6 million. After its seizure, the ED secured confirmation of attachment from the Adjudicating Authority on August 18. Citing high maintenance costs, the agency sought permission to sell the aircraft under Rule 4(2) of the Prevention of Money Laundering (Taking possession of attached or frozen properties) Rules, 2013.

Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw informed Parliament on Wednesday that the execution of key infrastructure projects in Telangana is being held up due to delays in acquiring approximately 764 hectares of land overall, with 1,580 hectares acquired so far. In a written reply to questions posed by Nizamabad MP Arvind Dharmapuri, the Minister stated that the Siddipet–Siricilla (31 km) stretch of the Manoharabad–Kothapalli new line is stalled because ₹10.10 crore for forest land diversion is yet to be deposited by the State government. For four other projects sanctioned on a cost-sharing basis at ₹4,704 crore, the government has not deposited ₹814 crore, which is ‘adversely affecting progress of works’, the Minister stated.

But right now, he said, people were using phones for two, two-and-a-half to three years. So, when they are upgrading, they know they need to use it for so long, so they buy a better phone, he stated. According to him, the “miscalculation” (about the smartphone market) that most people in the industry, including Xiaomi, had in 2022 was because during the pandemic in 2020 and 2021 saw unprecedented demand for smartphones as everyone was stuck in their homes. Those two years were a sort of an outlier and everyone thought that smartphones sales would keep going up, but it wasn’t’ a realistic expectation, Mr. Sarma explained. “When you look at the overall market itself, the smartphone market is not really growing much, maybe slightly, maybe de-growing in certain quarters as well. This is also because consumers are using the phone for a longer time now,’’ Mr. Sarma elaborated. Commenting on consumer trends, he said, a lot of people are sort of premiumising their choices, this trend is more evident in towns and villages. “By that, what I mean is, they are going up a level or even two in terms of their smartphone upgrades. So, someone who has probably bought maybe a phone worth ₹10,000 a couple of years back, is probably, instead of going for the next obvious choice which is a smartphone maybe in the 20K segment, they’re jumping all the way to 30k or 35k.’’ Affordability was also improving.

Hassan welcomed the Kerala High Court’s decision permitting the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to investigate the Sabarimala gold theft case. Addressing mediapersons here on Wednesday, Mr. Hassan said the ED’s involvement could lead to a more comprehensive probe. “I hope we can expect a more thorough inquiry if the ED investigates the case. The agency stepped in considering the suspected links between the Sabarimala gold theft and international idol-smuggling rackets. Once the ED begins probing, more Marxist leaders will likely end up in jail. The CPI(M)’s role in the gold heist will also come to light,” he said. Referring to CPI(M) State secretary M. V. Govindan’s remark that the ED notice in the Masala Bond case was worth no more than the paper it was printed on, Mr. Hassan said the comment only validates what the Congress leaders have been asserting. “The ED notices during the last Lok Sabha elections—particularly in the Karuvannur bank fraud case—had politically benefited the BJP. A similar attempt is happening now. In the Masala Bond case, land worth ₹466 crore was purchased in violation of norms. But the ED shows no willingness to investigate that. This is why we call it an election stunt,” Mr. Hassan pointed out. On the Rahul Mamkootathil issue, Mr. Hassan said the KPCC president had already clarified the party’s stance. “The party has taken strong action. This is the first time the KPCC has received such a complaint, and it has been forwarded to the DGP. If Mr. Mamkootathil had been within the party’s organisational structure, an internal probe would have been possible.

The latest edition of the survey, published by Cushman and Wakefield, lists Banjara Hills and Himayathnagar among 51 key retail destinations across the APAC region, placing the city in the same bracket as Tokyo, Singapore, Hong Kong and New Delhi. This report focuses on headline rents in best-in-class urban locations across the world, which, in many cases, are linked to the luxury sector. In the APAC list, Banjara Hills and Himayathnagar share the 48th position, with annual rents estimated at USD 30 per square foot (₹2,680 per sq. ft.). Their appearance in the rankings signals the steady strengthening of Hyderabad’s premium retail market, which has drawn a growing mix of national and international brands seeking to establish or expand their presence in southern India. India features prominently in the report, with several of its retail corridors registering strong year-on-year rental growth and securing places across the global tables. Among the top 50 shopping destinations worldwide, Khan Market in New Delhi remains India’s most expensive retail location, placed 24th with an annual rent of USD 223 per square foot (₹19,940 per sq ft).

Referring to a report of a Special Commissioner for Sabarimala regarding the ‘removal’ of gold coverings over the ‘Dwarapalakas’ on both sides of the sanctum sanctorum, he said that the coverings were removed in 2019, but a mahazar prepared for the same referred to them as copper sheets. As the original gold plates were replaced with gold-plated ones, they developed discolouration, necessitating immediate action to cover up the ‘theft’ committed earlier. Subsequently, it is apprehended that the plates were taken to Chennai and replaced with new ones plated with gold. This was done without seeking the High Court’s permission. In addition, it is surprising that the gold coverings needed repair within 10 years, he said, adding that the gold taken away from the temple was ‘disbursed’ in different States. Several persons and establishments from different States were involved (in this). This may hinder the effectiveness of the ongoing investigation. Therefore, a Central agency like the CBI would help with a comprehensive investigation, Mr. Chandrasekhar said in his plea.

Earlier this month, the court had asked whether the government that was committed to ensuring the rule of law and fighting corruption was protecting persons facing corruption allegations in the case, by denying sanction for a CBI probe. The court was hearing a contempt plea filed by Kadamkampally Manoj of Kollam, alleging corruption in the import of raw cashew nut by the Kerala Cashew Board and the State’s refusal to grant sanction for a CBI probe in the matter.

The directive was passed after the court heard multiple petitions on issues at the temple, mainly those pertaining to crowd management. The Board submitted that it had introduced an online booking system for darshan during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was followed by a hybrid system, having online and offline options. The temple management submitted that due to the special and unique religious customs at the temple, the timing and duration of poojas cannot be precisely predicted. It was thus decided to stop online booking for darshan and to return to only offline darshan, since the hybrid system was found not viable. Only 10 to 11 hours of darshan time are available each day, during intervals between poojas. The court observed that the issue should not be seen only as “how to manage the queue”, but fundamentally as “how to avoid the queue”, since any sudden or concentrated influx of pilgrims in the limited space leads to multiple concerns. Citing the need to introduce a modern and scientifically designed system to ensure a dignified and spiritually fulfilling experience, the court issued a dozen guidelines that ought to be considered. It directed that a scientific study must be conducted to determine the number of devotees the temple can safely accommodate on normal and festival days, and a cap fixed. Devotees may be grouped with 300 to 500 persons per group, with each group being given tentative time slots. There should also be designated entry and exit points. A mobile application and digital display system should be introduced, to provide real-time updates.

Ms. Francis was among the ten families forcibly evicted from Moolampilly in Kadamakkudy panchayat on February 6, 2008 to make way for rail and road connectivity to the Vallarpadam International Container Transshipment Terminal (ICTT). Contesting as an Independent, she finished fifth with over 3,000 votes. But it was not a battle she fought to win but to make a point, which she did. “Political parties were selling our tears to win votes. So, I thought why not front our own cause and tell people directly about our plight. We were thrown out under a British-era land acquisition law, with negligible compensation and no rehabilitation,” said Ms. Francis. She was no stranger to electoral politics, having won from the Moolampilly ward in the local body polls in 1988, one of the first women to achieve that feat. Yet, the Parliament campaign left her with a sour taste as she often felt like an outcast in a society largely indifferent to their suffering. The acquisition of land for ICTT connectivity displaced 316 families across seven villages spanning three Assembly constituencies—Kalamassery, Ernakulam, and Vypeen—and six local bodies: Kochi Corporation, Kalamassery and Eloor municipalities, and Mulavukad, Cheranalloor and Kadamakkudy panchayats. Though the Left Democratic Front government led by former Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan had notified a rehabilitation package, it is yet to be implemented in letter and spirit.

The six-day event, starting on Monday (November 17, 2025), which includes a translation workshop, is part of a University of Calcutta-led project on endangered languages, particularly Lodha and Toto, the only ones in the State to have received Central funding recently. “A translation workshop on endangered languages is a rare event in India. About 40 people from both the Lodha and Toto communities will be here for the event. The Government of India and UNESCO have placed special emphasis on their languages. This is part of our community partnership-based research, sponsored by the Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR), and the ICSSR-Eastern Regional Centre,” event convenor Mrinmoy Pramanick, founder-coordinator of the university’s Centre for Translation and Literary Geography, said. “There will also be nearly 50 people representing the Bengali language, and that’s because there are some texts that are written by the Lodha and Toto people, but in the Bengali script. We will be discussing the translation of their texts into English. Besides, there will be performances, such as a Lodha performance of their indigenous theatre form, and also an exhibition,” Prof. Pramanick said. “Our research will also be discussed with the community people for transparency and achieving better goals. We are dealing with Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTG). There are 75 PVTGs in India, and of them, three are in West Bengal.

Palestine’s official entry for the 2026 Academy Awards in the International Feature Film category,Palestine 36had three screenings at the festival, which was held from November 6 and concluded on Thursday. Directed by Annemarie Jacir, the historical drama, which portrays the 1936-1939 uprising against the British colonial rule in Palestine, explores how the lives of Palestinians profoundly altered as Jewish settlers started arriving on their shores. Though set in history, the film struck a chord with film patrons who felt it draws parallels between the British crackdown and the ongoing crisis in Gaza amid Israeli strikes. “These films help humanise what is often dehumanised by the mainstream media. They allow viewers to see Palestinians not only as victims of violence or wrongly viewed as terrorists, but as people with dreams, aspirations, humour, culture, and resilience. The act of screening such films internationally ensures that the conversation around Palestine is not abstract or distant, it is ongoing. And that it remains personal, urgent, and profoundly human,” director ofMehroon, Abu Sohel Khondekar, who was present at the screening, toldThe Hindu. “I am no film critic, but I came to see this movie so we can celebrate the voices of Palestine. I know it is about 1936, but I do not think the reality has changed even today. I think it has only got worse. It helped me understand the situation better,” said an audience member.

Two such graffiti near the ISI men’s hostel were found a dayafter the blast near the Red Fort in Delhi,in which 13 people were killed. An already existing note, 'Dogs shouldn't enter the premises' on one side of a door was prefixed with two words naming a particular community. A similar message solely targeting the community was also found on an adjacent wall. Students and researchers demanded stern action against those who wrote those hate messages. Condemning the act, ISI Director Sanghamitra Bandyopadhyay said the institute had always stood for pluralistic traditions and promoted academic and research excellence against any gender-based, religious and linguistic discrimination among its stakeholders. ""We are working to find the individual or group involved in the act. After the semester exams are over, we will take whatever remedial measures are taken including counselling of those found to be involved,"" she said.

Several documents were seized during the raid, and officials claim to have found “vital and suspicious” information, he added. During questioning, Mr. Gupta reportedly told investigators that he runs a spice trading business, and his frequent trips to Bangkok were related to that, the official said. “Mr. Gupta is also involved in foreign exchange (forex) trading, and investigators are examining whether his Bangkok visits were linked to illegal forex transactions,” the official said, adding that Mr. Gupta’s financial dealings appeared suspicious. “He might be summoned for further questioning,” the official added.

This action followed an incident in which Booth Level Officers (BLOs) protested outside the West Bengal Chief Electoral Officer’s (CEO) office in Kolkata two days earlier. During the unrest, BLOs clashed with police, broke through barricades, and entered the CEO’s office. An impasse had resulted after BLOs held a two-day protest outside the CEO’s office. The CEO was locked inside his office until around midnight as BLOs demanded an audience to make their grievances heard. “I am directed to state that it has come to the notice of the Election Commission of India that on 24.11.2025 a serious security breach has occurred at the office of the Chief Electoral Officer, West Bengal... existing security in the office of the CEO appeared to be inadequate,” the letter from Sujeet Kumar Mishra, Secretary at the ECI’s office, Delhi said.

While many of them are estranged from their biological families or were thrown out of their homes, several others who have undergone gender affirming surgery are facing uncertainty regarding their voting status. Kabita, a 24-year-old transwoman, moved out of home four years ago leaving behind years of physical violence and trauma from her own family members, who even burnt her birth certificate and other documents when she insisted on living independently. “How will I prove my identity now? My family is asking me to come home for the EC’s door-to-door verification. But I feel it’s a trap and they are using the SIR process as an excuse to call me home so they can lock me up and probably abuse me more,” she said. As part of the SIR exercise, voters are required to prove their identity, origin and, in many cases, parental legacy.

1307,2025,The Hindu,1307,"Artistes push for free open stages as poll campaigns heat up in Kozhikode As campaigns for the local body elections intensify across the district, musicians and performing artistes have revived their longstanding demand for freely accessible open stages in every local body. They argue that such public spaces, equipped with basic facilities, are essential for nurturing local talent and ensuring regular performance opportunities. Their core proposal is straightforward: each local body should develop at least one open venue where emerging artistes from the community can perform without fees or restrictions. According to them, this should be treated as a cultural priority, especially at a time when discussions on creative community development are gaining momentum. “Though we are all proud of Kozhikode’s new designation as the City of Literature, the development of dedicated public spaces for amateur performances continues to be neglected, with attention largely focused on maintaining or renovating paid facilities,” says C.V. Ansar, secretary of the Kozhikode-based collective Pattinte Koottukar. He says artistes’ groups should raise the issue collectively during the election campaign itself and work towards securing the proposal once the newly elected representatives take office. Both amateur and professional singers’ groups have endorsed the idea, calling it a basic requirement for nurturing young talent. Many feel that free public venues with uninterrupted power supply and quality sound systems would help aspiring artistes who cannot access major stage shows or television reality programmes due to financial or logistical constraints. The Kerala Ghazal Foundation in Kozhikode has demanded a more structured approach from local authorities. Its general secretary, Shabeer Rarangoth, says a special fund should be earmarked to support local artistes and their performances. “Most local events now give prominence to invited celebrity artistes, sidelining native performers.

Rajan has said. The Minister was replying to a submission raised by Thiruvambady MLA Linto Joseph in the Assembly on Wednesday. To expedite the resolution of the title deed issue in Puduppadi, a dedicated task force has been constituted including officials of the Thamarassery taluk office, Kozhikode Land Tribunal office, and the district collectorate for comprehensive data collection, a press release said. ​Steps have also been taken to speed up the process by appointing temporary surveyors and other requisite personnel, including those who have retired, on a daily remuneration basis. On the Nilamburkad area of Puthuppadi village, it was clarified that 82 occupants could secure their title deeds by affirming their tenancy rights. Based on this, the Land Tribunal office has initiated necessary procedures, and 48 title deeds have already been processed. ​Most of the land under contention where title deed issues persist in Puthuppadi village falls under Re-Survey 1/1. According to official village records, survey number 1/1 is  classified as private land covering approximately 7,700 acres originally held by 44 landlords. Roughly half of this land has subsequently been designated as vested forestland, the press release said quoting the Minister. Mr. Rajan also challenged the demand of the Forest department that the land requires the Union government’s  approval and the surrender of equivalent land for afforestation. This demand concerns land that was transferred for assignment purposes in 1978 under the Private Forest (Vesting and Assignment) Act of 1971, prior to the enactment of the Central Forest Conservation Act of 1980. Thus, this requirement was untenable, he said.

Public complaints from city and rural areas indicate that minor disputes are frequently escalating into cruel physical confrontations. One of the recent incidents at Kallummel near Valayam even involved a family travelling by a car that reportedly brushed against an SUV. Following the minor contact, a group of individuals allegedly stopped the SUV, pulled the driver and his family members from the vehicle and allegedly assaulted them. The group had reportedly over 15 people. A seven-month-old infant was also in the car who sustained a minor eye injury from a broken windshield. In another case reported a few kilometres away from the same spot, a wedding-bound family was allegedly attacked. The police had registered a case and named ten individuals as accused. Other latest incidents included the assault of a civil defence member in Naduvattam and the arrest of a private bus driver who was found driving his vehicle after using ganja. “Such incidents reflect a broader issue of declining road discipline. Factors commonly contributing to these incidents include aggression after minor collisions, crowd involvement, group retaliation and impaired driving,” says a Deputy Superintendent of Police who was associated with a number of traffic reformation activities in Kozhikode district. He points out that the lack of clarity and digital evidence on what actually led to a clash come as the biggest dilemma for police. Data available with the State Crime Records Bureau officers confirms that there has been a significant fall in the number of road accident deaths across the State.

Opening a protest meet organised on the Perambra bus stand premises in the evening, K.C. Venugopal, All-India Congress Committee general secretary in-charge of organisation, said the party would not allow police or anyone target Mr. Parambil. The attack against the Vadakara MP happened after activists of the UDF and the Left Democratic Front (LDF) workers came face to face following a ‘hartal’ called by the former in the town, which was a fallout of a students’ union election in a government college in Kozhikode. Mr. Venugopal said that the LDF, especially the CPI(M), was worried over the popularity of Mr. Parambil after his victory against party veteran K.K. Shailaja in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. He alleged that the LDF Government was trying to cover up its role in the “theft of gold plates” at the Sabarimala temple by targeting Mr. Parambil. Though senior police officials initially claimed that there had been no ‘lathi’ charge against the MP, visuals released by the media later proved them wrong. The Congress leader also said, the police personnel who led the attack would have to face consequences if the UDF comes to power in the State after the 2026 Assembly polls. Deepa Dasmunshi, AICC general secretary, said that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was answerable to what had happened to Mr. Parambil. There was tension for a while during the event after the UDF workers raised slogans against police personnel on duty on the premises. They demanded the police who could not protect Mr. Parambil the previous day need not be stationed there. Senior party leaders tried to calm them down.

Abdurahiman in the “attempt” by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] to take control of the party-controlled Karassery Service Cooperative Bank near Mukkom. DCC president K. Praveenkumar told the media here on Tuesday that Mr. Abdurahiman had “cheated” the party. “Our report to the KPCC has suggested strong action against him. Local party leaders had earlier told us that Mr. Abdurahiman was trying to sell out the bank to the CPI(M). Though Mr. Abdurahman denied the allegation in a subsequent conversation with us, we have come to know that the charge is true,” he said. The Karassery bank had been under the control of a Congress-led director board for over two decades. It is headquartered in Mukkom and has five branches and two sub-centres in Kozhikode district. Mr. Praveenkumar’s comments come a day after the bank was taken over by an administrative committee under the Department of Cooperation of the State government. It followed an audit report that highlighted gross lapses in the disbursement of loans. The Cooperation department also claimed that there had been complaints about the bank’s functioning, which turned out to be true after official inspections. However, local Congress leaders claimed that Mr. Abdurahman had created a conducive situation for the CPI(M) to take over the bank. Of the 13 directors of the bank, nine were planning to move a no-confidence motion against Mr. Abdurahman, accusing him of taking unilateral decisions without consulting the director board. Meanwhile, over 800 new ‘A’ class members were added between November 29 and November 30 after illegally using the login ID and password of the staff of the Nellikkaparamb branch.

The facility will include two operation theatres, 10 ICU beds and 20 ward beds.  Around 15 to 20 footfalls are expected per day in the OP. The dialysis unit, lab facilities and other facilities will be shared from the medical college hospital. The main institute is set to come up on the campus of the Government Hospital Of Dermatology, Chevayur. An administrative sanction was given for establishing the institute at a cost of ₹643.88 crore earlier this year. An amount of ₹14.40 crore has been sanctioned for the temporary facility, which will include purchase of equipment and civil works. The institute is expected to significantly reduce the cost involved in transplantation surgeries. “The idea is to set up a dedicated centre for all kinds of transplantations. Patients can undergo transplantation surgeries at just one-third of the cost generally charged by the private sector. It will be free for those in the Below Poverty Line (BPL) category. The idea is to make these life-saving surgeries accessible to all. A liver transplant can cost ₹30 lakh in the private sector and we could offer it to the public at ₹10 lakh. The institute will make organ transplants affordable for the common man,” an official said. Once the institute is set up, all transplants will be made possible under a single umbrella. The targeted goal after the institute has been operational for five years is to carry out 600 kidney transplants and 360 liver transplants per year. “In ten years, we want to double this.

Anaya, whose death in Augusthas been attributed to Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM), is preparing to seek legal action after an autopsy report from the Department of Forensic Medicine at Government Medical College,Kozhikode,came into the public domain. The report stated that the cause of her death was due to complications arising from viral pneumonia caused by an Influenza A infection. ​However, the Health Department has adhered to the version of PAM, and the Thamarassery police, which registered a case following a complaint from the parents that the girl was not given timely treatment, are also awaiting the chemical analysis report for more clarity. ​Anaya was treated at the Thamarassery Taluk Hospital and succumbed at the Kozhikode Medical College Hospital on  August 14.  A post-mortem was conducted the next day, and the report was forwarded to the Thamarassery police. ​Her father, Sanoop, attacked a doctor with a machete at the Thamarassery Taluk Hospital on October 8, alleging his negligence in his daughter’s death. The post mortem report, also mentions about the report of the Department of Microbiology that says that preliminary wet-mount test was suggestive of free-living amoebae. However a subsequent confirmatory analysis from the State Public Health Lab found a negative result. “Confirmatory report of the CSF (Cerebrospinal Fluid) and brain tissues revealed negative for Acanthamoeba species, Naegleria fowleri”, the report says. ​Since Naegleria fowleri is the organism that causes PAM, this negative result effectively rules out PAM as the cause of death. ​However, the Health Department is heavily relying on the confirmation given by the lab report from the Microbiology Department that Anaya’s case was PAM.

Police officers associated with the probe claimed that a volatile situation prevailed at Perambra, challenging the law and order situation in the name of a protest. It called for a comprehensive investigation which would be carried out under a senior officer, the police said. The clashes erupted following heightened political tensions after the college union election at CKG Government College, Perambra. In the elections, the Students Federation of India (SFI) secured 15 seats, while the Kerala Students’ Union and the Muslim Students Federation won five. The United Democratic Front block claimed the college chairman’s post, sparking intense protests from rival student organisations. On October 10, there was also a hartal called by the Congress in Perambra to protest against the alleged police action on Kerala Student Union (KSU) activists a day earlier. After the hartal ended at 6 p.m., both the Congress and Communist Party of India Marxist (CPIM) held protest marches that culminated near the Perambra bus stand, leading to a confrontation.

The year 2018 was when Sabarimala temple acquired a political dimension, with street protests erupting over the Supreme Court’s ruling that allowed women of all age groups to worship at the hill shrine. The verdict put the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) government on the defensive as both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) sought to rally public sentiment around the issue. The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) reaped the benefits in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Ever since, Sabarimala-related issues have become a familiar refrain on the campaign trail. The alleged misappropriation of gold from the hill temple is being highlighted by the Congress and the BJP as local body election campaigning gathers momentum. Two former presidents of the Travancore Devaswom Board, arrested in the case, are from the ruling CPI(M). Ground-level conversations in Pathanamthitta and Kottayam reveal a mixed response. Despite the noise in political circles, the issue appears to be struggling to gain political traction. Pandalam Municipality in Pathanamthitta — a BJP-ruled civic body and a major transit point to the temple, witnessed a flurry of protests led by both the Congress and the BJP. At least two major demonstrations sought to turn the alleged gold theft into a poll-season flashpoint. But voters on the ground seem far less animated. Many insist that the issue does not carry the same emotional charge or polarising effect as the 2018 agitation. “In Pandalam, the issue doesn’t hold currency beyond a point,” says G. Sreejith, a voter in Ward 8 of the municipality. “Voters are focused on the three-way fight here between the NDA, LDF, and UDF. The periodic arrests in the case have also helped dilute the momentum,” he adds. Yet not everyone is dismissive.

She reveals that a social media manager is also with her for professional assistance. Ms. Soufiya’s excitement reflects a visible loud new trend sweeping across Kerala’s local body election scene: a social media-driven campaign era exploring creativity, digital storytelling, and artificial intelligence (AI) tools.

It also decided to acquire 18 cents at Kalluthankadavu to widen the junction to facilitate the opening of a vegetable market there.

The investigators maintained that neither the Mayor nor the MLA obstructed official duty or used abusive language during the incident. The decision to exclude their names were based on legal opinion.

Meena, which was submitted to the higher authorities in May itself, he said on Sunday that despite a warning by the district collector on May 27,2024, highlighting a high risk of fire on the campus, several statutory clearances were not obtained. These included an occupancy certificate, fire safety no-objection certificate, and licence for lifts. “The UPS room where the incident occurred was not part of the originally approved fire safety plan. It was created by altering the designated OP and preparation rooms without obtaining revised fire safety sanction for the modified layout,” the inquiry report said. It also said that the glass panel of the UPS room was broken by the panicked hospital staff during the incident allowing the smoke to spread to other areas. “In this case, not breaking the door might have contained the smoke for a longer period and provided additional time for rescue.

During the period, the special squads also registered 1,768 cases, thus delivering a strong blow to the inter-State and inter-district drug trafficking network. Senior officials with the anti-narcotics squad said that the forfeiture of illegally acquired properties by suspected drug traffickers and the preventive detention of repeat offenders under the Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (PIT NDPS) Act had significantly boosted enforcement efforts. During the campaign period, the police reportedly seized 3,353.5 grams of MDMA and 123.6 kg of ganja, along with substantial quantities of hashish oil, ecstasy pills, and brown sugar. Figures from the District Crime Records Bureau (DCRB) also confirmed that the special squads had maintained consistency in their field-level actions in tracking drug trafficking cases. Last year, the squads arrested 1,985 suspects under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, registering 1,835 cases, including 31 incidents involving commercial quantities of drugs. “A key initiative in 2025 was the stringent forfeiture of illegally acquired property under section 68F (1) of the NDPS Act, 1985. Properties of around 10 repeat offenders were forfeited with sanction from the Appellate Tribunal for Forfeited Property established under the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act, 1976,” said a police officer who was part of a series of flash inspections conducted under the District Anti-Narcotics Special Action Force. He added that efforts were continuing to forfeit assets of more frequent offenders. As per the DCRB records, the total quantity of MDMA seized last year was 3,107.52 grams.

The suspects — K. Dijin,19, C. Athul Krishna, 19, Amjad Shah,20, T. Afnan, 20 and K. Sarang, 20 — were arrested from Kozhikode and Malappuram districts on November 15 with 57 counterfeit currency notes in the denomination of ₹500. The police, led by Assistant Commissioner of Police A.M. Siddique and Inspector T.S. Sreejith, were also able to recover a printer and 30 paper sheets procured for printing purposes during a flash inspection at the house of Dijin at Ramanattukara. Although Sarang, a painting worker and Afnan, a history undergraduate student, reportedly admitted to initiating the illegal printing activity recently “as an experiment,” the investigators said they were yet to be convinced by the explanation. Preliminary findings suggested that the group might have received assistance from experienced gangs in the field and attempted to circulate counterfeit notes to more local residents in Ramanattukara, they said. According to police sources, the seized fake notes and early evidence pointed to an organised effort to make substantial quantities of fake notes and circulate them for quick returns. They said the gang, however, used only low-quality papers as it was reportedly an experimental phase. A senior officer associated with the probe said Sarang and Afnan were found to have key involvement in the illegal act. The printer and the papers used for the crime were purchased very recently, he said, adding that the probe was in full swing to track their past. “The nature of the operation suggests they had external guidance.

Chidambaranar Port Authority, which has already taken initiatives to minimise greenhouse gas emission from the seaport by installing solar power panels, is all set to use fully electric tugboat in near future. The tugboats are powerful and highly manoeuvrable vessels used to pull and push larger ships as these cargo-laden vessels enter or exit the crowded seaports from or to the open outer harbour via narrow canals, and help with hassle-free berthing or unberthing of the ships. The diesel-powered tugboats are to be replaced in a phased manner by inducting the electric vessels to minimise the greenhouse gases emanating from the port during the operations. According to the chairman of V.O.C. Port Authority Susanta Kumar Purohit, the Port has placed an order for a state-of-the-art green tugboat as part of the ‘National Green Tug Transition Programme’. The contract has been awarded to Mumbai-based Knowledge Marine and Engineering Works Limited (KMEW) for the supply of a fully electric tug with 60 tonnes bollard pull capacity. This tugboat, to be fabricated in Mumbai, will be delivered within two years. The contract is valued at ₹385.76 crore and includes operation and maintenance of the tug for a period of 15 years. “This initiative is part of the ‘Green Tug Transition Programme’, aimed at phasing out diesel-powered tugboats at major ports and replacing them with green tugboats powered by battery, green ammonia or hydrogen.

Contributing funds for materials from their own pockets, workers of the labour colony laid the road on December 1, putting an end to a decades-old ordeal. The last time the road — which is about 200 metres and connects the workers’ colony to the Aiyappa Temple in the village — was asphalted was more than 30 years ago when the Kudremukh Iron Ore Company Ltd.

This hit hard, as the majority of residents in the colony were migrants from distant places who had come to work for the company for daily wages. While regularised employees of the company were transferred to different units, contract labourers lost their source of income. They remained in the colony and decided to take up whatever jobs came their way. Of the 170 families in the colony, many have been working in plantations and construction sites. A few have shifted to nearby places in search of a living. They have had no electricity supply all these years.

Speaking at a function at Mangalore University, the Chief Minister said that head of Sivagiri Mutt Swami Satchidananda, who is also president of Sree Narayana Dharma Sanghom Trust, had requested for the land. The Chief Minister said that MLC and Congress leader B. K. Hariprasad and others could search and identify government land suitable to open the branch of the mutt. The function was jointly organised by Brahmashree Narayana Guru Study Chair at Mangalore University and Sivagiri Mutt to celebrate the centenary of the meeting and conversation between social reformer Narayana Guru and Mahatma Gandhi at Sivagiri Mutt on March 12, 1925. Mr. Siddaramaiah said Swami Vivekananda, who was distressed by the caste system and untouchability in Kerala, had called it a madman’s market. In such a madman’s market, Narayana Guru created awareness against the caste system and untouchability and provided a dignified life to the people who were below in the caste system. Narayana Guru proclaimed to the world that “all humans are of one caste, one religion and have one God”. He also practically established social, religious dignity and equality for the oppressed sections of society. The Chief Minister said that Narayana Guru fought against the caste system, and superstition in society. He fought to eradicate the superstition and blind traditions of the lower castes. He made marriages simple by avoiding extravagance and spending. He encouraged all community mass meals.

The directions were passed after Ravindranath Shanbhogue, a human rights and consumer rights activist from Udupi, filed an original application seeking the removal of endosulfan cans dumped in five abandoned wells in Minchinapadavu Hillocks, within the Kerala border, near Nettanige-Mudnur village of Puttur taluk at Dakshina Kannada district. He had also sought directions to Karnataka and Kerala governments to provide potable water to villages where traces of endosulfan had been found in the groundwater. He had also sought analysis of groundwater within a five kilometre range of abandoned wells where PCK had illegally dumped endosulfan. During the hearing on the application on October 29, Mr. Shanbhogue’s counsel, Gaurav Kumar Bansal, submitted that the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), in its first report on January 1, 2024, reported about “278 barrels of endosulfan, whereas only 20 barrels were recovered” (as mentioned in the NGT order). However, the latest CPCB report of July 16, 2025, “accounted only for 69 barrels and recommended their disposal through incineration”. The counsel contended that the remaining barrels must be traced to fully eliminate the presence of endosulfan in the groundwater.

To an unstarred question by Captain Brijesh Chowta, Dakshina Kannada MP, in the Lok Sabha on December 2, the Minister said that the recognition underscores the district’s strong export potential and aligns with ongoing efforts to promote balanced and sustainable economic growth across the country. The identified focus areas under this initiative are expected to further strengthen local industry, enhance value-added activities, and expand market opportunities for enterprises in the region. The designation is aimed at fostering increased participation in global trade and supporting long-term development within the district, he said. Under the DEH initiative, the government is undertaking a structured process to identify and address district-specific export bottlenecks, including those relating to logistics, connectivity, and warehousing, Mr. Prasada explained. For Dakshina Kannada, a District Export Action Plan (DEAP) has been formulated, highlighting requirements for improved export infrastructure, including enhanced first-mile linkages to New Mangalore Port, augmentation of warehousing and consolidation facilities, and support infrastructure for identified export products, the Minister added. Further, a District Export Promotion Committee (DEPC) has been constituted to facilitate coordinated action among district authorities, exporters, the port authority, customs, logistics agencies, and relevant Union and State departments.

Chowta flags harmful impact of zero duty arecanut imports from LDCs on Indian farmers Large-scale arecanut imports from Least Developed Countries (LDCs) such as Bhutan, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka have been adversely affecting India’s domestic arecanut market, severely impacting farmers in key producing regions, Capt. Brijesh Chowta, Dakshina Kannada MP, said in the Lok Sabha on Monday. Raising the matter under Rule 377 on the first day of the Winter Session of Parliament, Capt. Chowta said that those countries currently enjoy zero customs duty under India’s Duty-Free Quota-Free (DFQF) preferential trade scheme — a provision originally intended to support LDC economies and now being misused in a way that harms Indian farmers. The zero-duty window has resulted in low-cost, inferior-quality arecanut flooding the Indian market, destabilising prices and pushing cultivators into distress. Between September 2023 and August 2024, Bhutan accounted for 57% of all arecanut import shipments, followed by Myanmar at 39%, and Sri Lanka at around 2%. India is fully self-sufficient in arecanut production, having produced around 14 lakh tonnes pan India in 2023–24, with Karnataka alone contributing nearly 10 lakh tonnes. Yet, despite this domestic abundance, large volumes of zero-duty imports continue to enter the country, creating a steep and unfair price disparity that erodes the competitiveness of farmers in major growing regions such as Dakshina Kannada, Shivamogga, Udupi, and Chikkamagaluru, the MP said. Reports indicate that India imported approximately 30,271 tonnes of arecanut during the first eight months (April–November) of 2023–24 — a volume that stands in stark contrast to domestic production and signals an avoidable reliance on imports despite clear self-sufficiency, he said. Capt. Chowta pointed out that normal arecanut imports attract 100% basic customs duty, but the DFQF exemption nullifies this protection entirely.

Mr. Rao said in the letter that Ramnath Thakur, Union Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare replied in the Lok Sabha on July 30, 2024, that natural rubber cannot be treated as an agricultural product since it is exclusively used as a raw material for industrial purposes. This has resulted in farmers being dependent only on the market and any slight fluctuations result in grave adverse financial effects and distress to rubber growers. He said that natural rubber has been kept out of the list of agriculture crops, for which the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices Commission recommends the MSP. “Hence, there is no MSP for rubber in India even though commercial crops like jute and copra are included. This has exacerbated the situation for natural rubber farmers,” Mr. Rao added. “It has to be submitted that even though the Department of Commerce had brought out the National Rubber Policy in March 2019, the results are not as desired and do not support growers owing to shortcomings in marketing, external trade, cheaper imports, lack of research, etc.,” the Minister for Health and Family Welfare said. Mr. Rao said that owing to the provisions of the Rubber Act, 1947, the rubber industry, including its cultivation, is under the control of the Union government. Since the Rubber Board of India is also under the Centre, States cannot interfere in the industry. Hence, only the Union government can address the matter of fixing MSP for rubber. It may be mentioned here that rubber growers of Karnataka at a conference in Ujire on November 29 demanded that the Karnataka government fix ₹258 per k.g. as the MSP for natural rubber.

A Bench comprising Chief Justice Shree Chandrashekhar and Justice Gautam Ankhad was hearing a set of petitions, including asuo motucase initiated in 2023, concerning rising air pollution in the city. Senior advocates Darius Khambata and Janak Dwarkadas, representing the petitioners, pointed out that Mumbai’s Air Quality Index (AQI) has consistently remained in the “very poor” category this month, often crossing 300. Additional government pleader Jyoti Chavan argued that the eruption of the Hayli Gubbi volcano in Ethiopia on November 23 had worsened the situation by sending ash clouds across the Indian subcontinent. The eruption produced a plume rising nearly 14km into the atmosphere,disrupting flightsand spreading eastward toward India.

1360,2025,The Hindu,1360,"Bombay High Court orders audit of construction sites to combat Mumbai’s air pollution  The Bombay High Court on Friday (November 28, 2025) emphasised that while improving Mumbai’s overall air quality will require a long-term strategy, immediate steps can be taken to curb dust pollution from construction sites through strict enforcement of existing norms. A Division Bench of Chief Justice Shree Chandrashekhar and Justice Gautam Ankhad, hearing a batch of petitions on deteriorating AQI levels in the city, constituted an independent five-member committee to inspect construction sites and verify compliance with mitigation guidelines. The panel will include one official each from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), two civil society representatives, and a public health official. The team will be provided with logistical support, transport, and security to ensure access to sites. The committee is expected to submit its findings within a week, after which the matter will be heard again on December 15. The court also directed the BMC and MPCB to file an action-taken report on measures implemented last year to tackle air pollution. “Ensure that the construction sites and dust pollution are tackled, and it has to be done immediately in one to two weeks’ time,” the Court said. Amicus curiae senior advocate Darius Khambata told the court that dust from construction activities remains one of the biggest contributors to Mumbai’s worsening AQI. He noted that the court had issued 27 detailed guidelines in 2023–24, including mandatory installation of air quality sensors, water sprinkling, and covering vehicles transporting construction material. However, compliance has been poor. Of nearly 1,000 construction sites in the city, only 400 have sensors, and 117 of those are non-functional. Moreover, these sensors are yet to be linked to a central monitoring system. Mr. Khambata warned against “knee-jerk reactions” whenever AQI spikes, calling for a concerted, long-term plan. “If even installing monitors mandated by",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bombay-high-court-orders-audit-of-construction-sites-to-combat-mumbais-air-pollution/article70335314.ece

In a release here, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) also clarified that the Graded Response Action Plan Stage-4 (GRAP-4), a set of tough restrictions aimed at curbing air pollution, is not applicable to Mumbai at present, though intensified monitoring has been instructed. Municipal commissioner and BMC administrator Bhushan Gagrani has directed officials to continue taking strict action against private construction sites as well as government and non-government projects that violate the civic body's 28-point dust and pollution-mitigation guidelines, it said. The BMC said the improved wind speed along with enforcement measures such as notices to errant construction projects, misting, water sprinkling, road-washing, awareness drives and move by  bakeries and crematoria to shift to cleaner fuels have contributed to the improvement in AQI (Air Quality Index) over the past 48 hours. The wind speed, which was 3-4 kmph before November 28 with high humidity, has now increased to 10-18 kmph, aiding pollution dispersion in the financial capital, the civic body noted. The BMC has formed 94 ward-level flying squads to oversee the implementation of pollution mitigation measures. These teams are inspecting private sites as well as road and metro project stretches, issuing stop-work notices wherever violations are detected. The squads are also checking sensor-based AQI monitoring equipment at construction locations, the release claimed. AQI is a number used by agencies to show air pollution levels in an area. There are 6 AQI categories, which are good (0-50), satisfactory (51-100), moderately polluted (101-200), poor (201-300), very poor (301-400), and severe (401-500).

The announcement follows a political storm triggered by Union Minister Jitendra Singh’s recent comments on the institute’s nomenclature. On Monday (November 24), during an event at IIT Bombay, the Minister of State for Science and Technology said, “As far as IIT Bombay is concerned, thank God it still has this name. You have not changed it to Mumbai. So that’s another compliment to you. And also true for Madras. It remains IIT Madras.” The comment drew sharp criticism from Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray, who accused the Centre of harbouring a mindset that undermines Marathi identity.

Ms. Salian, who managed late Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput, died on June 8, 2020, after falling from the 14th floor of a residential building in Malad. The police had registered an Accidental Death Report (ADR) at the time. A Division Bench of Justices A. S. Gadkari and R. R. Bhonsale asked the Public Prosecutor (P.P.) Mankuwar Deshmukh, “Five years have passed and still you say probe is going on. What is this? Someone has died, you need to only ascertain if it was a suicide, culpable homicide amounting to murder or not amounting to murder etc.” Ms. Deshmukh informed that the inquiry is being done minutely to rule out all possibilities and CCTV footage had been re-sent for forensic tests to rule out all possibilities. The Bench questioned why the police were reluctant to share basic case documents with the petitioner, Ms. Salian’s father Satish Salian. “What is the difficulty of giving basic documents to the father? He is covered by section 2(W)(a) of the CrPC, which defines ‘victim.’ What is this difficulty? Please take instructions on this,” the court said. Ms. Deshmukh submitted that the statements of Mr. Salian and his wife had been recorded thrice, and each time they said they had no allegations against anyone. “Initially they said no allegations against anyone. In 2025, they raised this contention and made allegations,” the P.P. informed the Bench. The court directed the police to produce copies of Mr. Salian’s statements and consider providing basic documents, including whether the post-mortem report and final cause certificate could be shared and present all of them in the next hearing. The matter will be heard next on December 11.

The decision came as the Court disposed of 2,006 petitions filed by Anjuman-I-Islam, along with petitions by National Kannada Education Society, South Indian Education Society, The Andhra Education Society, and the Association of Sindhi (Linguistic) Minority. A Division Bench of Justice Ravindra V. Ghuge and Justice Ashwin D. Bhobe observed that the issue had “worked itself out” and directed that teachers who served under interim orders between 2005 and 2008 should not suffer any loss of benefits. “The entitlement of aforesaid teachers to any further benefits/pensionary benefits shall not be denied only on the ground that during the period from 2005 to 2008 they have discharged duties on the post meant for undergraduate teachers. Subject to their entitlement, they would be entitled to all benefits,” the Bench ruled. The issue pertains to a government resolution dated January 17, 2001, which mandated that private secondary schools appoint 75% teachers with Diploma in Education (D.Ed) qualifications and only 25% graduates for standards V to VII. Advocate Arvind G. Kothari, representing the associations, said, “While intended to improve teaching standards, the rule created a crisis for English-medium schools, which struggled to find D. Ed-qualified teachers. At the time, Mumbai had very few D. Ed colleges, each with limited capacity, and most graduates were from Marathi-medium backgrounds, making them unsuitable for English-medium classrooms.” Faced with vacant posts and mounting pressure to complete the syllabus, schools turned to the courts under Article 226 of the Constitution.

Ltd.’s initial public offering (IPO), holding that the allegations of inadequate and misleading disclosures were “without merit” and that the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) had acted lawfully. The court also imposed a cost of ₹1 lakh on one petitioner for “deliberate suppression” of material facts. Delivering judgment, a Division Bench of Justices R.I. Chagla and Farhan P. Dubash observed, “We are satisfied that SEBI has exercised due care and caution and complied with the legal requirements, including those prescribed under the ICDR Regulations, in connection with the WeWork India IPO.” The Bench added, “Courts should be slow from substituting its own wisdom in place of the actions of SEBI.” The petitions, filed by Hemant Kulshrestha and Vinay Bansal, sought directions to SEBI to halt or amend the IPO, alleging that the Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP) and Red Herring Prospectus (RHP) failed to disclose serious criminal proceedings against WeWork India’s promoters and risks to its brand license. Both claimed SEBI had failed to act on their complaints. Senior Advocate Venkatesh Dhond, appearing for Mr. Kulshrestha, told the court, “There is gross and deliberate suppression of information, though the chargesheet filed by CBI mentions Sections 409 and 477A of IPC and provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, these have been conveniently omitted from the disclosures.” He added, “The disclosures also fail to reveal that besides the CBI chargesheet, another chargesheet has been filed by the Enfor",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bombay-hc-dismisses-pleas-against-wework-india-ipo-says-sebi-acted-lawfully/article70346085.ece

In a suit filed under the Commercial Courts Act, Ms. Shetty has named 28 defendants, including websites, AI platforms and global tech giants, accusing them of exploiting her name, image, voice and likeness without consent for commercial gain. The petition, filed through advocate Sana Raees Khan, seeks urgent ex-parte injunctions, takedown of infringing content, disclosure of seller details and damages of ₹5 lakh. Ms. Shetty has also requested the appointment of a court receiver to seize infringing merchandise and electronic data, and directions to government agencies to enforce removal of unlawful content. The actor’s petition said the defendants’ actions “violate my fundamental right to privacy under Article 21 and tarnish the reputation and goodwill I have built over decades.” She discovered the misuse in November 2025 when an event titled “Shilpa Shetty Award Show – Client Promotion Packages” was advertised without her consent. Since then, she claims, violations have continued daily across platforms. The petition alleges that AI-driven tools have created deepfake videos and voice clones portraying her in “obscene, indecent and defamatory contexts.” It also points to GIF-hosting platforms using clips from her films without permission, and e-commerce sites selling products such as “Shilpa Shetty Yellow Saree” and “Fear Less – Shilpa Shetty Celebrity T-shirt,” falsely implying endorsement. Jewellery marketed as “Shilpa Shetty Inspired Choker Set” and manipulated visuals circulating on Reddit and other platforms are among the cited examples.

A Division Bench of Justices M.S.

The petitioner approached the court after the Education Officer (Secondary), Zilla Parishad, Sindhudurg, rejected the approval proposal on August 21, 2018, citing lack of prior permission, non-compliance with advertisement norms, and absence of staffing pattern approvals. The officer relied on a Government Resolution dated February 6, 2012, which introduced new conditions for recruitment. Advocate Prashant Bhavake for Mr. Kale argued, “Appointment of petitioner on the subject matter post was clearly after due process and hence school management submitted a proposal to the Respondent No. 5 (Education Officer) for approval.

Citing multiple instances from public events and social media — such as the remark “Kisi Khan ko Mayor banne nahi denge and Aap jaisi Pakistan ki aulad se hum darte nahi, Malvani pattern ko”, the notice claims these statements are inflammatory and capable of inciting communal hostility and raises questions of why no FIR was filed. Days ago, Mumbai BJP Chief, Mr. Satam, stirred controversy after he said that Mumbai will not tolerate the “imposition of a Khan”. The remarks came after Indian-origin Muslim leader Zohran Mamdani won the New York mayoral polls and a debate around Mumbai having a Muslim mayor similar to New York. Another alleged hate remark from Mr. Satam came in support of BJP Minister Mangal Prabhat Lodha, when he filed a police complaint against Aslam Shaikh for threatening to finish him and his family.

As per the assessment by the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ghazipur police station in East District Delhi tops the ranking of best-performing stations in the country while the Bahour police station in the Union Territory (UT) bagged the eighth rank in the list. The ranking by the Ministry is an attempt to bring advanced reforms in the functioning of police stations in the country, said a police officer. In the initial assessment process, a few dozen police stations were shortlisted from over 17,000-odd stations in the country, and the final ranking was based on criteria that included crime statistics, overall maintenance of law and order, and better management of crime against women, crime against weaker sections, crime resolution, and service delivery. Apart from the aspect of crime control, the MHA also looked at the infrastructure facilities, cleanliness, approachability, and behaviour of police personnel while selecting the best stations. “The shortlisting is based on a diverse set of performance criteria. The criteria include crime prevention measures, efficiency in investigation, case resolution, and crime detection. The evaluation also incorporates feedback from regular service users such as local residents and traders,” he said.

The protest led to tense moments in the area and disruption of traffic. The agitation, organised in front of the Block Development Office, was led by Karaikal District Congress Committee president Chandramohan. Former minister M. Kamalakannan, several party functionaries and a large number of workers employed under the rural 100-day employment scheme took part. Protesters said they had been working continuously for three months in Karaikal region but had not received their wages. They demanded immediate disbursal of pending payments, pointing out that the workers’ families were struggling without income, especially during the monsoon when other sources of livelihood were scarce. Police personnel from the Town police station held talks with the agitators and asked them to disperse. However, the protesters insisted that the demonstration would continue until they received a firm assurance from the administration and shifted to a road blockade on the main thoroughfare, causing traffic congestion in the vicinity.

He assured them that the pending wages would be released within two weeks, following which the agitators withdrew the protest.

Mr. Rangasamy, in his address, requested the newly recruited employees to work with compassion and dedication.

Villages in Neravy, including Kizhamaai and Oozhiyapathu, were affected, with stagnant water in residential lanes. In Thirunallar, Ambedkar Nagar — which lacks proper roads and drainage — was worst hit. Other affected villages in the commune included Nal Ezhunthur and Ambagarathur.

A professor, armed with notes and years of experience, stands at the podium. The students are present, but their attention lives inside the blue glow of their phones, scrolling through reels, quick videos and AI‑generated notes. Today, this is a familiar scene; many in the staff rooms know about it. Yet beneath this everyday moment lies a serious question: in an India obsessed with technology, what and whom is higher education really for? There is a visible contrast across the Indian higher education system. A student in Mumbai can seamlessly stream a high‑definition lecture and submit code on a cloud lab. But this student’s peer in rural Madhya Pradesh has to climb to a rooftop to catch enough signal to download a PDF or take an online course in his native language. In 2022, a national survey on the Digital Divide in Indian Higher Education by Jitender Kumar Singh and others, highlighted that urban institutions enjoy significantly better connectivity, devices and support than their rural counterparts “Digital infrastructure remains deeply unequal across regions and institution type, the study noted. While bandwidth has improved in many cities, “institutional readiness and rural access still lag, constraining equitable use of EdTech.” The National Education Policy explicitly calls for “technology‑enabled, student‑centric learning environments” and insists on critical thinking and conceptual understanding as core outcomes. On the other hand, for millions of students, the smartphone functions more as an entertainment hub than a rigorous learning tool. So teachers seem to have an unenviable responsibility to turn that device into a gateway for thorough study. More than a technical challenge, it is a cultural and pedagogical shift that teachers need to achieve. Not easy. A point here: many of today’s lecturers were trained in a pre‑digital era.

Financial literacy is viewed as a critical 21st century skill around the world. Kerala has already brought out special textbooks on financial literacy as part of the revised curriculum in government and aided schools. While students from class V to VIII study content on financial literacy as part of skill education in 11 areas, the textbooks will help class IX and X students who opt for financial literacy for intensive skill development in one chosen sector learn more about financial discipline and how to manage money. To further enhance financial literacy among all students, a need to equip school teachers with the knowledge and skills required to implement the financial literacy curriculum more effectively was felt, and the RBI reached out to the General Education department. The department, in turn, entrusted the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) with the programme. In the wake of discussions between the SCERT and the RBI, it was decided that teachers will first be given a structured training to improve the effectiveness of financial education.

The policy, adopted in 1991, will be discussed and voted on later this week by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine advisers hand-picked by U.S. health secretary and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ""After extensive review, we did not discover safety or effectiveness data that support delaying the choice parents have to vaccinate their newborns against hepatitis B,"" said Michael Osterholm, an infectious-disease expert at the University of Minnesota who helped found the Vaccine Integrity Project that released the review. The Vaccine Integrity Project is an initiative dedicated to safeguarding vaccine use in the United States set up to counter controversial vaccine information and recommendations from the Trump administration that are lacking or contrary to scientific evidence. The revamped CDC advisory panel, following Kennedy's firing of all 17 previous expert members, in September decided to postpone a vote to delay the birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine.’ Since then, U.S. President Donald Trump and other health officials have called for delaying the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine until as late as age 12, saying that the virus is largely sexually transmitted. Osterholm said the evidence clearly supports keeping the current U.S. policy. Hepatitis B is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis B virus. It primarily spreads through blood, semen, or certain other body fluids. Infants infected with hepatitis B during their first year of life have a 90% chance of developing a chronic infection, increasing the risk of serious liver disease such as cirrhosis or cancer.

The government has provided a special discount on fees for below the poverty line or BPL families. O.K. Rajan, Balabhavan’s executive officer, says he is anticipating an increase in admissions this year. Registrations have jumped from 1,000 last year to 1,200 this year. He says the courses are designed for different age groups and students can choose the ones for which they have an innate aptitude.

Subsequently, Mr Potti, with the TDB’s permission, removed the panels from the temple for restoration at a firm in Chennai. Officials said the ongoing vigilance probe notably covered the recovery of two “gold-plated coverings reported missing from Sabarimala” from the residence of Mr. Potti’s sister in Thiruvananthapuram last month. The unit noted an “incriminating oddity” in TDB officials certifying the gilded panels earmarked for restoration in 2019 as made of pure copper. Officials said the vigilance wing also reportedly questioned Mr Potti over the four-month delay in depositing the panels taken out of the temple in 2019 for restoration and what transpired during the period. Officials said the vigilance is examining whether Mr Potti misused the temple property for “private poojas” based on 2019 video footage and photographs that have gone viral on social and conventional media. It is also examining whether Mr Potti or others had used the poojas for private fund collection and personal profiteering. Moreover, the unit is also re-examining the alleged four-kilogram reduction in the weight of the metals returned to the temple by Mr Potti in 2019 and why the restoration company in Chennai issued the 40-year warranty for the refurbished temple panels in Mr Potti’s name instead of namin",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/tdb-questions-unnikrishnan-potti-over-misuse-of-sabarimala-artefacts-for-private-worship/article70127664.ece

The yet-to-be-named baby hippo was born to Vimala, a 13-year-old hippo, and Gokul, a 11-year-old hippo that died on January 31 this year following liver problems. The two adults had mated before the death of the male hippo. The baby appears to be doing fine considering that it and the mother hippo survived an attempted attack by other female hippos. Following the incident, the other hippos were moved to a separate enclosure. Last year, one male hippo had died after a similar attack. The zoo authorities track how well the newborn hippo can float in water, its breath holding capacity, and how frequently it sucks milk under water to determine its overall health in the days ahead. In April last year, a hippo named Bindu had given birth to a female offspring named Babli. Though hippos live in small groups, they move apart when they are ready to deliver a baby. A few days after giving birth, the mother and child reunite with the group. Bindu and Babli too are back with their bloat.

Mr. Mamkootathil alleged that a television news journalist had contacted his “transgender friend.” He alleged that the newsperson queried whether the person had any complaints about the legislator’s behaviour. He accused the journalist of asking leading questions about their friendship to ensnare him in a sexual misconduct conspiracy.

The rain, which followed a prolonged period of oppressive heat, significantly lowered the mercury levels. However, the torrential rain, accompanied by lightning, led to waterlogging in various areas across the city.

It’s the day when only women are allowed on many streets in the heart of Thiruvananthapuram. The ritual remains a celebration of the legendary journey made by Kannagi after destroying Madurai. She is believed to have stopped at Attukal and her divine transformation began as Attukalamma before she left for Kodungallur in central Kerala. The Pongala ritual has turned into one of the largest gatherings of women anywhere in the world, and in 2009, the Guinness World Records recognised it as the largest religious gathering of women on a single day when over 25 lakh women took part. This year, the ritual was held on March 13. Over the years, the ritual has branched out from the Attukal Bhagavathy temple to the periphery of the city through the narrow lanes as well as the arteries of the Kerala capital. Devotees start rushing to the temple to catch a glimpse of Attukalamma before they secure a spot within a wide radius of the temple for the ceremonial Pongala — the main ritual, which means “to boil over”, involves the cooking of a delectable mix of rice, jaggery, ghee, and coconut to be offered to the deity. When devotees start preparing the Pongala timed by an official announcement from the temple, the entire city is engulfed by smoke and its streets are filled with fervour and enthusiasm.

During the wet spell, they should avoid applying fertilizers, spraying pesticides or using weedicides, and instead closely monitor pest and disease incidence, resorting to plant protection only when it crossed the economic threshold. Where yellowing and nutrient deficiency were seen, farmers had been advised to spray a solution prepared by mixing 2 kg of urea and 1 kg of zinc sulphate in 200 litres of water, and to provide about 25% additional nitrogen and potash as top dressing to flood-affected crops on the advice of field officers. Field bunds should be kept clean, green manure crops encouraged and chemical fertilizers used strictly at recommended doses. With the northeast monsoon expected to last till the end of December, Mr. Akash asked farmers to promptly inform local Agriculture officials of any fresh damage and obtain technical guidance. For horticultural crops, he advised earthing up around plants and trees, staking and propping, and reducing crown load in perennial crops like coconut where necessary.

As many as 111 farmers have been affected, according to a preliminary assessment. Vegetable growers are among the worst hit, with 32.4 hectares of crops under water. The affected area includes 10 hectares of tapioca, 7.2 hectares of brinjal, 6.7 hectares of bhendi, 4 hectares of amaranthus, 3.5 hectares of gourds and cucumber, and 7one hectare of green chilli. Many of these crops were either nearing harvest or at peak growth stage, leaving 49 farmers facing substantial losses. Banana plantations have also suffered severe damage, affecting 48 farmers. Officials point out that banana, with its long crop duration and high input cost, is particularly vulnerable to waterlogging and wind damage, and that several fields close to harvest are likely to suffer near-total loss. P. Prabhakaran, a banana cultivator from Aarupathi in Tharangambadi taluk, had raised the crop on three acres, hoping to harvest during theKarthigai Deepamseason and in the following month. However, heavy winds on Saturday night uprooted and toppled a large number of plants. “Around 450 banana trees were flattened, and the crop is beyond recovery,” he said, adding that while farmers invest in banana expecting steady returns, “a single spell of extreme weather every couple of years is enough to wipe out everything and disrupt our livelihoods.” Flower cultivators reported losses over 5.75 hectares, including 2 hectares of chrysanthemum and marigold, 3 hectares of crossandra and tuberose, and 0.75 hectares of jasmine, affecting nine farmers.

The protest, called by the association’s central working committee, sought redressal of long-pending service-related issues. Holding banners and placards, the protesters raised slogans in support of their demands. Their key demands include an increase in the 25% kilometrage allowance exemption from Income Tax, expediting the recruitment and training of ALPs, ensuring that running staff are not kept away from headquarters for more than 48 hours, and limiting night duty to two consecutive nights. They also raised several local grievances of the Waltair Division, including utilisation of LPs for 12-hour duties, granting only 12 hours of trip rest instead of the prescribed 16 hours, and bypassing designated headquarters or relief points at Simhachalam North and Vizianagaram under the pretext of crew underutilisation or yard congestion. CITU State general secretary Ch. Narasinga Rao and district general secretary R.K.S.V. Kumar joined the protest and expressed solidarity with the striking staff. Addressing the gathering, Mr. Narasinga Rao demanded the withdrawal of the Centre’s four Labour Codes, alleging that they were anti-worker and tilted in favour of managements and industrialists.

Mr. Amit Bardar told reporters that Nanda had joined the dalam in 2023 and was later moved to the 26th Platoon of the Kerlapal Area Committee. He said the surrender was driven by falling cadre morale in West Bastar, where sustained police operations and the establishment of several police camps since 2024 have disrupted Maoist activity. Continuous pressure has led to multiple surrenders, weakened the organisational structure, and halted new recruitment in the region.

The SP said the State’s surrender and rehabilitation policy has encouraged more young cadres to return to the mainstream by offering financial support, skill training, and other welfare measures. He assured that all eligible benefits would be provided to Nanda.

1456,2025,The Hindu,1456,"CPI says government reneging on promise to protect Visakhapatnam Steel Plant Communist Party of India (CPI) State secretary G. Eswarayya has condemned what he described as the “anti-people and anti-worker” policies of the Central and State governments and their alleged attempts to hand over public lands to private investors in the name of development and employment generation. Mr. Eswarayya was in the city on Tuesday to participate in the general body meeting of the party’s district unit. Speaking to reporters on the occasion, he said that while the Modi and Chandrababu Naidu governments claimed to protect workers’ interests, they were in fact extending red-carpet treatment to private investors and corporate groups, many of which failed to comply with labour laws. The Labour Codes introduced by the Centre were detrimental to workers, he alleged. The CPI leader said the Chandrababu Naidu government had failed to implement most of its election promises, including the payment of unemployment allowance to jobless youth and monthly financial support to women under the Aada Biddi Nidhi scheme. He alleged that the government had already borrowed ₹2 lakh crore, and that its repayment burden would ultimately fall on the people. Electricity consumers, he said, were already bearing an additional burden of ₹12,000 crore in the form of True Up charges. Referring to the Chief Minister’s claim that agreements worth ₹27 lakh crore were made at the recent Global Investors Summit in Visakhapatnam, Mr. Eswarayya questioned how many companies had actually invested and how many jobs were created as a result of such summits held since 2014. He also criticised the government for allowing the closure of cooperative dairies, sugar factories, and spinning and ginning mills, asking what plans were in place for their revival. He accused the TDP-led government of going back on its promise to protect the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) and of showing more interest in handing over vacant lands in the city to corporate groups.

The cameras and lights seen on the film set of the 1950s pertain to the era, sourced and restored to appear new, as they would have been in their prime. Cinematographer Dani Sanchez Lopez reveals that Rana’s father, producer Sureshbabu who spearheads Ramanaidu Studios, contacted several studios and older theatres across India to source the equipment. “He was particular that we got what was relevant to the period. The lights were painted, restored and we used them to light up the scenes for the film within the film,” says Dani, speaking from his home in Madrid, Spain, after wrapping up a romantic thriller shot in Canary Islands.

1466,2025,The Hindu,1466,"IFFI 2025 | ‘Magellan’ movie review: Lav Diaz’s subversive epic traps Gael García Bernal’s conquistador fantasy Lav Diaz’sMagellanis an impossible fever dream across the seas, smuggled into the respectable body of a festival biopic. On paper, the 160-minute Cannes-premiering historical epic in colour, fronted byGael García Bernal, is pitched around a name every schoolbook knows. But in practice, it works as a slow, methodical dismantling of the conquistador legend from a Filipino vantage point, hollowing out the great navigator in a tale about imperialism, complicity, and the people who were meant to stay on the margins. The film opens in Malacca, 1500s, with an indigenous woman waist-deep in a river, checking stones, the forest around her thick with green and humidity. She spots a white figure and bolts; panic spreads through the settlement, and the “promise” of a foreign God is misread as blessing. Diaz then cuts to the aftermath with the earth churned, corpses strewn and the new arrivals moving through the carnage with insouciance. From there the film’s formal strategy is clear. Battle rarely appears in motion, but violence arrives as still life in its various manifestations. The square 4:3 frame and the Lumix cameras’ cool, painterly colours trap us inside these tableaux of conquest, as a series of colonial altarpieces where the saints are outnumbered by the dead. Magellan himself enters this landscape almost sideways. The ever-charming Bernal plays him as a man pulled forward by a combination of injury and entitlement: wounded in Malacca, restored in Lisbon by Beatriz, rejected by one crown and adopted by another, before finally sailing under Spanish colours toward an Eastern route that will make him indispensable. Diaz tracks him in fragments, through blessings and negotiations. The film’s emotional logic keeps cutting back to his betrothed Beatriz, left ashore with a child in her body and a husband in love with the sea. In dreams, she returns in soft focus, as a domestic ghost that belongs to a different film (the rumoured nine-hour Beatriz cut hovers like a phantom ov",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/iffi-2025-magellan-movie-review-lav-diazs-subversive-epic-traps-gael-garcia-bernals-conquistador-fantasy/article70334672.ece

He delivers a slim, haunted triptych in which adult children circle their parents like cautious satellites, testing the limits of duty, guilt and whatever passes for affection once the script of childhood has long since ended. The architecture is simple. Three chapters. Three cities. Three configurations of kin who see one another rarely and never quite know what to do with the time. “Father” strands a brother and sister on icy American backroads as they head to their dad’s cabin for a welfare check. “Mother” gathers an English novelist and her two daughters around a fastidiously laid Dublin tea table. “Sister Brother” follows Parisian twins as they sift through the property of parents killed in a plane crash. A Rolex is seen slipping from hand to hand, toasts happen with a variety of different liquids, and the phrase “Bob’s your uncle” keeps turning up like an inside joke nobody fully understands anymore. The connective tissue is playful, though the mood under it remains bruised. For anyone fond ofMystery Train,Night on EarthorCoffee and Cigarettes, there is an immediate sense of lineage. Jarmusch is back in anthology mode, working again with Frederick Elmes and Yorick Le Saux, whose images of snow, china and storage units feel calmly tangible in an era of slippery VFX backdrops. The Saint Laurent money shows up in the knitwear and coats, but the frames still feel shaggy and lived in. “Father” is the chilliest piece on the surface and the one that kept expanding in my head afterward.

There is a Zen-like composure in his voice as we have a telephonic conversation and Pankaj says that he understands what it is like to produce a project. “It is like preparing for a girl’s wedding, where you have to do the casting of the girl as well,” Pankaj quips. Perfect FamilystarsGulshan Devaiah, Girija Oak Godbole, Neha Dhupia and Manoj Pahwa and tells the story of a dysfunctional family that decides to go to therapy together. It is also the first show released directly on YouTube with a pay model. Two episodes of the series are available to watch for free and the rest are accessible at a one-time payment of Rs 59. Pankaj says that the decision was taken as they didn’t want another creative involvement on the show. “We also wanted to explore a new model and see if it works. It will open pathways to independent creators if the trend is set,” he says. “It could even reduce piracy as no one would mind paying Rs 59 to watch an entire show without taking a monthly subscription.” A still from ‘Perfect Family’.

After Mohit Suri’sSaiyaara,Aanand L Rai, another master of the poetic portrayal of passion and pain, returns with a gripping interrogation of love’s destructive underbelly, set in a social context. Connected toRaanjhanaa(2013) by an umbilical cord,Tere Ishk Meintalks of the magic of love that is lost in modern life’s logic, which entices us to trade emotions. In Rai’s universe, love is both poison and panacea, and once again, he has taken up a risky subject — the transformative power of romance. Here, he dissects the anatomy of violence that the so-called alpha male/stalkers unleash with a painterly flourish. He doesn’t see him as a domineering ‘animal’ out to secure his territory in some concrete jungle, but as an everyman who inhabits the gully behind the shining India. His hurt, his rage, feel real — not a cosmetic counterpoint to the rise of the heroine in popular culture. Together with A.R. Rahman, Rai composes a chaotic symphony of desire and despair that seeks to strike a balance between psychological depth and unhinged melodrama, often tilting towards the latter. Dhanush and Kriti Sanon in a still from ‘Tere Ishk Mein’ Photo: Special Arrangement. Beyond the mythical iconography, Shankar (Dhanush) and Mukti (Kriti Sanon) present the clash of two world views on romance that have existed from time immemorial. Son of a notary (Prakash Raj), Shankar, a student activist, carrying the hurt of his mother’s painful death, is a feral force who is leading a lower-middle-class existence. Mukti, a student of psychology, sees Shankar as a potential subject in her doctoral thesis on social violence, in which she postulates that love can cure rage. She sees violence as an appendix that can be done away with without harming the body politic, but she can’t see the storm that brews beyond books and labs until it threatens to sweep her away. Reduced to a stone, Shankar initially sees her as a body with utilitarian value for ‘fun’.

I went in wanting a desert movie with cool music and walked out with the Sahara forming in the cave in my chest. If you’ve ever wondered what a subwoofer manifesting purgatory sounds like,Siratis the answer. The French-Spanish filmmaker opens his Cannes Jury Prize-winner with a swarm of bodies moving to electronic pulses in the southern stretches of Morocco. The rave is a temporary republic of heat, dust and dance, where enormous speakers rise like edifices, and the gathering seems immune to interruption. You feel the rhythms of this early sequence in your ribcage before you register in your head, and Laxe shapes this space with observational calm, letting the rave breathe long enough for us to understand what’s about to be lost. Into this gathering walk Luis (Sergi López), his young son Esteban (Bruno Núñez Arjona), and their dog, Pipa. Their presence is plain, as if they’ve taken a wrong turn, but they’re here because Luis’s daughter vanished months ago after chasing a circuit of itinerant parties. The rave becomes an improvised search site, and the only way forward emerges through a casual exchange when a group of ravers mention another gathering farther south, close to the Mauritanian border. These ravers are different flesh — Jade, Tonin, Bigui, Stef, and Josh — people whose bodies narrate more than their mouths, replete with tattoos, piercings, a prosthetic leg and a missing forearm. Laxe casts many of them from the Free Party movement he’s known for a decade, and builds on these non-actors who know how to move in a crowd. Their fidgety energy unsettles Luis, but it’s enough for them to follow. A still from ‘Sirat’

There are sight gags, including the police officers saying “lay down the spikes” and rolling out a porcupine, and clever puns such as the Burning Mammal festival, Piña koalas, and the wicked Dawn Bellwether (Jenny Slate) bearing more than a passing resemblance to acertain refined psychiatristwith a fondness for a nice chianti and fava beans. Then there are all the animal puns from the pair of zebras called Zebros and Captain Hoggbottom to the touchy sea lion and the sloth named Flash (Raymond S. Persi). The Arctic shrew mob boss who sounds like Don Corleone and theStar Warscantina recreation (complete with stepping on a tail) are bound to garner giggles. The animation is dazzling in the creation of eye-popping worlds and chase sequences — the escape through the water chute is breathtaking. Like the previous film, the sequel written and co-directed by Jared Bush (who wrote the first movie) makes a strong case for inclusivity, and not judging a book by its cover.

The hospital staff said that many such patients were admitted with attendants claiming to have found them abandoned on the streets. While the medical team ensures immediate stabilisation and treatment, the challenge intensifies once the patients recover, as securing space in NGO-run old age homes was becoming increasingly difficult. According to the TECC authorities, nearly 60 abandoned senior citizens have been shifted to shelters and old-age care facilities since January. The actual number, they caution, may be far higher, as families increasingly push the responsibility of caregiving onto the public healthcare system. The medical staff said, “This trend reflects growing social neglect and the urgent need for stronger support structures for vulnerable senior citizens.” On November 25, a 61-year-old man was brought in an unconscious condition by a woman who claimed she had picked him up from an NGO. He was later diagnosed with pancytopenia - a serious condition characterised by reduced counts of all major blood cells. “After stabilisation, he is able to walk and communicate. But when we contacted the phone number given during the admission, the woman denied any relationship with him. However, the patient insists she is a family member,” said a hospital staffer. The Hindualso contacted the woman but she refused to accept she was related to the patient. Asima Banu, special officer (in charge) of TECC, said the staff routinely encounter such cases of abandonment. “We have seen over 60 such patients this year.

1473,2025,The Hindu,1473,"‘Andhra King Taluka’ movie review: Ram Pothineni and Upendra lead this feel-good tribute to cinema Some bonds defy rational explanation, like the devotion an ardent fan feels for a film star. What drives someone to go to extraordinary lengths for an actor who may never know they exist?Andhra King Taluka, written and directed by Mahesh Babu P, frames itself as a “biopic of a fan” to explore precisely this question. Through the fictional journey of Sagar (Ram Pothineni), an admirer of superstar Surya Kumar (Upendra), fondly called the “Andhra King”, the film examines how fandom shapes identity and ambition. Mahesh Babu steers clear of the darker edges of obsession unlike Maneesh Sharma’sFan, withShah Rukh Khan, or the pitfalls of fandom depicted in the Telugu anthologyAnger Tales,featuring Venkatesh Maha. He also avoids interrogating whether stars exploit their fan bases. Instead, he crafts a feel-good, coming-of-age drama in which cinema becomes fuel: sparking Sagar’s dreams, inspiring his village, and ultimately looping back to lift the very star he worships. The story of mainstream cinema and its ecosystem gets an equally mainstream treatment — flamboyant colours, songs, dances, romance and tears. Set in 2002, before smartphones and the bifurcation ofAndhra Pradesh, the film uses rural East Godavari as a backdrop where moviegoing is a communal ritual and people readily travel from village to village to watch their favourite stars. Interestingly, a film that celebrates cinema, stardom and fandom opens with the superstar’s decline. In his lavish home lined with awards, Surya (Upendra) confronts a newspaper report likening him to a setting sun. The metaphors are direct: Surya the star, Sagar his devoted fan from an island with no electricity, and Mahalakshmi (Bhagyashri Borse) as the inevitable symbolic presence. Both men need money — Surya to survive a slump, Sagar to prove the power of hard work and belief. Sagar’s unwavering loyalty is rooted in a childhood moment of cinema-fuelled hope, contrasted with the realism of his friend Eshwar (Rahul Ramakrishna).

Over 79 minutes I drifted in and out of wakefulness, slipping into a light, enchanted semi-haze where whispers bounced off stone, bird-call and water flowing through streams folded into each other, and the most haunting liturgical voices seeped through the hall like incense.

When the first season dropped in 2016, it felt like a secret broadcast meant for kids who grew up combing through their parents’ dusty DVD shelves and cassette collections. It matchedmy fixation with ‘80s pop cultureso perfectly that I treated its cracked-open world of Dungeons & Dragons, walkie-talkies and suburban dread as a kind of initiation rite, and defended it with the zeal of a convert. The Duffers had tapped into that earnest, fragile something in me where childhood still held and the darkness (of adulthood) beyond felt half-imagined. A decade later, the show returns for its final run in a form that resembles its younger self only in outline, like a photocopy that’s been run through too many machines. Volume 1 of the final season opens with thatGame of Thrones-style confidence of a franchise expecting loyalty. Now a military containment zone, Hawkins is wrapped in metal plates and checkpoints — the logical extension of last season’s border rupture. The rushed bluntness with which these details are handled is pronounced, and the season barely considers the lived impact of such an environment. This is the first sign of a larger problem: the Duffers have constructed a world too large for the story’s emotional frame to bear. Theensemblesteps back into place with familiar rhythms. Mike, Will, Dustin, Lucas, and Eleven have aged into mid-teens within the story’s timeline, even as their actors wear the unmistakable signs of adulthood. It’s easy to catch how the show attempts to reconcile this with digital smoothing during a de-aged Will flashback, oversized costuming to soften proportions, and blocking that keeps faces in forgiving light, but the effect is still distracting.Stranger Thingswas once about kids encountering terrors beyond their comprehension, and now the kids look like they should be filing taxes.

InRevolver Rita, starringKeerthy Suresh, director JK Chandru fumbles telling one such tale, stripped to its banal denomination, creating a predictable crime-comedy that reads like ‘Tamil crime-comedies for dummies.’ A generic feud between two generic rival gangs leads a generic revenge-thirsty villain to hire a muscle, who in-turn hires a pimp, to trap the gangster father of his gangster enemy. I will refrain from using ‘generic’ now because the scene that follows seems salvages this generic (I tried) gangster-drama introduction by slowly pivoting into popcorn fun, for a bit. Instead of taking a left at an intersection and going to the fifth house on the right, the gangster Dracula Pandian (Super Subbarayan), seeing stars after a bong rip, takes the right and goes to the fifth house on the left — the house where chicken shop-owner Rita (Keerthy Suresh) lives with her short-fused but pious mother (Radikaa Sarathkumar) and two sisters.

But I had never expected this level of appreciation,” says Dinjith.

None of the scripts I read gives me the kick that I get from his writing. His talent is on a different level and I find it interesting to travel through the world his stories create,” he says. Dinjith adds that in this era of social media explosion, you need fresh content to excite people and he is in awe of the freshness that Bahul brings to the table. “Audiences’ expectations put immense pressure on us to make the film work. When people ask about how I took the risk of making such a subject work at the box office, the truth is the thought did not cross my mind when I decided to direct it.

1485,2025,The Hindu,1485,"No, no, noise: The noise cancellation science Our reality is a yes, yippie one for noise. We are always swimming in it. Sound waves pervade our atmosphere and a certain portion of those sound waves are what we refer to as noise (Sounds change into its alter ego ‘noise’ when we, subjectively, don’t want them there or think they are too disruptively chaotic, silly).  But, it is possible to build a temporary reality sans noise. We owe this new reality to the science of noise cancellation. Sound engineers are always looking to make sound more ambitious. It didn’t take them too long to master the art of cancelling noise. In 1934, German inventor Paul Lueg discovered that we could control unwanted sounds. That is, if a sound wave is unwanted, it could be muted by the introduction of an opposing sound wave of the same frequency which cancels that wave. Sound engineers are always looking to make sound more ambitious.

                                Unsplash Images Soon it would gain popularity. Noise cancellation is also referred to as Active Noise Cancellation (ANC). You might have often seen the acronym in headphone ads. By the 1950s, the active noise cancellation method was properly researched and getting implemented. Shortly thereafter, ANC became the state of the art, crucially commercialised by headset companies. There are three major components that make noise cancellation work. They are: 1. Microphones These do the job of detecting target sounds from the atmosphere. 2. Processor (processing system) Once the sounds are captured, the processor will analyse the sound. Frequency, magnitude, etc. are calculated and another sound is generated in the opposite phase (inverse wave form). 3. Speakers They send out this “anti-sound” which will then interact with the original sound (noise). Active noise reduction.

1486,2025,The Hindu,1486,"Nothing Like Lear: Vinay Pathak clowns around in adaptation ofKing Lear For any lover of English literature, Shakespeare is always an exciting reason to foray into the unexplored areas of the language. You can criticise him, but you cannot loosen the grip he holds over theatre and art even after centuries. In a telling, poignant, modern adaptation ofKing Lear,one of the Bard’s most well-known tragedies,Nothing Like Lear, explores the relationship between a father and his daughters from a slightly different lens. Starring Vinay Pathak in the role of a clown, Rajat Kapoor, who has directed the play, has made the narrative universal and contemporary. In a candid conversation withThe Hindu, Vinay talks about the play, his love for acting, his experiments with Shakespeare and his love for theatre. Vinay believesKing Learis one of Shakespeare’s biggest and best plays, which can be adapted into many beautiful forms. “It is a story about a king and his three daughters. When he retires, he tests his daughters’ love for him. There is treachery, loyalty and the ensuing family drama. It is perfect to portray on stage because it has something for everyone.” “Ours is a modern adaption of the play,” he continues, saying, “Rajat and I created this adaptation to look at the relationship between a father and a daughter; not just how it was in the Elizabethan times, but also with today’s generation. Not just in royal families, but in the common man’s life. What Lear stands for, what patriarchy stands for, can be beautifully explored with this adaptation, and we have been a little cheeky with it.” Nothing Like Learexplores the relationship between a father and his daughters

1487,2025,The Hindu,1487,"‘Eternity’ movie review: Miles Teller, Elizabeth Olsen, and Callum Turner shine in this rom-com across ages There are different parts of David Freyne’sEternitythat can pull viewers out of the film. The first is the question of why everyone looked young and happening in the afterlife. That was quickly explained by the AC (afterlife coordinator). People apparently choose to appear as their happiest selves in the afterlife, which explains the abundance of 10-year-old boys and the complete lack of teenagers, according to the AC. That leads to the second element which prompts the mind to wander. As one watches the dilemma of the three protagonists on screen, one wonders what one would do in a similar position. Larry (Barry Primus) and Joan (Betty Buckley) have been married for 65 years and as they drive to a gender reveal party of their great grandchild, they bicker like the old married couple they are. Larry chokes on a pretzel and dies, waking up as a younger man (Miles Teller) on a train that halts at an incredibly busy station where everyone seems to be heading somewhere, except Larry. It takes him some time to realise he is dead, and that he has a week at the Junction to choose his eternity. A still from the film

1489,2025,The Hindu,1489,"‘Gustaakh Ishq’ movie review: When poetry becomes verbose An ageing poet, his stoic daughter and a cunning publisher make the subjects of filmmakerVibhu Puri’s student film,Chabiwali Pocket Watch(2006). Set in the ruins of old Delhi at an unspecified time, there are signs of an impressionistic, young mind in its eerie romanticism. The high contrast visuals, filled with meticulously designed frames, garner too much attention and there’s little sign of life infused in the characters. While there seems to be some potency to the idea, the short film just allows a glimpse and fades away. Maybe that’s why Puri returns to the same world with a refurbished feature almost 19 years later. This time, though the canvas is vast, the vision remains obscure, and the poetry is lost in excess. Gustaakh Ishqtakes the seed of the short film and just expands it without much revision. The story is now anchored from the perspective of Nawabuddin Saifuddin Rehman Rizvi (Vijay Varma), who finds it difficult to make a living with his dying printing press. Living with his argumentative young brother and a weepy mother, Nawab finds purpose when he hears stories of a poet who once enchanted everyone, but was never published. Nawab decides to seek him out and strike a deal for his poems. However, Aziz Beg (Naseeruddin Shah), the ageing poet, has been living a life of anonymity in Punjab’s Malerkotla with his recently divorced daughter, Mannat (Fatima Sana Shaikh). Not disclosing his intentions right away, Nawab decides to win Aziz over by becoming hisshagird(disciple). The film is said to be set around 1998 but is perpetually lost in time. The overworked production design and heavily refined costumes seem to replicate the ‘60s more. Producer and costume designer Manish Malhotra leaves his stylised signature in the robes (even a cat has an outfit to carry), taking away the realism from the tale. However, Puri is not particularly interested in subtlety.

But thankfully, the dissonance fades quickly. Taiwanese-American filmmaker and long-Baker collaborator, Shih-Ching Tsou’s voice floods her directorial debut with an eye-level empathy that shrugs off Baker’s recent excesses and shields the film from my misgivings. Her command steadies the collaboration so completely that, for the first time since last year, I feltmy irritation with Baker(who has co-written and edited the proejct) loosen its grip.

She captured the nuances of music through colours. Soon, what emerged was the painting of Parvati  embracing the lingam at the Kamakshi temple in Kanchipuram. Aarthi describes the process as meditative  and creative. When asked how she manages to complete the painting before a concert ends,  she says,  “Initially it was challenging. Although illustrating on the iPad would be easy, watercolour is my favourite medium.

1497,2025,The Hindu,1497,"Monochrome landscapes and abstract photographs come together in new exhibition Legendary American photographer Ansel Adams once said, “Landscape photography is the supreme test of the photographer — and often the supreme disappointment.” It is a line that sums up the quiet brutality of the genre, and one that Chennai-based photographer Srinivasan Periathiruvadi relates to immediately. “The challenge with landscape photography is that it requires a lot of patience,” he says. “You have to think about composition, what to include, what to leave out.” Srinivasan has been photographing the wilderness since 2005 and has shown his work in several solo and group exhibitions. This week, he returns to The Folly, Amethyst with a new body of monochrome landscapes titled Mountains and Mugil, that were shaped over years of travelling through high-altitude terrains in Kashmir and Ladakh. His friend Jayanand Govindaraj will exhibit a series of abstract photograph that explore intentional camera movement alongside. Srinivasan’s photographs distil mountains, clouds, and light into something almost meditative, inviting viewers to slow down and stay with the silence between forms. “I chose monochrome because it’s a challenge. Today, millions of colour images are made on phones every minute. Black and white strips all of that away, and it leaves you with only tones, light, and form. I wanted to experiment and see how people respond to that on the walls,” he says. A photograph from Mountails & Mugil

At first glance, it is easy to mistake his work as having been fashioned out of clay, when, in truth, the artiste has used ceramic and bronze to create the figurines he will be displaying at his solo show, Primal Connections. Scenes from everyday life — tete-a-tetes, yoga poses, livestock, mother and child, moments of solitude — that are forgotten as they pass by take shape in Reghu’s work. “Human lives are fraught with tension, whether you are living in a war zone or are battling personal challenges. Yet most of the time, the source of these anxieties is manmade. Sadly, the worst hit are women, children and the aged. All my pieces are created in the hope of bringing a sense of quiet to the day.” He continues, “For me, the Mother and Child series evokes love and compassion, while Yoga induces a sense of peace and calm.

1502,2025,The Hindu,1502,"Chennai hosts a sneak peek of the Serendipity Arts Festival’s milestone edition For one night in Chennai, the long arc of a decade-old art festival quietly found its way into a hotel ballroom. There were no banners, no festival frenzy, just an art enthused crowd filtering into THE Park Chennai, curious about why Goa’s biggest annual multi-disciplinary arts gathering, the Serendipity Arts Festival, had chosen to make a pitstop here. The answer unfolded gradually. It began with a performance by musical collective Uru Paanar, whose music does not ease you in so much as root you to the floor. Their vocals rose over the hum of the room, carried by ancient Tamil musical instruments like the yazh, urumi, pepa, and sangu, which are rarely heard outside niche archives. It set the tone for an evening that was not a preview in the traditional sense, but an argument for why the Serendipity Arts Festival’s tenth edition wants to meet audiences where they are, before bringing them to Goa. “Art isn’t something you go looking for. It should come looking for you,” said founder–patron, Serendipity Arts, Sunil Kant Munjal, setting the framework for the evening’s conversation. He was not making a grand declaration so much as stating a principle that has shaped the festival’s tenth edition. Ranvir Shah, Sunil Kant Munjal, Priya Paul and Narayan Lakshman

For instance, we had already started rehearsing the first half of the playPadma Vyuham, when Mouli said he needed more time to complete the play. But YGP  said he wouldn’t ask for a postponement as he had already booked the performance dates. So, I sought Rajamma’s help. She told YGP that the reputation of the group was because of the quality of their plays, and that postponing an inauguration would do less harm than a poorly-done play.

Grand Palais RMN Christophe Fouin From the moment you enter Galleries 38 and 39, the tone is set: this is an immersive experience, a walk through a queen’s identity. The first section outlines Antoinette’s arrival in France as a 14-year-old Austrian archduchess in 1770, her marriage to Louis XVI, and her gradual rise as an arbiter of taste in the French court. Grant notes that while Antoinette “is still seen as a by-word for excess and frivolity, it is a trope based on mythology”. The exhibition’s aim is to reposition her not as a caricature, but as a woman who shaped the culture of her age and whose style continues to reverberate. Marie Antoinette Styleat the V&A

Her maiden exhibition currently on at Vyloppilly Samskrithi Bhavan in Thiruvananthapuram bears testimony to that. She takes you through the stories behind the paintings with childlike-glee. Art had taken a backseat once she became a doctor. After 30-odd years in the profession, it was last year that she went back to her passion. By then both she and her husband, Dr Shajehan Sivasankara Pillai, who worked in the neurology wing of a reputed private hospital in Thiruvananthapuram, had quit medicine. Since then life has revolved around their passion for cycling, swimming, and photography. All her paintings, done in water colours, acrylic, oil and soft pastels, are based on photographs, either clicked by her, Dr Shajehan or other photographers. “My husband has always loved photography. His job as a neurosurgeon did not allow him to pursue it seriously. But during the pandemic, there was a lull at work for both of us. Since we were doctors we had access to areas under lockdown and that was when we explored Thiruvananthapuram with our cameras. While I took a detour and concentrated on painting, he still pursues it seriously,” she says. Paintings by Dr Usha Shajehan exhibited in Thiruvananthapuram

His latest series, Figuring the Edge, at Ashvita’s, channels that spirit through abstraction. This is a body of work born not from a narrative, but the undoing of it. For decades, Raghava has been known as a storyteller who has blurred the boundaries between art and technology, and emotion and intellect. But here, he steps away from the story . “Stories make us what we are,” he says. “Stories are the cause of many innovations and helped homo sapiens master the world; they are also the source of much destruction, so when you hold on to stories very tightly, they break; I want to show what happens when stories break.” Raghava KK

I have made hundreds of sketches before arriving at this. Each artwork is accompanied by a question, and the painting becomes the answer.” Figuring the Edge by Raghava KK

Some art historians have scrutinised the sale for cultural reasons, while others have raised concern that the painting — last exhibited publicly in the late 1990s — could again disappear from public view after the auction. It has already been requested for upcoming exhibitions in cities including New York, London and Brussels. The piece depicts Kahlo asleep in a wooden, colonial-style bed that floats in the clouds. She is draped in a golden blanket and entangled in crawling vines and leaves. Above the bed lies a skeleton figure wrapped in dynamite. Kahlo vibrantly and unsparingly depicted herself and events from her life, which was upended by a bus accident at 18. She started to paint while bedridden, underwent a series of painful surgeries on her damaged spine and pelvis, then wore casts until her death in 1954 at age 47. During the years Kahlo was confined to her bed, she came to view it as a bridge between worlds as",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/frida-kahlos-self-portrait-sells-for-547-million-shatters-auction-record-for-female-artists/article70305902.ece

At  Rahaman Decoration in Parry’s corner. At Parry’s Corner, the holiday rush is in full swing, especially inside Rahaman Decoration Centre, a 30-year-old wholesale shop teeming with parents, children, and couples sifting through endless aisles. The crowd here is not aiming for a trendy pink Christmas tree or ceramic Santa, but the charm of old school decor — star lanterns, plastic Santa masks, nativity sets and everything reminiscent of Christmases past. “It’s quite a busy time for us. This is when everyone starts shopping, and being a wholesale shop, we get customers ranging from store owners to college and school teachers,” says Afreen Fathima, daughter of Syed Karimulah, the owner of Rahaman Decoration Centre.

A horde of details about a tiny library at East Mada Street in Thiruvanmiyur are hanging in the air, but it has been pulled out of the back room and thrust into the public glare -- and that is commendable indeed. This library’s  physical design raises questions about its longevity. It is wooden and cannot be left in the open during rains. When the skies tear up, it can scoot to the shelter of a tarpaulin canopy installed primarily for two wooden benches made of discarded wood and a wooden chair.  Even if the skies are clear, it is not all-clear for this library at night.

                                PRINCE FREDERICK The library was birthed by the recently launched Project Thiruvanmiyur Mada Street, an effort to reimagine the Mada streets around Marundeeshwarar temple. Dhanya Rajagopal, architect and urban planner, is among the prime movers behind Project Thiruvanmiyur Mada Street, and she remarks that the library comes with some in-built protection -- “it is lined with a sheet of acrylic panel on top; and the wood is coated with weatherproof paint.” “More than the rain, the worry is people might steal it. Hence the need to keep it indoors when there is no one to keep an eye on it. The library is kept back inside a local’s parking area in the night. And brought back in the morning,” says Dhanya. The model by which the library would be run is yet to be identified. At present, the exercise is powered by optimism and support from various quarters, some not expected. Here is what is happening as expected: books are being donated by residents; the lion’s share of the donation so far has been from two residents, Harini Krishnakumar and her fat",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a-small-fledgling-library-in-chennai-residents-donate-books-shopkeepers-watch-over-it/article70316160.ece

This veteran photojournalist from Thiruvananthapuram is a trained painter, a photographer and a documentarian — three roles that he tapped into at the start of this project.

The images seamlessly blend with one another, creating the illusion that the pictures were taken at the same instance. Gireesh shot the photographs across India and Sri Lanka during his days as a photojournalist. “We spend hours waiting at different spots during our assignment. And often, we are unable to bring together all elements surrounding a subject into a single, wide-angled frame — therefore, losing the subject’s essence. As a solution, you shoot more, from different angles, and when we stitch these images together, it gains a new meaning,” says Gireesh, who thought of the exhibition in 2010, compiling images for the project since. The show features 40 works captured on film and digital media. The photographic installations are inspired by the techniques of the American visual media artist, Man Ray. “Two of the first works in the collection, Puffs & Politics and Still, Edge of Fear, were taken in 2005.

What if children school their elders in the grammar of conscious living. What if children are conversant with the idioms of sustainability, source discards and transform them into desirable, eco-friendly, everyday utilitarian objects and eye-catching decor. On November 15, at Kid’s Kraft Carnival 2025 — Edition 2, organised by Boutique Bougainvillea and The Kraft Faktor in Velachery, a group of children demonstrated that these what-ifs can be realities. Around a dozen children in the 10 to 15 age bracket were holding sessions on a variety of art-based practices defined by sustainable processes. The children showed the attendees how to make origami-based decor, quilled wall decor, quilled jewellery, artwork on upcycled boards, clay-based art and palm-leaf decor. Various other art forms were also in attendance (crochet, macrame and decoupage among them) and all of them were viewed through the lens of sustainability and the eyes of the young ones that have mastered them through sustained practice. Some of these children have take these skillsets beyond weekend sessions to build brands that fuse sustainability with art. Undoing a knotty problem Thirteen-year-old Keshavanath Shankar stumbled into macramé a year and a half ago, when idle hours at home and the absence of a television demanded a more creative diversion. Crochet proving difficult, he began experimenting with knots after noticing friends and online creators working with macramé. “It just felt comfortable,” he says of the craft that has since become his daily practice.

The year India was born, Husain, with a host of other famous artists in Bombay, such as FN Souza and SH Raza, founded the Progressive Artists Group that steered the direction of Indian art into a modernist era. Husain died at 95, his nearly 40,000 artworks inspired by the rich heritage and culture of his mother country, long after he left its shores to find new homes and citizenship abroad. His works ranged from oil paintings, watercolours, lithographs, serigraphs, sculptures, and installations to poems in Urdu, Hindi and English, and films such as the 1967 Golden Bear-winner,Through the Eyes of a Painter.

The dancer also drew a parallel with the lives of several women, who, for generations, have been silenced — told how to behave and how much to endure. Whenever a woman asserts herself, questions norms, or demands justice, her dignity is attacked. She is shamed or suppressed, yet, she rises (unscathed). ‘Draupadi Unbound’ is about reclaiming that voice: the voice of a woman who breaks free, and charts her own path toward freedom.

Each kriti, steeped in Sanskrit poetry and infused with aesthetic precision, reflects his deep understanding of Advaita Vedanta. That artistes continue to find new meaning in his works even after 250 years is a testament to his enduring relevance. It was this spirit that the Janaki C.S.

Carnatic vocalist Ashwath Narayanan led the music ensemble, while scholar Dr. Sudha Seshayyan compered the presentation. The performance opened with ‘Vallabha nayakasya’ in Begada, and Ashwath’s resonant timbre and unhurried gait created the atmosphere of a traditional temple invocation.

The three-day festival, held recently at Sri Krishna Gana Sabha, featured a range of programmes — Bharatanatyam, Kuchipudi, Kathak, a theatrical storytelling and a seminar. It concluded with a Nritya Natika titled ‘Kaalam Uruttum Dhaayam’ by the students of Jigyasa Giri. This was the first time that a Kathak production was presented in Tamil. Comprising five sequences, it portrayed the game of dice from the Mahabharata, Draupadi’s humiliation, the Kurukshetra war and Krishna’s Vishwaroopa darshanam. The production ‘Kaalam Uruttum Dhaayam’ had more theatrical elements with Kathak footwork patterns and movements visible only in a few places.

Their powerful movements and expressions captured the spirit of the characters, adding to the overall impact of the presentation. The production had more theatrical elements with Kathak footwork patterns and movements visible only in a few places. The use of twisted stoles by the main characters as a prop to depict a checkerboard was imaginative. The costumes, comprising dhoti pants, jackets and stoles, offered an eclectic mix of colours, patterns and styles. However, a more defined colour scheme to distinguish the Pandavas from the Kauravas would have created a strong visual appeal. Choreographically, the continuous movement of all characters on stage felt somewhat repetitive, making the sequences a little monotonous. The use of twisted stoles to depict a checkerboard was imaginative.

1522,2025,The Hindu,1522,"Renowned Bharatanatyam artiste Kumari Kamala passes away Legendary Bharatanatyam artiste Kamala Lakshminarayanan, fondly known as Baby Kamala and later Kumari Kamala, passed away in California at the age of 91. She was one of the last links to the transformative decades when sadir was reborn as Bharatanatyam and reclaimed as a classical art on the public stage. Along with her guru, Vazhuvoor Ramaiah Pillai, Kamala came to define the ornate, lyrical Vazhuvur bani for more than half a century. Under his guidance, she helped establish the style’s signature blend of grace, flowing lines and dramatic sweep as the reigning aesthetic of mid‑20th‑century Bharatanatyam. Her nritta was marked by clarity, fluidity and finish, while her abhinaya had the unforced immediacy of spoken poetry, resting on a deep grounding in Carnatic music. Born in 1934, Kamala went on to straddle both stage and cinema. She toured the world extensively, and eventually settled in the U.S., where she continued to teach and advocate for the art. Honours such as the Padma Bhushan and the U.S. National Heritage Fellowship acknowledged what rasikas already knew: that she was one of Bharatanatyam’s defining modern architects.​",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/kumari-kamala-bharatanatyam-passes-away/article70321254.ece

One where contemporary dance is understood as a practice and not merely a show of athleticism and physical flexibility that it is perceived as. And at the core of MFOK is BOHO, a community of contemporary dancers the three dancers created.  The three have been collaborators since 2021 when Sreejith called Laxmi to discuss this idea, of a community and a possible collaboration for it. That resulted in BOHO. Abhilash is also a dancer and one of Sreejith’s students. Nerpala

Sreejith had been thinking of a community like BOHO for several years. A veteran choreographer, he speaks of providing opportunities to young dancers that he never had when he was young and starting his journey in dance. “Space, time and opportunities were the things that I did not get, but I wanted to change that.

She goes beyond the literal, and challenges the idea that classical dance is rigid, narrow and too removed from the present — her recent performance at Bangalore International Centre only proved this. Even if her choreography occassionally feels like a departure from the norm, she is careful to retain the look and feel of the classical dance form. But Sharmila and her disciples do a few things quite differently. She frequently appears as a sutradhaar, reading the programme notes from a stylised red book. Likewise, when the programme ends, instead of a traditional mangalacharan, she showers a few white flowers on the edge of the stage, before slipping away into the darkness. Sharmila Biswas performing at the Bangalore International Centre recently.

                                Courtesy: BIC This way, Sharmila does treat enshrined tradition as too heavy a subject but considers it a lived, felt and shared community experience that even allows room for gentle humour and joy. That joy is hard to miss in a piece such as ‘Gati Vilas’, presented by students Raaginni Hindocha, Koushik Das, Dipjoy Sarkar and Biswajit Mondal from OVM (Odissi Vision & Movement in Kolkata). Next came  ‘Murta Maheshwara’, where Shiva is portrayed as the protector of animals — regal as a lion, powerful as a horse, soft as a swan, musical as a cuckoo, graceful as a peacock and as precise as a hawk. Students of Sharmila Biswas depicted the different attributes of Shiva in the group production titled ‘Murta Maheshwara’.

Set against the cultural backdrop of Madurai, the performances traces Meenakshi’s journey as princess, lover, queen , warrior and ultimately, as goddess. Blending dance, music, poetry, and textile traditions, ‘Meenātchi’ seeks to capture not just a mythic narrative but the very spirit of Tamil culture and heritage. “For me, the identities of a daughter, sister, mother, lover, even a warrior are the easiest to choreograph,” says Divya. “Because these are lived experiences. I have had to be a warrior myself, in personal and professional spaces, when something went wrong or when loved ones needed protection. In that sense, Meenakshi is easier to understand as a daughter and a warrior than as a goddess. The divine is simply the whole of these parts.” Divya Nayar

1528,2025,The Hindu,1528,"IND vs SA first ODI: Kohli steals the show as India goes one up The full house at the JSCA International Stadium Complex here enjoyed three hours of Virat Kohli at his absolute best. It was vintage stuff — wristy flicks, charging at pacers, and straight drives from the Sachin Tendulkar playbook. It was a fitting response to those who questioned Kohli’s future in the ODI set-up. A sublime 120-ball 135 proved that Kohli is here to stay. The next World Cup may be two years away, but Sunday’s (November 30, 2025) knock was a reminder of the tremendous value that Kohli brings to the national team. The Kohli masterclass led India to a narrow 17-run win over South Africa in the first ODI. Fighting knocks from Matthew Breetzke (72, 80b, 8x4, 1x6), Marco Jansen (70, 39b, 8x4, 3x6) and Corbin Bosch (67, 51b, 5x4, 4x6) threatened to ruin the Kohli party, but the home side had just enough in the tank to sneak through. The sense of nostalgia peaked when Kohli and Rohit Sharma come together for a 136-run second wicket partnership. Rohit, who like Kohli is active only in the ODI format, made the most of an early drop by Tony de Zorzi. Rohit took apart off-spinner Prenelan Subrayen with massive slog sweeps. A trademark pull to a short ball from Jansen took Rohit past Shahid Afridi for the most number of sixes hit in ODI history. Indian players celebrate after taking a wicket during the first ODI against South Africa in Ranchi on November 30, 2025.

This dip in November came right after a net inflow of ₹14,610 crore in October, an uptick that had broken a three-month streak of withdrawals — ₹23,885 crore in September, ₹34,990 crore in August, and ₹17,700 crore in July, according to data from the National Securities and Depositories Ltd. (NSDL). The flow trend through November was shaped by a combination of global and domestic factors. “On the global front, uncertainty around the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate-cut trajectory, a firm U.S. dollar, and weak risk appetite across emerging markets kept foreign investors cautious. Persistent geopolitical tensions and volatile crude prices further reinforced the risk-off tone,” said Himanshu Srivastava, Principal, Manager Research, Morningstar Investment Research India. Domestically, this cautiousness was compounded by pockets of stretched valuations and subdued industrial indicators, which tempered investor conviction despite India's relatively stable macroeconomic backdrop, he added. Reflecting this sentiment, Vaqarjaved Khan, Senior Fundamental Analyst at Angel One, noted that the outflows in November were primarily driven by global risk aversion and volatility in tech stocks. IT services, consumer services, and healthcare were among the sectors that faced the sharpest impact. However, not all indicators point toward a sustained bearish trend. V. K. Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, believes there is still no clear evidence of a trend reversal in FPI flows.

But he was not surprised and went on to explain all about awards and what they meant to him. On December 12, 2025, the Sri Krishna Gana Sabha will confer the Nrithya Choodamani title upon him. “My first response was tears,” he said. The tears, he added, were for his late father, who had watched him at every step of his artistic journey, and believed in him when the world did not. Narendra spoke of his journey as a male dancer, and his influences such as V.P. Dhananjayan and Sharada Hoffman (Chinna Sharada). VPD was one of the first male dancers he had watched as a child in Mysore. Of Sharada Hoffman, he says that it was her philosophy towards life that hugely inspired him. It was she who encouraged him to think, question, analyse and reason things out. It was because of her that he was able to judge the merit of every situation and event and weigh its deeper meaning. Like many artistes, Narendra too sought fame, success, awards and recognition. But he was soon disillusioned, because male dancers did not get the opportunities that they should. His alma mater Kalakshetra (where teachers such as Prof. Janardhanan and Krishnaveni Lakshmanan taught and inspired him) provided several opportunities but they were essentially for group productions. Narendra longed to take his solo flights. It was here that he faced the challenge. He braved several hurdles and the lack of solo opportunities soon saw him resign himself to accepting the reality, but never one to give up, he continued practicing with rigour every single day choosing alternative venues such as the temple premises to showcase his art.

1532,2025,The Hindu,1532,"Dancing beyond 60: Avantika Bahl’sPrimeproves that age is just a number The eight artistes on stage had two things in common — they were all over 60 and shared a love for dance. Though they began training in different dance styles at a young age, some continued to pursue their passion, while others paused for personal reasons, only to rediscover their love for dance years later. The dancers — four men and four women — were a part of choreographer and contemporary dance-practitioner Avantika Bahl’s 75-minute show ‘Prime’ (staged last month at Mumbai’s IFBE Hall). They had been rehearsing for nine months. Avantika says the aim of ‘Prime’ is to look at movement and the ageing body. “As we grow older, our movements change. Yet, the ageing body carries wisdom, memory and lived experience. The show is a testament to resilience.” Avantika, who has choreographed Aadyam Theatre’s ‘Mumbai Star’ conceptualised this show almost “seven years ago”. The eight performers, aged between 60 and 71, each have unique stories. Jhelum Paranjape, born in 1954, is an accomplished Odissi artiste. Venkatesh Iyer, now 70, began as a dancer and later choreographed wedding sangeets and community events. Venkateswaran Akileswaran, born in 1958, is a pathologist who started dancing when in medical college and returned to the art at age 50. Faredoon Dodo Bhujwala, born in 1960, has been a well-known dancer and choreographer for 45 years. Saraswati Devdas (born 1962) and Sunila Ashok (born 1963) took a break from dancing but later returned to practicing regularly. Francis D’Sa Cardoso, born in 1964, and 60-year-old Manuella F. Cardoso have been actively involved in Mumbai’s cultural scene.” Taking into account the fact that ageing is a slow, acquired transformation, Avantika began to wonder what happens to dancers when they started ageing. She says, “A time is reached when one is at the crossroads of knowledge and ability. You know exactly how you may be able to do something, but your body may not be able to support you fully.” Avantika Bahl

Flags cut-out of Muzirabad silk wave in the evening breeze. The Londoners were transported to a landscape of new meanings, says dancer- choreographer Jayachandran Palazhy, who is also the founder and artistic director of Attakkalari. He has conceptualised this site-specific, transdisciplinary performance. Sonnet of Samsara,he adds, is a response of our times to myth, experiences and memories. It represents the idea of transformation of a hero; mapping of his journey from childhood to adolescence. “It is a response of a society to civil war, climate change… It is the need for us to be more reflective, wiser and composed to deal with cataclysmic changes that have happened in the world.” Explaining the genesis of this creative work that took shape during the pandemic, Jayachandran says, it was like a little bird gathering twigs to make a nest. “Homes, that used to be a place of solace, suddenly became our prison, workplace and many different things. It disrupted our existence.   It made me think about the human journey, our evolution and transformation. That’s how it all started.”  According to Jayachandran, “the open-air setting of DakshinaChitra is a repository of our architecture and folk culture. This piece sits well there.

This is a reflection of India's new thinking, innovation, and youth power,"" PM Modi said in the 128th episode of his 'Mann ki Baat’ address. PM Modi referred to a video on social media of a unique drone competition organised by ISRO.

PM Modi recalled that the young team tasted success after several rounds of failure when the drone crashed. He said the scientists at ISRO too were disappointed when the Chandrayaan-2 lost contact, but built upon the failure to finally succeed with Chandrayaan-3. ""It was the success of the new confidence built after coming out of failure. I saw that same spark in the eyes of the young people seen in this video,"" he said.

1537,2025,The Hindu,1537,"How record-breaking feats by young Bharatanatyam dancers could distort the art formPremium Karnataka, my home state, has given birth to distinctive banis (styles) of Bharatanatyam such as the Mysuru and Kolar banis, each with its own lineage and aesthetic grammar. I come from Tulunadu, a region in coastal Karnataka that is equally steeped in cultural pride. As a Bharatanatyam practitioner from this region, I have long witnessed the passion with which our gurus and artistes strive to uphold and preserve traditional art forms. However, over the past few weeks, I have been deeply disturbed by a trend that, in my view, threatens the sanctity of the classical arts. When the news broke out that a young dancer from Mangaluru is performing Bharatanatyam for 170 hours in an attempt to set a world record, I was shocked. Not long after, another dancer from Udupi announced she would perform for 216 hours — presumably to surpass the previous feat. More recently, I have learned of yet another young dancer from Chikkaballapura district of Karnataka, who has performed  for 220 hours (10 days) during Navratri. Now, I hear a dancer from Bengaluru is attempting 250 hours, even before the Chikkaballapura girl has set her record. Where are they taking this? My initial reaction was disbelief. Is this even humanly possible? More importantly, is this even Bharatanatyam? Having dedicated decades to the study and performance of this art form, I can say with certainty that Bharatanatyam is not merely about movement — it is about depth, discipline and devotion. To perform a traditional margam, which usually spans one-and-a-half to two hours, takes years of rigorous training, physical endurance, emotional maturity and spiritual grounding. To suggest that one can perform continuously for several days raises serious questions — not only about the physical feasibility but about the integrity of the performance itself. What concerns me even more is the public celebration of such acts. Some well-known cultural organisations have chosen to honour and felicitate these record-setting dancers",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/how-record-breaking-feats-by-young-bharatanatyam-dancers-are-distorting-the-art-form/article70112124.ece

1541,2025,The Hindu,1541,"Kyrgyzstan holds snap parliamentary vote as opposition faces crackdown Polls opened in the Central Asian republic of Kyrgyzstan on Sunday (November 30, 2025) in a snap parliamentary election amid the arrests of opposition figures and the closure of independent media outlets. It is expected to cement the grip of President Sadyr Zhaparov, who has sought to suppress dissent in what was once Central Asia’s most democratic country. The vote is being held a year earlier than scheduled, a move that officials have justified by arguing that the parliamentary elections would otherwise fall too close to the 2027 presidential elections. There have also been sweeping changes to Kyrgyzstan’s electoral system, with 30 constituencies electing three lawmakers each. According to the Central Election Commission, 467 candidates are vying for the 90 seats in Kyrgyzstan’s one-chamber parliament, the Jogorku Kenesh. There’s also a gender quota system that requires at least one female lawmaker from each district. Analysts say candidates loyal to Mr. Zhaparov are likely to succeed thanks to the rapidly growing economy over which the Kyrgyz leader presides, fueled in part by Kyrgyzstan’s role in circumventing sanctions against Russia. Kyrgyzstan, one of the poorest countries to emerge from the former Soviet Union, is a member of Russia-dominated economic and security alliances, hosts a Russian air base and depends on Moscow’s economic support. It was formerly the site of a U.S. air base that was used in the war in Afghanistan. But Mr. Zhaparov has also sought to cement his position by cracking down on potential rivals. “The suppression of the opposition and independent media, the growing economy, and Russia’s support guarantee the current ruling elite’s hold on power,” Emil Juraev, an independent analyst in Bishkek, told theAssociated Press. “There is virtually no opposition participating in the elections.

1545,2025,The Hindu,1545,"The musical bridge called R.K. Shriramkumar R.K. Shriramkumar and I have known each other for nearly 40 years and, obviously, I have many stories to tell. But I am not going to share them with you. I am not going to describe his musical lineage nor explain his journey. Shriram symbolises an idea of Carnatic music that, in today’s world of immediacy and instant gratification, reminds us that gravitas is difficult to achieve. In this essay, I will discuss three ideas around his musical persona. Shriram’s music is often spoken of as being reminiscent of a bygone era, of belonging to musicians of an older generation. For many, listening to him is nostalgic. This impression is not unexpected considering Shriram’s own demeanour and the fact that he had close associations with many musicians of the past. But, a closer analysis will reveal that his music is not old in that sense. It belongs in the present and, most crucially, is his own. What you hear is Shriram’s own interpretation of raga music that comes from his understanding of its various threads. Sometimes, his ideas are not in concurrence with the musicians of the past. But, something has definitely been lost in Carnatic music and Shriram reminds us of this loss. The loss is not the disappearance of a style nor of a way of thinking. It is the ability of musicians to be themselves yet hold close to their heart the abstractness of the raga experience. Shriram does this with ease, and hence challenges the present norm. Consequently, he is either celebrated as an emblem of the past or categorised as not being one with the times. Both these positions overlook Shriram’s ability to distil and retain from the past only what was quintessential while always being himself. Shriram is not a radical, but neither is he a conformist.

Sung in praise by the Saivite saints, the temple, together with the mandapam designed like a chariot, stands as a testimony to the creative zenith of the early Cholas. For lovers of books and music, however, the temple is inseparable from T. Janakiraman’s Tamil novel ‘Mogamul’ (thorn of desire) and the soul-stirring music of the Hindustani performers from Maharashtra. Janakiraman seems to have chosen the setting with clear intention. The musicians first appear at the Kumbeshwaran Temple, then at the house of Ranganna, the guru of Babu, the novel’s protagonist, and later give a full-fledged concert at the Nageswaran Temple. The temple’s atmosphere is perfectly suited to their performance. Even today, there is little change in the setting. The book cover of T. Janakiraman’s Tamil novel ‘Mogamul’

Conventionally, too, there is an opinion that Carnatic musicians do not pay enough attention to voice culture,” says Lalitharam, historian of Carnatic music. When Babu first listens to the Hindustani musicians at Ranganna’s house, he marvels at the sheer weight of the voice: “Can a human voice carry such weight? What strength there is!

1548,2025,The Hindu,1548,"What sets Muthuswami Dikshitar’s works musically apart? Muthuswami Dikshitar’s imposing musical virtues are being extolled over the past few months on the occasion of his 250th birth anniversary. One of the sterling aspects we would like to dwell upon is Dikshitar’s exposition of rare and difficult ragas and his contribution in bringing them to mainstream performance. Just for establishing the working grammar of so many rare ragas, Dikshitar should have got a Nobel-equivalent, had there been one. In order for a raga to be portrayed in detail, both in the kriti form and in alapana, a few requisites are a must: A distinct unalloyed scale, enough signature phrases, jeeva swaras and associated landing rules, distinctiveness in overall flavour, the opportunity to show differences with adjacent ragas without trespassing, and good contours for a wholesome experience rather than scale-based phrases. If a rare raga could be set to kritis with different hues, the vista of imagination for manodharma opens even wider. Dikshitar’s handling of Brindavana Saranga with the two masterpieces, ‘Ranga puravihara’ and ‘Soundararajam’ is a good place to begin. Dikshitar starts the two kritis in upper rishabam and middle octave rishabam, respectively, to force the contours to run differently, as only Dikshitar can. He then varies the tempo and gamakas distinctly to give each kriti its own charm. The ranges are also different, with ‘Ranga puravihara’ stepping into the melody of the top octaves regularly while ‘Soundararajam’ explores the depths of the scale artistically. To sing ‘rajam’ with its multiple karvais and sensitively optimised oscillation, in the lower octave, is a treat that the legend D.K. Pattammal had perfected. Between just the two compositions, Dikshitar gave us enough creative essence of the raga. Dikshitar explored Hindustani influences in other ragas such as Dwijavanti (‘Akhilandeswari’, ‘Chetasri balakrishnam’), Yamuna Kalyani (‘Jambupathe’) and others.

To him, ‘Adios’ is more than a song. “It is a statement that comes from a place of self-belief. I shed old versions of myself — failures, doubts, and expectations to embrace new energy.” Born in Hyderabad and now based  in Dallas, Vamsi is proud of his multicultural identity and blends Telugu and English in thetrack.  ‘Adios’ also marks an artistic shift in five years of his musical career. “It is about believing in your own timing, even when the world doubts you.

And, by the time we left for school, it had already flipped to Telugu and Hindi film music.” Radio was also a big part of his childhood. His father had enrolled Vamsi and his sister in Carnatic classical music classes but Vamsi gave up after a year.

1550,2025,The Hindu,1550,"‘Hip-Hop is about owning your identity’ : MC Couper Rapper MC Couper’s new track ‘Dayumm’ is about identity—a spirited celebration of the self. “I am confident about who I am now and the track is a reflection of that,” he says. ‘Dayumm’, which dropped three weeks ago, has a playful vibe with funky kuthu beats backing Couper’s characteristic flow. “I usually let the song do its thing, but here, a lot of thought has gone into the video, as well,” he says. The video was shot at his apartment and features him “in his space”, being himself and gaming. “In this day and age, your visual game has to be top notch. I try to keep the visual aspect of my videos more in sync with who I am,” he says. Though much of his writing now is spontaneous, he does go into self-imposed writing camps, something he used to do in his initial years. These camps are when he experiments with linguistic texture and lyricism. ‘Dayumm’ was born out of one such camp, says Couper. “It came together in a matter of hours. The ‘ratatata’ in the song is the pen going off,” he explains. Couper like to detail his verses; keeping it real, reflecting on life, identity, social realities and personal choices. Powerful lyrics don’t always have to stem from a place of anger, he says. “Most of us (rappers) start out angry. The stress, the frustration... and hip-hop is a powerful tool for self expression,” says Couper, “but I think I have moved on from there. For me, it has been about personal growth. I am comfortable in my skin. Now, my art is often about the people that I really love in my life. Hip-hop is a locally-rooted art form. It is about owning your identity.” MC Couper

This trip is a significant one, both professionally and personally for the musician, who was the winner ofThe Voice, Australia, in 2024. For the first time, Reuben, who was born in Goa and is now based in Perth, will be coming to Chennai as a part of his India tour to bring his music to audiences here, for ‘A Night with Reuben De Melo’ at Radio Room on Wednesday. “I will be doing a mix of originals which include my latest EPWhen The Show’s All Overas well as covers, encompassing folk, acoustic-driven pop, and reggae” he says, of the set list planned. A mining worker turned full-time musician, Reuben says he was raised on reggae and country music, and credits Bob Marley and The Wailers as massive influences as well as Johnny Cash. “Goan singers like Lorna Corderio and Alfred Rose too were major influences for me. Goan music is so eclectic, sort of like a calypso-jazz fusion, and it is all about rebelling, standing up for your rights and for each other. I always get a feeling of family from our music,” he says. His win onThe Voice, Reuben says, has allowed him to put his music in front of audiences internationally. “Now when I tour across Australia or other parts of the world, I do have people come up and request some of my original music. This has given my songs and my identity as an original artiste a lot more credibility,” he explains. As he gears up for his concert in Chennai, Reuben says the word ‘performing’ is a daunting one, and he  prefers to think of it as expressing himself. “When you say performance, you think it is for the people rather than yourself.

For a century-and-a-quarter, it has nourished generations of artistes. The sabha’s longevity is the visible manifestation of an organisation built upon vision, adaptability, community spirit and resilience. Named after the presiding deity of the Sri Parthasarathy Swamy Temple in Triplicane, SPSS first took shape as the Sangeetha Vidwat Sabha in 1896 and was officially registered under its current name in 1900 and functioned on the banks of the ‘Kairavini Saras’, the temple’s sacred tank. It is one of India’s earliest performing arts organisations and the oldest music sabha in South India. Manni Thirumalachar, founder of Sri Parthasarathy Swami Sabha.

From there, the Sabha embarked on a series of sojourns across Triplicane, with venues shifting from Peyazhwar Koil Street (1905-1910) and Thulasinga Perumal Koil Street (1910-1920) to the Kalavala Kannan Chettiar Maaligai (1920-1935).

During the music season, they play two to three concerts every day, switching gears among musicians as seamlessly as changing the tala between songs. “After a point, adapting to different musicians becomes instinctive,” says mridangist N. Manoj Siva, who has played in every season since 1987. The same sentiment is echoed by kanjira exponent K.V. Gopalakrishnan (first season 1994), ghatam artiste N. Guruprasad (first season 1998), violinist L. Ramakrishnan (first season 2004), mridangist N.C.

Ramakrishnan and Vittal say the increasing thematic presentations keep them on their toes, with rehearsals and professional filming adding to the experience. Bharadwaj feels the number of concerts has increased, and so has experimentation. Says Manoj: “In the earlier days, season and off-season concerts were not dissimilar. Now, there is an added expectation that artistes must present something different during the season. Because of this, there’s a reduction in the number of untried concert combinations — earlier, Sabha secretaries took the initiative to make them work.” He adds: “Also, the variety and complexity presented in pallavis is much more now.” To handle this, recordings of pallavis are often sent to percussionists and, sometimes, to violinists. Sometimes, online practice sessions and, less frequently, in-person rehearsals, have to be accommodated too. N. Manoj Siva

As we ring in the New Year in January, music lovers experience a sense of anti-climactic desolation as they head home feeling bereft. So, what else is new? To keep music lovers cheerfully engaged, columnists are invited to think out of the box. And there’s the rub, as Hamlet said. Over the years, every possible subject under the Sun concerning the Chennai music season has been covered — Sabha canteens and their lip-smacking menus, the idiosyncratic quirks and biases of music lovers, the predictable NRI wave swarming the sabhas in their Chicago Bulls and Taylor Swift outfits, newbies on the music scene, crystal ball gazing on future stars, while social media goes berserk with an overdose of video clips and promos.

Barely 10 years later, he was her regular mridangist. For almost five decades now, Krishnan Visweswara Prasad, this year’s Sangeetha Choodamani awardee from Sri Krishna Gana Sabha, has been a steady and dignified presence in the music field, known for his sensitive and unobtrusive musicianship. The first in his family to take to the arts, K.V. Prasad learned mridangam from Narayana Iyer, Parassala Ravi and TK Murthy. When he was 11,  he was a rock drummer for the band Stone Age, playing the self-taught triple congo, dholak and tabla, and an integral part of many local film music orchestras. At 17, he was regularly accompanying Carnatic luminaries visiting Ernakulam. After a BSc in Botany, Prasad sold automobile grease door-to-door and later was a parts-picker. “I had to earn a living,” he says. After a full day’s work, he would perform inkutcherisand orchestras in the evening. Unusual for that generation, his father V. Krishna Iyer actively encouraged music, stating that anyone could be a manager, but few could be artistes. No matter how late Prasad went to bed, his father woke him up at 6 a.m. with shlokas — for 30 minutes of mandatory morning mridangam practice ‘accompanying’ whichever musician was singing on the radio.

We have to create a new generation of rasikas who will appreciate, enjoy and encourage the arts,” says the 86-year-old, who still attends upto five concerts a day during the Music Season in Chennai, when he is called to inaugurate the festival in many sabhas. “We probably have to create a system where young parents can either bring in their children to concerts, without the fear of being judged when children cry, or offer a supervised space for children so that they get used to the ambience of the Season,” he says. However, technology, he feels, is a great boon, because parents can introduce children to the concert experience at home. It has been quite a few years since the Covid pandemic, but Kuppuswami Chetti says its effects are still visible in the music and dance circuits. “So many sabhas, which were operating out of rented premises, had to shut down. How could they sustain? Even sabhas that had their own premises struggled, because the number of people taking annual subscriptions came down. In one sabha I am a part of, that number came down from 600 to 200. When funds became an issue, it took the breath of the Season away,” he says. Though things are slowly limping back to normal, Kuppuswami Chetti says there is still a long way to go before things get back to their pre-Pandemic glory. Kuppuswami Chetti looks forward to the day when he will see more housefull boards. After decades in the service of the arts, he has seen everything from sabha members going home to home to collect money, to sabha secretaries having great recommendation power when tickets were hard to come by. “Today, can you imagine anyone standing in a queue for a recommendation for a paid ticket?” he smiles.

Forty years have passed since that day, and I am certain that this beautiful musical journey will continue for many more years to come. Shriramkumar has, without question, been my greatest inspiration in Carnatic music. I think that in order to perform this art form, in addition to hard work and passion, it is extremely important for a musician to think Carnatic. RKS is one of those rare artistes who not only thinks Carnatic, but truly lives and breathes it. A devoted scholar and an authority on the compositions of the  Trinity, he embodies discipline in kriti patantharam, upholds the purity of Carnatic creativity in manodharma, and demonstrates the utmost respect for language in every composition he renders. I think these are the qualities that every aspiring musician should seek to emulate.

Chandrasekaran, blind from the age of two, has travelled across the world and performed alongside revered Carnatic musicians.  “My mother and guru Charubala Mohan insisted I was no different from others,” recalls the Sangita Kalanidhi awardee. Charubala created innovative pedagogy, such as sticking paper on the violin’s fingerboard to help her son feel the swarasthanas, even as she persevered to make all aspects of life accessible for him and others. Mridangist Erode Nagaraj, a senior student of Umayalpuram Sivaraman, cannot walk, and his arms are weak with limited range of movement. Afflicted with  polio when he was two, Erode Nagaraj  was bodily lifted or crawled long distances until he could purchase a customised wheelchair. Born blind in a family without musical antecedents, N.S. Kamakshi learnt vocal and violin (from Parur M.S. Anantharaman, Sethalapati Balu and Suguna Varadachari), focussing on vocal eventually. Her father and brothers helped her internalise critical aspects such as pronunciations and word splits during practice. A regular performer, she says picking up co-artistes’ cues can be tricky when, for example, they might stress rhythmic syllables. Ghatam exponent Suresh Vaidyanathan

Suresh has directed the officers of Raichur City Municipal Corporation to ensure that quality potable water be supplied to the citizens. He was addressing a development progress meeting at the District Administrative Building in Raichur on Wednesday. The State government owes it to supply pure and quality drinking water to the people, and it must be a top priority. At least a ₹40 lakh grant must be reserved for water supply, repair of pipelines and required maintenance, he directed. The officers have explained to the Minister that drinking water is supplied after frequent necessary examinations at a laboratory at the University of Agricultural Science (UAS) when the Minister enquired about the supply of water and its quality. Corporation Commissioner Jubin Mohapatra said that there is considerable progress in collecting taxes under the CMC limits that were due. Mr. Suresh called the concerned officer over the phone and suggested taking immediate steps to appoint 75 pourakarmikas for Raichur CMC when Deputy Commissioner Nitish K. raised this issue and said that there was a proposal to appoint the required pourakarmikas since CMC’s upgrade. The Minister specifically directed to clear encroachments on the corporation’s properties and ensure that there are no such encroachments in the future. Highlighting the deficiency in the drinking water supply, MLA Shivaraj Patil appealed to the Urban Development Minister to prepare an action plan to supply an additional 20 MLD of water to the present supply of 52 MLD to meet the growing demand of the 3.20 lakh population.

After bashing endless waves of wicked Nazis in 2022’sSisu, the sequel, also written and directed by Helander, finds our silent commando/prospector, Aatami Korpi (Jorma Tommila), on a new mission. It is 1946 and Korpi heads to his family home in Karelia, which was ceded to the Soviet Union by Finland in 1944. Korpi decides to dismantle the family home, where his wife and young sons were brutally killed by the Soviets, and rebuild it on Finnish soil. He loads up his truck with all the wood from the house (including the kennel) and sets off for the border with his faithful Bedlington Terrier. However, there is evil about: a KGB officer (Richard Brake) releases Igor Draganov (Stephen Lang), the Red Army officer responsible for killing Korpi’s family, from prison in Siberia to hunt and end Korpi’s legend as Koshchei (”the Immortal”). There follows a brutal cross country hunt where Helander’s inspirations from Indiana Jones (the planes, trains, tanks and motorcycle chases do remind one of the Fedora-toting adventurer-archaeologist) and James Bond to Buster Keaton are riotously unleashed. Mika Orasmaa’s cinematography is exquisite, recreating a Commando comic-like look and feel. The shot of the plane going up in the air vertically, causing the propeller to sputter to a stop as the fuel cannot reach it, and then swooping to start again, is breathtaking. As are the shots of the plane flying beside a cliff, or the one of planes flying over a field reminding one of Ridley Scott’s “plane over swimming pool” shot. A still from ‘Sisu: Road to Revenge’

Police erected a barricade at the main gate of Evercare Hospital around 2 a.m., with hospital sources saying more than two dozen personnel have been deployed to regulate patients' movement and reinforce Ms. Zia’s security,The Daily Starnewspaper reported. The 80-year-old Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson Ms. Zia was admitted to the hospital on November 23 after beingdiagnosed with infections affecting her heart and lungs. Four days later, the three-time prime minister was shifted to the coronary care unit after several of her health complications worsened. Her condition deteriorated further, and she was placed on ventilation on Sunday (December 30, 2025) night, BNP vice-chairman advocate Ahmed Aazam Khan said on Monday (December 1, 2025). “She is in a very critical condition.

The face we see is of the writer-director Vikarnan Ashok — able, quirky, and ambitious, but self-doubting. In his debut directorialMask, Vikarnan would’ve hoped that the quirky treatment of his heady crime-thriller story targeting the Gen Zs would mask his insecurities as a debutant filmmaker, but the ruse falls through multiple times. Take, for instance, how overtly the film keeps underlining Kavin’s crooked protagonist Velu’s crookedness and moral standpoint. The writer understands how overdone the ‘white knight Robin Hood’ trope has become in Tamil cinema, and so he understandably writes Velu as an anti-hero, a “kettavan”, but with a moral spine — the character design and how we are taken through what he does for a living are all tastefully delivered in the beginning. He is a hacker, scammer, and blackmailer — with ‘ethical’ as the standard prefix. He’s the spoiled brat son of a hotelier, a money-minded jackal with a talented support team, a conniving detective, and a man who wouldn’t open up about his marital status to a love-interest (Ruhani Sharma) until guilt pricks him. That very introduction sequence to the character and how he gets entangled with the conflict does the job, but somehow, the writer feels compelled to keep repeating dialogues that go “Naan kettavan, aana eccha illa,” or give us a disclaimer every time Velu is about to shed his skin. The same applies to even Andrea’s antagonist, Bhumi, a shady business owner and philanthropist who heads an NGO that protects children from sex slavery, all of whom would someday end up in her sex work outfit.

Sothisis why cinephiles treat him like a minor deity… Adapted fromThe Axby Donald Westlake,No Other Choiceis a surgical takedown of the idea that steady pay checks are a redundant architecture of moralisms. It is also PCW’s funniest, angriest, and most ruthlessly clear-eyed assault on capitalism since his earlier vengeance cycle, and it wears all of its snark and spite like a bespoke rubber onesie. The plot is simple and horrifically specific. Yoo Man-su, played by Lee Byung-hun with a mix of mortified dignity and cartoonish panic, is a paper-industry lifer whose life is scaffolded around his résumé. When American investors buy the firm and cut jobs, Man-su’s comfortable world unravels. Rather than change course, he starts to scheme. To Man-su, losing his job is an axing of identity (or his fragile male ego) that is tantamount to sacrilege. He posts a fake job ad, stalks rivals, and 3D-prints a replacement for his family’s heirloom gun, before the bodies begin to pile up. PCW tracks this descent with a detached amusement that never softens into sympathy for entitlement. But what the veteran Korean auteur refuses to let us forget is how ordinary that logic feels when framed as a ‘survival-of-the-fittest’. A still from ‘No Other Choice’

When the seemingly soft and harmlessRenoirfloated in unsuspectingly enough for me to underestimate it, this quiet little thing turned out to be the sharpest, sleeper special I’d watched all day. Chie Hayakawa, who broke out withPlan 75and its eerily bureaucratic euthanasia scheme, pivots from speculative future to 1987 Tokyo, during the froth of Japan’s bubble years. The premise is simple though its textures are not: eleven-year-old Fuki lives in the suburbs with a father who is slowly dying of cancer and a mother whose work and caregiving leave little energy for anything else. The film premiered in the main competition at Cannes this year before opening at IFFI, and threads its way through that specific late-’80s moment with a melange of personal memory and social observation. Hayakawa has said the project grew out of her own childhood experience of having a sick father and that she deliberately anchored it in the boom-era years because that insulated prosperity rhymed uncomfortably with our present. You feel that double exposure almost immediately. Hospitals and cramped apartments share the frame with bright consumer surfaces, as if the country were trying to wallpaper over illness with pastel flourishes. The opening lays out the film’s method with a small, nasty flourish. Fuki sits alone watching a VHS compilation of crying babies, tosses the tape in the trash room, encounters a stranger whose questions creep from casual to invasive. Later that night, the man appears in her bedroom and kills her. Only then does the film snap back: this is a school assignment, a story Fuki has written with the deranged title “I Want to Be an Orphan.” Her teacher is shaken (but I was in splits). Her mother, called in for an intervention, is annoyed at having her workday interrupted.

Whether you’ve been tracking the dissident Iranian filmmaker since his earliest days or only just sat down for his latest,It Was Just an Accidentis blunt-force cinema at its finest. There’s something irresistibly endearing about this eternal mischief-maker with a camera, moving through the world with a kind of bottomless, almost childlike hunger to keep making films long after any reasonable person would have tapped out. And if theCannes Palme d’Or-winner’s run so far is anything to go by, it’s not just the best film at IFFI, but the best film ateveryfestival it’s touched this year. In the opening scene, Eghbal (Ebrahim Azizi) is hurtling through darkness with his pregnant wife and daughter. A dog darts across the road and is struck. “It was just an accident,” the wife shrugs. That slipperiness of consequence becomes the film’s spine, and the seemingly banal car breakdown outside a modest garage flips into a moral trap. A limp, and the squeak of Eghbal’s prosthetic soon becomes evidence for horrors from the past. Vahid (an incredible Vahid Mobasseri), a car mechanic with a tortured kidney and brutal memories of prison, thinks he’s finally found his tormentor. He abducts “Peg Leg” Eghbal, digs a hole in the desert, and debates whether the slow-motion of justice or rage will prevail. Vahid doesn’t stay a lone wolf for long.

As Glinda is fussed over and coddled at the Emerald City and reminded that she is to keep the spirits of the people of Oz high, Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) is holed up in her forest hideout. The much-anticipated sequel to the hugely successful 2024 musical-fantasy filmWicked, this sequel, directed by Jon M Chu, lands with sky-high expectations attached. The sequel, like the first film - an adaptation of the 2003 stage musicalWickedby Stephen Schwartz and Winnie Holzman - is a revisionist look at the wicked witch that we have come to know from the tale of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, from the 1900 novel by Frank Baum, and the film adaptation, which was released in 1939. We saw Elphaba ride off on her broomstick at the end of the first film, and now, in the forest, she continues to fight for the rights of the animals of Oz. While a slow but steady crackdown was beginning in the first film, the subjugation is driving the animals out of Oz in large numbers. Elphaba’s sister Nessarose Thorpe (Marissa Bode), the new governor of Munchkinland, is also ready to sign off on a law for permits required for animals to travel across borders. Glinda, meanwhile, remains largely unaffected by these changes, flitting around the palace with the Wizard of Oz (Jeff Goldblum) and Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) as she prepares to get married to Winkie prince Fiyero(Jonathan Bailey).

In Jayan Nambiar’s debut directorialVilayath Buddha, one gets a couple of compelling characters caught in not-so-common situations, lending unlikely depth to what is an otherwise run-of-the-mill mass entertainer lacking any novelty. One of the characters happens to be Bhaskaran (Shammi Thilakan), a former teacher and panchayat president, whose calling card is his squeaky-clean image. On the eve of the panchayat elections, that image takes an irredeemable hit. We see him struggling to come to terms with this fall, as it takes a toll on his mental makeup. Before long, the intense wish to repair his image turns into an obsession, at the centre of which is a sandalwood tree, the eponymous Vilayath Buddha, the scent of which he thinks will be his everlasting legacy after his death. Chaithanya (Priyamvada), too, is yearning to dissociate from the bad name that she has inherited as the daughter of a former sex worker. Getting married to Double Mohanan (Prithviraj), a sandalwood smuggler and a local Robin Hood, is her idea of redemption. Her obsession with losing the stain of her background and moving up in life, in a way, prevents Mohanan from moving away from criminality. She acts as a kind of hindrance to him watering down his goonish persona, at times egging him on to more violence. These are the kind of absorbing elements one would not associate with a typical mass entertainer, but the film’s larger-than-life ambitions end up squandering them. GR Indugopan, who wrote the story on which the film is based, along with co-screenwriter Rajesh Pinnadan, banks more on the massy side of things, much of which is familiar recreations from umpteen films of the genre.

His recent choices — includingBlink,KTM, andDasara— signal an intent to avoid typecasting. InBank of Bhagyalakshmi, directed by debutant Abhishek, Dheekshith’s character is meant to be both exaggerated and subtly humorous. His minimalist style — mischievous smile, casual dialogue, nimble body language — brings charm. However, the director’s attempt to intensify scenes involving Dheekshith with monologues feels excessive. Bank of Bhagyalakshmiis a fun watch when it doesn’t take itself seriously. When the story takes a moral route, you sense a detachment from the proceedings. Eventually, the movie treads a familiar path after being genre-specific for the most part. The comedy heist thriller gets rolling when a group of youngsters, led by Kanaka a.k.a. Tiger, decides to loot a bank in a village. They walk in with animal masks, and naturally, each gang member has a code name of an animal. An unexpected hurdle, combined with a lack of Plan B, forces the gang to take hostages of people inside the bank. Director Abhishek throws at you an array of characters, both inside and outside the bank. While the investigative officer (Vishwanath Mandalika) is a stock character, a popular news-focused YouTuber (Gopalkrishna Deshpande) and a “budding journalist” (Bharath GB) help build our curiosity. Inside the bank, there is a content creator (AS Suraj) to lighten your mood and a folk singer (Usha Bhandary) as a calming elderly presence. The bank’s accountant, played by Brinda Acharya, appears as a traditional female lead till the story gives her an interesting arc. The impending elections serve as an added conflict in the plot.

Randhir’s adaptation explores the fragile beauty of love that defied boundaries, much like  cinematic romances of the 1970s, he grew up admiring. “The kind of love we saw inPakeezahorMughal-e-Azamis rarely seen today. People still crave that depth,” he reflects. “I had Meena Kumari’s grace in mind when I conceived this story; it is, in many ways, a tribute to her.” Though the musical’s title reminds of the classicPakeezahstarring Meena Kumari, Randhir explains, “In the 1920s, a kaneez was a woman taken into a household as a maid or a companion. Our protagonist is a tawaif — a performer, not a courtesan by compulsion, but by passion for singing and dance. She’s called a kaneez because she chooses devotion over subjugation.” Balancing sensitivity and spectacle has been at the heart of the production. “We’ve treated the theme of faith and caste with respect,” says Randhir. “Our references to Radha-Krishna and Mughal-era traditions are only symbolic. The play speaks about humanity — of a time when acceptance came more naturally than it does today.” Music as the heartbeat Music forms the emotional core ofKaneez, binding its contrasting worlds — bhajan and mujra — into one continuum of devotion and desire. “The pundit’s son sings bhajans; the tawaif sings thumris. They are divided by faith, but united by music. That was also true of Tanno Bai and Dharikshan Tiwari.” The production features the voices of Shaan, Papon and Javed Ali — each chosen for their distinct tonal depth.

The Helen O’Grady theatre troupe, comprising 20 students from grades 5 to 8 of SM Shetty International School, Powai, will present two contrasting plays: The Sound of Music and The Tempest.
 
 For this team of children, chosen after an audition of 50 participants, the journey has been as significant as the final performance. “We began with a large pool of students and gradually narrowed it down to 20,” says Urvi Thaker, vice president (training) of Helen O’Grady. “Over two and a half months, we worked closely with them, refining character work, stage presence and coordination, to shape the final production.” Urvi and Diptesh Khera, senior trainer at Helen O’Grady International, have been guiding the students through this process, balancing instruction with discovery. The creative team decided early on to keep the staging simple. “We wanted the narrative and performances to take precedence,” says Urvi. “Even without elaborate sets or props, when the characters and dialogue are strong, the play can hold the audience.” The minimalist setting allows the children’s expressions and timing to become the focus, bringing out an understated yet powerful stage presence.

So, he began taking his iPad along on these journeys, creating art on it as he travelled. “These are works I have done when I am travelling on a train,” he says, pointing to the curated selection of some of these artworks, which are currently on the walls of Gallery No. 4 at the Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath, Bengaluru. This exhibition of digital prints, ‘Playing with Life’, a striking blend of both abstraction and representation, which opened to the public on October 30, draws on his half-century-long tryst with theatre. “I am visually driven as a performer, as an actor-trainer,” says the founder of Karnataka’s celebrated amateur theatre group Samudaya and the national president of the Indian People’s Theatre Association (IPTA). “I’ve actually been living the life of a designer in several fields.

Born into a devadasi family sometime around 1870, Balamani Ammal learnt to sing and dance at an early age. It is not known how she took to theatre (though TK Shanmugam mentions her to be a student of Sankaradas Swamigal). Sometime in the 1890s, she, along with her sister Rajambal, began a theatre group called the Edward Theatrical Company, popularly known as the Balamani Drama Company. It was an all-women theatre group, the first of its kind, and comprised disenfranchised and economically underprivileged girls. Balamani Ammal took them under her wing and became their mentor. The troupe staged mostly mythological plays, though Balamani Ammal is credited with being the earliest to take up social themes in Tamil theatre. She performed the first social drama —  Kasi Viswanatha Mudaliar’sDambachari Vilasam. Noted drama teacher and playwright M Kandaswamy Mudaliar (father of actor MK Radha) was associated with  Balamani Ammal’s theatre group as a writer and director for a long time.

Mr. Palekar's counsel, Anil Anturkar, urged a bench of Justices Riyaz Chagla and Farhan Dubash to take up for hearing the petition filed way back in 2016. The petitioner (Palekar) is 85 years old now and wants an outcome, be it positive or negative, to his petition, Mr. Anturkar told the court. The court agreed and said it would hear the plea on December 5. The actor's counsel said the issue is only whether under the provisions of the Bombay Police Act, the police has the authority of pre-censorship of dramas and plays. ""We are now in an era where there is no censorship of shows and series on OTTs,"" Mr. Anturkar said. In September 2017, the High Court had admitted Mr. Palekar's petition but it was never taken up for final hearing since then. Mr. Palekar, in his petition, challenged rules which makes pre-censorship of the scripts of plays mandatory by the Maharashtra State Performance Scrutiny Board. In his plea, the acclaimed actor has said the rules are 'arbitrary' and violative of the fundamental rights of a citizen guaranteed under the Constitution of India. Under Section 33 (1) (wa) of the Bombay Police Act, the Commissioner of Police or Superintendent of Police can frame rules for Licensing and Controlling Places of Public Amusement (other than cinemas) and Performance for Public Amusement, including Melas and Tamashas. By these rules, for regulation in the interest of public order, decency or morality, prior scrutiny of such performances and of the script was made mandatory, after which a certificate would be issued subject to conditions.

The initiative by Manipal Hospital, Kanakapura Road, in partnership with Manipal Foundation, will fund ten complex surgeries that began with the treatment of an eight-year-old boy. The boy, Subhash, who lost his parents during the pandemic, had long suffered from recurring lung infections and severe weight loss due to a rare congenital defect, tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF). Although operated on at birth, the defect recurred silently, severely damaging his left lung.

During an on-site inspection in his Byatarayanapura Assembly constituency, the Minister criticised officials for taking two years to erect a single Metro pillar, a task that, he said, should ideally be completed within two months. Mr. Gowda inspected various stretches of the long-delayed Blue Line corridor, which was initially scheduled for completion in 2025, later revised to 2026, and now pushed to 2027. He questioned officials on the spot about the issues hampering speedy construction, stressing that the project’s sluggish progress was causing severe inconvenience to the public. He highlighted several problems arising from the delay, including deteriorating road conditions, daily traffic congestion, and public frustration. Mr. Gowda said, “Construction debris and unused materials had been dumped carelessly along the alignment, creating additional hurdles for commuters. Flooding during rains has worsened the situation, and there is lack of basic drainage arrangements at the ongoing work sites.” Calling the state of affairs unacceptable, Mr. Gowda directed the BMRCL to expedite the construction and ensure temporary measures were implemented to facilitate smoother traffic movement.

The 90-minute play, performed by three actors, Adithya R, Seema Rajpal, and Shafaque Javed, marks the fourth original production by Negi’stheatre group. It spotlights the lingering effects of post-traumatic stress disorder to the forefront. It opens with a woman meeting someone in a café, though it is never revealed whether that “someone” is a woman, or even alive or dead. Through their conversation, the audience learns she once slapped a person during a job interview — the play unravels what triggered that act and, eventually, the reason behind it. “Through fragmented recollections and blurred boundaries between truth and illusion, the narrative underscores how trauma disrupts perception and resists coherent representation,” says Negi.

Kimberly wants her father to get into the holiday spirit, and invites people to John’s house to celebrate the festive season. When a blizzard strikes, all of them get snowed in together, leading to heart-warming and comedic exchanges. John, is the archetypical grinch. But he was not always like this. He used to be a fan of the festive season — his house would shine with lights, decorations, and decked up trees, and his doors were always open to friends and strangers. Circumstances changed him.

At a Ranga Namana (theatrical tribute) organised by Rangayana, Kalaburagi, the institution’s director Sujatha Jangamashetti recalled Talikoti (born Rajesab Muktumasab Talikoti) as “a true representative of North Karnataka’s earthy dialect and spirit”. “We were appointed directors of different Rangayanas at the same time. Despite initial criticism, he remained cheerful and shared his dreams for Dharwad Rangayana with infectious enthusiasm. His death is an irreparable loss to Kannada professional theatre,” she said. Talikoti, who passed away on Monday following a heart attack he suffered on Sunday night during shooting, rose from humble beginnings. A Class IV dropout and former truck driver, he went on to become a household name through company dramas such as Kaliyugada Kuduka. Joint Director, Department of Kannada and Culture, Basavaraj Hoogar remembered him as an actor who could enthrall audiences with his natural acting despite the limitations of commercial theatre. “He brought theatre closer to common people,” he said. The former Rangayana Director Prabhakar Joshi said that the passing of such a creative mind has left a deep void in Kannada theatre. “Being appointed Director of Dharwad Rangayana was a remarkable achievement for someone who began in company drama,” he noted. Bidar-based theatre artist Vijaykumar Sone observed that hundreds earned their livelihood through Talikoti’s theatre company. “Lakhs have paid tributes online, showing how deeply he was loved,” he said.

In Hyderabad for an Indo-Italian collaborative performance, she reflects on changing cities, changing memories and the nostalgia. Her troupe’s performance, backed by Telangana Tourism, will be staged at Shilpakala Vedika on November 21. The performance, she says, is called ‘Meanwhile, Elsewhere’. “It is inspired by Italio Calvino’s bookInvisible Cities,a favourite book of mine from the time I was 18. The person who has created the show is the artistic director of Darpana called Yadavan Chandran. We have been co-creating for over 25 years, and I have been telling him for years how exciting and relevant this book is; how it can be interpreted in so many ways and inspire. And yet, he never got around to reading it. Then, on November 1, his birthday, he walked into a bookshop in Thiruvananthapuram, and the entire display wasInvisible Cities. So here we are,” she says. Ms. Sarabhai recalls dancing in Hyderabad from the ”very beginning” of her career, “must be in ’79 or ’80,” when the city was ”different”. She reflects on how one of the cities explored in the performance is “a city of memories”, prompting questions about what truly makes a memory and what makes Hyderabad “Hyderabad” anymore. “We are sitting in a part of Hyderabad that has very little to do with Hyderabad,” she says, asking what the city’s core means to each of us. The production examines this through 12 cities — their names and central idea borrowed from Calvino, but “nothing else is”. Everything beyond that is imagined by the director, “who has also written it, also lit it”, she adds. She speaks of the challenges and possibilities of storytelling without speech: “How do you tell the story of destruction without a single word, through dance?” She points to the feeling of returning after a year away and no longer recognising the city, raising questions of wh",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/mallika-sarabhais-shifting-cities-act-set-for-hyderabad-stage-on-nov-21/article70299808.ece

Khandre, Minister for Forests, Ecology and Environment, inaugurated the Divisional Command and Control Centre of M.M. Hills Forest Division on December 3. He said that advanced technologies will be harnessed to reduce human-animal conflict. The Minister said forest degradation and increase in wildlife population was contributing to a surge in human–wildlife conflict in recent years and only the use of state-of-the-art technology combined with a spirit of coexistence can help manage it. Establishing Integrated Command and Control Centres was one of the suggestions adopted by the government in the wake of an increase in conflicts; tiger attacks led to the deaths of three farmers in Saragur taluk of Mysuru district last month. The Minister said increasing foot patrolling and creating awareness among communities living on the forest fringes about co-existence can help reduce conflicts. The establishment of the command centre is a step in this direction, he added. Command centres have been established in four locations including Nagarhole, M.M. Hills, Kali, and Madikeri. Training has been provided to staff. ‘’Steps are being taken to open command centres in the Chikkamagaluru division where conflict is high, apart from Bannerghatta National Park, Mysuru division, Bandipur Tiger Reserve, Biligiri Ranganathaswamy Tiger Reserve, and the Hassan range as well. This will be supplemented by a State-level command centre which is being established in Bengaluru,’’ said Mr. Khandre, who expressed confidence of its inauguration after the Assembly session. Officials were instructed to use Artificial Intelligence cameras, thermal drone cameras, and similar technologies to monitor wildlife movement and provide real-time alerts on the presence of animals close to villages on the forest periphery.

When asked about what it is like to work with the Gen Z, the founder ofChennai Kalai Kuzhu, a group which began 40 years ago, Pralayan admits in jest that the “boomer uncles” and those perceived as older, cease to have a vocabulary that can engage with them in depth. Yet, his belief in a fundamental truth, sets him free. “I know that they are attracted to the truth,” he says. In his consistent attempt at this truth telling, something that has sustained his theatre troupe through times in the 1980s when sedition cases against theatre artistes by the Tamil Nadu government were rife, he brings to the world his new play starring actor Rohini in the lead. Vanapechitells the tale of Thadagai from the Hindu epicRamayana. In Valmiki’s version of the tale, she is arakshasi, a monster or a witch. She is slayed by the hero of this tale, Rama. Yet, Pralayan subverts this narrative. “This story is told from Thadagai’s lens. She is a metaphor for Nature. In the epic, she is ‘disfigured’ or ‘distorted’ by Rama. This is an injustice to someone who merely wanted to protect the forest. The play, in the urban context, speaks about the steady disfiguration of Nature. We need to act now as climate change is steadily becoming an urgent global concern. It hopes to make the audience rethink our most fundamental questions -- who are we and where are we headed,” he says. The crew from Vanapechi

However, the climate crisis is still largely seen as a future issue, or one that affects others, not us.” The team’s intention was to create a play, Meghana says, “that can help people see themselves as deeply implicated in the climate crisis, but also as a key part of the climate solution”. She explains how making theatre is always a process of putting out 100 fires. “An apt metaphor for a play about the climate. The biggest challenge, however, was the script, as we were determined to balance the informational load with the entertainment and storytelling that is at the core of the story.” It was important for Meghana to underline the seriousness of rising temperatures while keeping the tone of the play light and satirical. “I strongly believe that the playfulness of the tone can allow us to engage more deeply with difficult topics, and I hope we have struck that ",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/mumbais-tafreehwale-brings-its-climate-centric-play-fever-dream-to-bengaluru-this-month/article70162109.ece

Presented at the Museum Theatre, the production stepped away from MMA’s usual concert-format performances and moved towards a full narrative musical — with choreography, story arcs and character-driven solos. The story followed the familiar outline, but the tone was distinctly contemporary. Instead of orchestral scores, the emotional landscape unfolded through pop music, spanning nearly five decades. What could have felt like a collage of unrelated hits, instead came together with surprising coherence. Whether it was the playful ‘Material Girl’ or tender ‘Can’t Help Falling in Love’, each song carried its scene just right. Music direction by Augustine Paul held the production together with a steady through-line. The role of Ella was played by Adeline Cynthia, who performed the character without exaggeration or the fairy-tale sweetness. Her interpretation felt grounded, as though Ella was a young woman navigating difficult circumstances with a quiet resilience. Her scenes with Abraham Matthew, who played Prince Walton, were understated and natural, particularly, in the second act when the pacing eased and the emotional exchanges were given space.

The Indian government has confidentially ordered companies including Apple, Samsung and Xiaomi to preload their phones with an app called Sanchar Saathi, or Communication Partner, within 90 days. The app is intended to track stolen phones, block them and prevent them from being misused. The government also wants manufacturers to ensure that the app is not disabled. And for devices already in the supply chain, manufacturers should push the app to phones via software updates, Reuters was first to report on Monday. India’s telecom ministry confirmed the move later, describing it as a security measure to combat “serious endangerment” of cyber security. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s political opponents and privacy advocates criticized the move, saying it is a way for the government to gain access to India’s 730 million smartphones. In the wake of the criticism, India’s telecom minister Jyotiraditya M. Scindia on Tuesday said the app was a “voluntary and democratic system,”adding that users can choose to activate it and can “easily delete it from their phone at any time.” At present, the app can be deleted by users. Scindia did not comment on or clarify the November 28 confidential directive that ordered smartphone makers to start preloading it and ensure “its functionalities are not disabled or restricted.” Apple however does not plan to comply with the directive and will tell the government it does not follow such mandates anywhere in the world as they raise a host of privacy and security issues for the company’s iOS ecosystem, said two of the industry sources who are familiar with Apple’s concerns.

The brand is pitching these as wireless headphones for people who want everything: high-resolution audio, a neutral tone, massive battery life, uncompromised ANC, and the freedom to ditch cables entirely. Even before the India launch, the HDB 630 had already built global buzz among audiophiles, often compared to Sony’s WH-1000XM6 in early discussions. I’ve been testing the headphone extensively, and while it might not be perfect for a few, it stands out as one of Sennheiser’s most mature wireless efforts yet. Sennheiser keeps things minimalist with the HDB 630, but the execution is striking. The smaller earcups instantly make these feel more compact than the Momentum 4, without compromising comfort. The use of refined Ideatex protein-leatherette across the headband and pads adds a level of sophistication you notice the moment you pick them up. The clamping force is intentionally moderated, tight enough to seal in bass, gentle enough for long sessions. This is a design that prioritizes pure, uncoloured sound reproduction. The balance between the headband and earcups, combined with lightweight internals, gives these an ergonomic footprint similar to studio headphones. The Japanese leatherette wrap on the headband feels premium yet breathable, and during long listening days, the HDB 630 never became fatiguing. It’s an understated design, but premium in all the ways that matter. Sennheiser has built its most significant control upgrade yet inside the HDB 630, a full Parametric Equalizer inside the Smart Control Plus app. This is not the usual 5-band EQ every consumer headphone offers. You can target exact frequencies, widen or narrow the bandwidth, choose filter types, and shape sound with the kind of precision normally reserved for desktop software.

1605,2025,The Hindu,1605,"Why Microsoft’s AI is being criticised | ExplainedPremium The story so far:On November 10, the President for Microsoft’s Windows + Devices (W+D) business, Pavan Davuluri, spotlighted new AI features in Windows and invited users to a digital session as part of Microsoft’s Ignite event. What should have been a fairly standard company update posted on the social media platform X instead received hundreds of comments, many of them negative, and over a million views before the comment section was locked down. These vehement reactions to theMicrosoft executive’s announcement revealed a sharp split between the software giant’s AI roadmap and its customers’ demands. As Microsoft introduced new AI features over the following days, the negative comments only grew. Along with a link to a company session about Windows, Microsoft 365 Copilot, secure AI, and agent productivity, Mr. Davuluri posted, “Windows is evolving into an agentic OS, connecting devices, cloud, and AI to unlock intelligent productivity and secure work anywhere. Join us at #MSIgnite to see how frontier firms are transforming with Windows and what’s next for the platform. We can’t wait to show you!” What appeared to trigger many users online was the comment about Windows becoming an agentic operating system (OS), or an AI-powered system on a device capable of processing natural language commands and taking autonomous actions for its users. Since 2023, Microsoft has invested heavily in Generative AI, first by financially backing ChatGPT-maker OpenAI before developing its own AI offerings as the distance between the two companies grew. Microsoft’s AI, or “chat-based generative AI interaction” that it calls Copilot, serves a variety of use cases, ranging from browsing online and maximising productivity to generating multimedia and summarising/correcting your content. Whether a Microsoft customer is using Windows as their OS, Edge as their browser, Outlook for their mail needs, or a Surface PC for their tasks, Copilot is already present or easy to access.

Starting at ₹72,999, iQOO 15 features the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset for top-grade performance and gaming. It boasts of iQOO’s largest vapour chamber cooling system, a massive 7,000 mAh battery with 100W fast charging, and a stunning 6.85-inch M14 2K 144 Hz ultra-bright AMOLED display. Competing strongly with the Realme GT 8 Pro and OnePlus 15, the iQOO 15 stands out for its advanced Q3 gaming chip with ray tracing and immersive 4D dual-axis vibration motor, making it a formidable contender in the sub-₹75,000. Let’s dive deeper to see if the iQOO 15 lives up to the hype and secures its place among 2025’s top flagships or not. The iQOO 15 builds on the design language of the iQOO 13 but sharpens the aesthetic with cleaner transitions and a bolder identity. The Legend variant, which I reviewed, uses a glass back with a fresh interpretation of the tri-colour pattern. It’s an elegant touch that gives the phone an instantly recognisable character. The frame feels tighter, the curves more controlled, and the hand-feel is more refined than last year’s model. At 8.17mm and 220g, the Legend variant isn’t the lightest phone in its class (the Alpha Black variant trims it slightly to 216g), but the weight distribution is excellent. The in-hand feel is premium and well-balanced, not slab-like. Compared to the OnePlus 15, which leans into a more industrial and compact feel, the iQOO 15 feels slightly broader but more substantial. Against the Realme GT 8 Pro, it feels more refined and less experimental, especially since Realme is busy tryingmodular camera bumps this year. iQOO 15 design

1610,2025,The Hindu,1610,"Samsung unveils first multi-folding phone as competition set to heat up Samsung Electronics unveiled on Tuesday its first multi-folding smartphone, in a bid to strengthen its position in a sector of the phone market where competition is expected to intensify. The launch of the Galaxy Z TriFold marks Samsung’s bid to reinforce its footing in a segment where Chinese rivals have been gaining ground,even as analysts say the high price and production challenges mean foldable devices are likely to remain a niche category for now. The model, priced at about 3.59 million won ($2,440.17), unfolds into a 253.1 millimetre (10-inch) display, using three panels and it is nearly 25% larger than Samsung’s latest foldable Galaxy Z Fold 7 model. “I believe the foldable market will continue to grow, and the TriFold in particular could act as a catalyst that drives more explosive growth in key parts of the segment,” said Alex Lim, Samsung Electronics Executive Vice President and head of the Korea Sales & Marketing Office. Lim said the new foldable device is intended for customers who specifically want it, rather than as a volume driver. The TriFold, produced in South Korea, will go on sale domestically on December 12 and be rolled out in China, Singapore, Taiwan and the United Arab Emirates within this year. The U.S. launch is expected as early as the first quarter of next year. The device features Samsung’s largest battery in its flagship models and supports super-fast charging that powers the phone to 50% in 30 minutes. Lim said memory chips and other component costs have been rising sharply, making pricing a “difficult decision”. Analysts said the TriFold is more likely to be a showcase of the new technology rather than a volume-driving flagship. “The trifold is a first-generation product, and it’s the first time a trifold design is being commercialised, so it’s hard to see Samsung pushing large volumes at this stage,” said Ryu Young-ho, a senior analyst at NH Investment & Securities.

1613,2025,The Hindu,1613,"Buying a laptop under ₹20,000 — Here’s what you need to know If you had a budget of ₹20,000 and wanted to buy a device to support both your work and personal needs, you might have once looked at mid-range tablets and high-end phones. In recent years, however, multiple laptops have joined this list, allowing you to bring home a new PC—with some cash to spare. Some of the brands offering laptops that cost ₹20,000 or less include Primebook, Lenovo, Ultimus, Jio, Walker, and Acer. What are the benefits of investing in entry-level laptops and what are the trade-offs? Let’s take a look. Budget laptops are well-suited to the needs of new tech users, children, seniors, and users who only want basic computing and internet browsing features. They can serve as portable, low-cost educational tools to help these users practice basic computer skills such as making presentations and conducting research, while the entry-level specs also discourage activities such as binge-watching content online and playing games. This is a definite win for parents and teachers. Entry-level laptops are well suited to commutes and travel. Due to their smaller size, they can fit into the bags of bikers and are also convenient when the user is working within buses, trains, and planes. Users also do not have to worry about losing a luxury device during airport or train station security checks. Another point to take into consideration is that more laptops, even those in the entry-level segment, are now designed to support the use of AI chatbots; users can enjoy access to cutting-edge technology while saving money with a less costly device. Coming to memory, users can expect between 4 GB and 8 GB of RAM, which should serve the needs of most customers. Entry-level laptops do come with glaring limitations, related to both their hardware and software. A computer user who is, for example, picky about the kind of word processing software they use or their OS updates, is better off exploring more advanced PC options. However, PC users who are agnostic when it comes to w",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/buying-a-laptop-under-20000-heres-what-you-need-to-know/article70329555.ece

And if you’ve seen the X200 series, you’ll know exactly what I mean. With every generation, Vivo has pushed the boundaries of what mobile photography can be, and with the X300, the company takes an even more confident leap. Positioned squarely in the ₹70,000–₹80,000 flagship segment, it arrives to challenge theOnePlus 15, Realme GT 8 Pro, and iQOO 15 head-on. It’s a crowded space, but if one thing is clear from the outset: the Vivo X300 is here with intent. The question is obvious, does it have what it takes to stand tall? The compactness of the Vivo X300 is the first thing that strikes you. It feels refreshing in a world where flagships keep getting larger. The 6.31-inch footprint makes it incredibly easy to handle, and the slim 7.99mm profile paired with a 190g weight ensures effortless usability throughout the day. Vivo’s Coral Velvet Glass technique elevates the tactile experience, understated, silky, resistant to fingerprints, and refined in a way that feels polished but never flashy. I particularly liked the Mist Blue variant; under bright light, it often appears white, shifting beautifully with changing reflections, adding a subtle sense of luxury.

India is one of the world's largest telephone markets, with more than 1.2 billion subscribers, and government figures show the app, launched in January, has helped recover more than 700,000 lost phones, including 50,000 in October alone. Apple, which has previously locked horns with the telecoms regulator over development of a government anti-spam mobile app, is among the companies, such as Samsung, Vivo, Oppo and Xiaomi bound by the new order. The November 28 order, seen by Reuters, gives major smartphone companies 90 days to ensure that the government's Sanchar Saathi app is pre-installed on new mobile phones, with a provision that users cannot disable it. For devices already in the supply chain, manufacturers should push the app to phones via software updates, the ministry said in its order, which was not made public and was sent privately to select companies. The government said the app was essential to combat ""serious endangerment"" of telecom cyber security from duplicate or spoofed IMEI numbers, which enable scams and network misuse.

Most were loyal supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump, who carried their home of Montour County by 20 percentage points in the 2024 election. But they bristled at Washington’s push to fast-track artificial intelligence infrastructure, which has driven data-centre growth in rural areas around the U.S. where land is cheap. On a recent November evening, residents in this county of 18,000 people stepped to the microphone, questioning Talen Energy officials about how their planned data centre might raise residents’ utility bills, reduce working farmland, and strain local water and natural resources. “Say no to rezoning, so water keeps flowing and crops keep growing,” two women sang in a riff on Woody Guthrie’s folk song “This Land Is Your Land.” Political leaders across the U.S. are urging a rapid expansion of data-centre capacity and new power production to keep the country competitive in AI. Trump, a Republican, is promoting the build-out as an economic and national security priority and has directed his administration to bypass environmental rules and permitting that give local communities a voice. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro and Republican Senator Dave McCormick are courting developers with incentives and infrastructure upgrades to attract investment in the fast-growing industry. Some communities welcome the economic boost. But the backlash in Montour County, nestled in central Pennsylvania, reflects a growing coalition of farmers, environmentalists and homeowners who have united across partisan lines to resist data-centre expansion.

On 28 November 2025, the Department of Telecommunications ordered all handset manufacturers and importers to pre-install the Sanchar Saathi application on every phone intended for the Indian market, ensuring the app is visible and functional from first boot. Devices already manufactured or already in circulation must receive the app via software updates, with manufacturers given 90 days to comply and 120 days to submit formal adherence reports. Also read |Sanchar Saathi app row: Snooping will never happen, says Scindia in Lok Sabha The initiative itself, launched in May 2023, is presented as a consumer-protection measure: a tool to verify whether a device’s IMEI is genuine, to block cloned or blacklisted identifiers, to report stolen phones, and to flag potential telecom fraud. The government argues that unchecked IMEI tampering and the illegal resale of stolen phones harm both telecom security and consumers. In isolation, these aims appear benign. But what appears on paper as an anti-fraud initiative is, in practice, a compulsory state-owned software layer embedded deep into a user’s phone. This raises profound concerns about privacy, consent, and expanding surveillance power. Unlike voluntary device-tracking frameworks such as Apple’s Find My or Android’s Find Hub, Sanchar Saathi does not offer users a choice. Find My and Find Hub are opt-in services that individuals enable if they wish to locate lost or stolen devices, relying on Bluetooth, encrypted communication, and crowdsourced networks capable of detecting devices even when offline.

Those in favour of the world-first December 10 ban point to a growing mass of studies that suggest too much time online takes a toll on teen wellbeing. But opponents argue there is not enough hard proof to warrant the new legislation, which could do more harm than good. Adolescent brains are still developing into the early 20s, said psychologist Amy Orben, who leads a digital mental health programme at the University of Cambridge. A ""huge amount"" of observational research, often based on surveys, has tracked a correlation between teen tech use and worse mental health, she told AFP. But it is hard to draw firm conclusions, because phones are so ingrained into daily life, and young people may turn to social media because they are already suffering. ""With technology, because it's changing so fast, the evidence base will always be uncertain,"" Orben said. ""What could change the dial are experimental studies or evaluations of natural experiments. So evaluating the Australia ban is hugely important because it actually gives us a window on what might be happening."" To try and shed light on the cause-and-effect relationship, Australian researchers are recruiting 13- to 16-year-olds for a ""Connected Minds Study"" to assess how the ban affects their wellbeing. A World Health Organization survey last year found that 11 percent of adolescents struggled to control their use of social media. Other research has shown a link between excessive social media use and poor sleep, body image, school performance and emotional distress, such as a 2019 study of US schoolchildren in JAMA Psychiatry that found those who spent over three hours a day on social media could be at heightened risk for mental health problems.

Kress’ comments add to intensifying discussion around a partnership that ties two of the most significant players in the artificial intelligence race and is at the center of rising concerns around circular deals in the AI ecosystem. The world’s most valuable company in September unveiled a letter of intent to invest in OpenAI, under an agreement that would involve deploying at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems for the startup, enough capacity to power more than 8 million U.S. homes. “We still haven’t completed a definitive agreement, but we’re working with them,” Kress said, addressing questions about the framework of Nvidia’s agreement with OpenAI. OpenAI, the startup at the heart of the generative AI boom that kicked off with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, is a major customer for Nvidia’s chips, alongside large cloud providers which make up a large portion of the chipmaker’s sales. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said the company has $500 billion in bookings for its advanced chips through 2026. The chips Nvidia could provide to OpenAI after its agreement is finalized are not included in these bookings and would add to the number, Kress said on Tuesday. “That half a trillion doesn’t include any of the work that we’re doing right now on the next part of the agreement with OpenAI,” she said. Nvidia shares were up 2.6%. Over the past year, Nvidia has struck a series of deals with AI startups and invested in firms that are also major customers, stoking Wall Street concerns about an AI bubble and so-called circular deals. Nvidia last month announced plans to commit up to $10 billion to OpenAI rival Anthropic. Kress said the Anthropic deal could also add to Nvidia’s $500 billion in chip bookings.",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/nvidia-cfo-says-chipmaker-yet-to-finalise-100-billion-openai-deal/article70351945.ece
1621,2025,The Hindu,1621,"YouTube says it will comply with Australia's teen social media ban Google’s YouTube shared a “disappointing update” to millions of Australian users and content creators on Wednesday, saying it will comply with a world-first teen social media ban by locking out users aged under 16 from their accounts within days. The decision ends a stand-off between the internet giant and the Australian government which initially exempted YouTube from the age restriction, citing its use for educational purposes. Google had said it was getting legal advice about how to respond to being included. “Viewers must now be 16 or older to sign into YouTube,” the company said in a statement. “This is a disappointing update to share. This law will not fulfill its promise to make kids safer online and will, in fact, make Australian kids less safe on YouTube.” The Australian ban is being closely watched by other jurisdictions considering similar age-based measures, setting up a potential global precedent for how the mostly U.S. tech giants behind the biggest platforms balance child safety with access to digital services. The Australian government says the measure responds to mounting evidence that platforms are failing to do enough to protect children from harmful content. YouTube said any user aged under 16 would be automatically signed out of their account from December 10, meaning they could no longer subscribe, like or comment on posts although they could still view content logged out. That meant underage content creators also could not log in or post. YouTube did not say how it would verify someone’s age. The company also reiterated its position that the ban would not make the internet safer, and said in an email to caregivers of underage users that“parental controls only work when your pre-teen or teen is signed in, so the settings you’ve chosen will no longer apply”. Communications Minister Anika Wells, speaking to reporters in Canberra, said it was “weird that YouTube is always at pains to remind us all how unsafe their platform is in a logged out state",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/youtube-says-it-will-comply-with-australias-teen-social-media-ban/article70351931.ece
1622,2025,The Hindu,1622,"Anthropic plans an IPO as early as 2026: Report Anthropic, the artificial intelligence startup backed by Alphabet’s Google and Amazon.com,has hired the law firm Wilson Sonsini to prepare for an initial public offering that could take place as early as 2026, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday. Wilson Sonsini and Anthropic did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for a comment. An IPO would give the company a more efficient way to raise capital and provide leverage for bigger acquisitions through public stock. The move comes as AI adoption gains pace, driven by higher enterprise tech spending and growing investor appetite. Claude maker Anthropic could be prepared to list in 2026, according to the report. The AI startup has also discussed with major investment banks about a potential IPO, the newspaper said, citing people with knowledge of the discussions. The FT report said, however, that the talks are in early stages and informal, indicating the company is still far from selecting its IPO underwriters. “It’s fairly standard practice for companies operating at our scale and revenue level to effectively operate as if they are publicly traded companies,” an Anthropic spokesperson told FT. “We haven’t made any decisions about when or even whether to go public, and don’t have any news to share at this time.” Anthropic is negotiating a private funding round that could give the AI startup a valuation exceeding $300 billion, the report said. Microsoft-backed OpenAI is preparing for what could rank among the largest initial public offerings ever, with a potential valuation of up to $1 trillion. The company is laying the groundwork to go public and may file with securities regulators as early as the second half of 2026, Reuters has reported.

1623,2025,The Hindu,1623,"Women don fake mustaches in LinkedIn 'gender bias' fight Flipping their gender setting to ""male"" and even posting photos with fake mustaches, a growing number of women on LinkedIn have posed a provocative challenge to what they allege is an algorithmic bias on the platform. Last month, female users began claiming that adopting a male identity had dramatically boosted their visibility on the professional networking site, setting off a chain reaction. Women adopted male aliases, Simone became Simon, swapped their pronouns for he/him, and even deployed AI to rewrite old posts with testosterone-laden jargon to cultivate what they describe as an attention-grabbing alpha persona. To add a dash of humor, some women uploaded profile photos of themselves sporting stick-on mustaches. The result? Many women said their reach and engagement on LinkedIn soared, with once-quiet comment sections suddenly buzzing with activity. ""I changed my pronouns and accidentally broke my own LinkedIn engagement records,"" wrote London-based entrepreneur and investor Jo Dalton, adding that the change boosted her reach by 244 percent. ""So here I am, in a stick-on moustache, purely in the interest of science to see if I can trick the algorithm into thinking I am a man."" When a female AFP reporter changed her settings to male, LinkedIn's analytics data showed the reach of multiple posts spiked compared to a week earlier. The posts cumulatively garnered thousands more impressions compared to the previous week. Malin Frithiofsson, chief executive of the Sweden-based Daya Ventures, said the LinkedIn experiment reflected ""gendered discrepancies"" that professional women have felt for years. ""We're at a point where women are changing their LinkedIn gender to male, swapping their names and profile photos, even asking AI to rewrite their bios as 'if a man wrote them,'"" Frithiofsson said. ""And their reach skyrockets."" LinkedIn rejected accusations of in-built sexism.

""There is reason to suspect that their illegal content reporting mechanisms are not easy to access or user-friendly, do not allow people to report child sexual abuse material anonymously... and that the design of their interfaces may deter people from reporting content as illegal,"" said Digital Services Commissioner John Evans. Those issues represented a failure to comply with the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA), a landmark online content law imposed in December 2023, he added. Under the DSA, which tightened the rules for big tech platforms operating within the EU, both companies could in theory face fines of up to six percent of their global annual revenues. While the European Commission is responsible for most regulation under the DSA, national watchdogs bear some responsibility for platforms based in their jurisdictions. Both LinkedIn and TikTok are based in Ireland, which had already opened a probe into Elon Musk's X on November 12 over the platform's moderation practices.

Why pay $30/seat/month for over bundled SaaS when soon even non-tech ops ppl can vibe-code a custom solution in a weekend?” Mr. Tan had tweeted. In turn, Mr. Vembu questioned why legitimate vibe coded email or spreadsheet or accounting apps weren’t already being used instead. “My own personal R&D project is to enable huge gains in programmer productivity by combining compiler technology with AI. Our goal is to enable a quantum leap in programmer productivity while being able to provide security, privacy and compliance guarantees. Without those guarantees, vibe coding just piles up tech debt faster and faster until the whole thing collapses,” he went on. Mr. Vembu then took a shot at Mr. Tan, claiming that for people like him, tech debt is to be “pawned off on unsuspecting acquirers.” He bet that Zoho would surpass vibe coding companies. Multiple users agreed with Mr. Vembu’s sentiment, saying Zoho’s offerings were valuable and available at an affordable price for smaller businesses.

In its ‘Review of Working ofInsolvency and Bankruptcy Codeand Emerging Issues’ report submitted to Parliament on Tuesday, the Standing Committee on Finance said that the efficacy of the IBC can be seen in the fact that a total of 1,194 companies have been successfully resolved under the its framework. It added that creditors have recovered over 170% of the liquidation value and more than 93% of the fair value of these companies. “Despite these undeniable successes, the Committee express profound concern over persistent and systemic challenges that significantly undermine the Code’s optimal performance,” the report said. “These challenges include protracted delays in proceedings, an excessive burden of litigation straining adjudicating authorities, contentious issues surrounding excessive haircuts for creditors, and the incomplete implementation of key frameworks, specifically the individual insolvency framework and the pre-packaged mechanism for MSMEs,” it added. The report further said that the Committee particularly took note of the fact that the slow admission of insolvency applications continues to impede rapid value realisation and leads to the deterioration of assets, and also significantly leads to delays in resolution. The Committee did note that a lot of the shortcomings of the IBC process have been sought to be addressed in the government’s Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Bill 2025.

Maruti Suzuki Executive Director, Corporate Affairs, Rahul Bharti fired back at Tata Motors and Mahindra, dismissing their letter to Union Power Minister Manohar Lal Khattar branding proposed weight-based emission exemptions as “arbitrary”. He called their claims “incorrect facts and narratives irresponsibly pushed by makers of gas guzzlers.” “I wish they took a national view rather than the view of their company,” Mr Bharti said during an online press meet to declare monthly sales figures. The remarks are over the draft Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE)-3 framework which has driven a rift in the auto industry. Under the proposed framework brought out by Bureau of Energy Efficiency in late September, it  seeks tightening fleet-average CO₂ emissions from 113 grams/km to 91.7 grams/km. The draft also includes a relaxation for petrol cars weighing 909 kg or less, measuring under four metres, and equipped with engines up to 1,200 cc which will get a 3g/km relaxation in their CO2 numbers. It is this weight based reduction introduced at the behest of Maruti that several auto players have opposed claiming that it will “alter the level playing field”. But Mr Bharti asserted that protecting small, affordable cars is consistent with global best practices. “The governments of 90% of the world automobile market, including China, US, Europe, Japan, Korea provide structured relaxations for small cars. Are we saying the governments of all these countries are arbitrary”. China offers benefits below 1,090 kg, Europe below 1,115 kg, Korea below 1,100 kg and Japan follows a parabolic curve that eases CO2 compliance for smaller vehicles.

On a normal day, the airport handles between 80,000 and 90,000 passengers. The chain reaction began late on Tuesday night after an IndiGo flight to Bengaluru, scheduled to depart at 11.45 p.m., was repeatedly delayed. When boarding was finally completed around 5 a.m., passengers were asked to deplane. Many refused, demanding answers. “The passengers had to be taken off the aircraft, but they simply refused to get down. That was when CISF personnel had to intervene,” said a source with direct knowledge of the incident. The pilot declined to operate the flight, citing “crew legality”, forcing the airline to cancel it. A group of Ayyappa Swamy devotees heading to Sabarimala in Kerala staged a sit-in at the gates.

1639,2025,The Hindu,1639,"HC directs Cochin Devaswom Board to refrain from engaging security personnel wearing ‘inappropriate attire’ in temples The Kerala High Court on Wednesday directed the Cochin Devaswom Board (CDB) to refrain from engaging personnel wearing inappropriate attire, including T-shirts bearing the word “bouncer,” for security during temple festivals or within the temple precincts. This followed a petition filed recently by N. Prakash, a devotee, challenging the practice of engaging bouncers to control devotees at the Sree Poornathrayeesa temple, Thripunithura, in connection with the ‘Vrischikotsavam’. He said that in all the previous years, sufficient police personnel used to be deputed to control the huge crowd inside the temple, besides volunteers from the devotees. But this time during the fete from November 22 to 25, the board engaged 15 bouncers, citing insufficient number of police personnel. He contended that these people were wearing T-shirts emblazoned with the word bouncer, a term ordinarily associated with personnel deployed outside bars and similar establishments as strong-arm security staff. This was wholly inappropriate and fundamentally incompatible with the sanctity and cultural ethos of the temple environment. The CDB submitted that 10 days prior to the commencement of the festival, a substantial number of members of the Temple Advisory Committee tendered their resignations. The temple had earlier engaged ex-servicemen as security personnel. However, owing to the enormous and unmanageable crowds that thronged the temple, they were unable to effectively regulate ‘devotee movement.’ It was in these compelling circumstances that the security agency was engaged. Stating as ‘unfortunate’ that individuals wearing T-shirts emblazoned with the word bouncer were deployed during the festival, the board went on to assure the court that such an incident would not recur in future, and that the CDB will ensure that necessary decorum is maintained in all temple-related arrangements. The court disposed of the petition, with the directive to the board.",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/hc-directs-cochin-devaswom-board-to-refrain-from-engaging-security-personnel-wearing-inappropriate-attire-in-temples/article70354216.ece

Data on the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation showed that growth in the index was last lower than the latest figures in August 2024, when it had come in at 0%. The electricity sector contracted 6.9% in October 2025, compared with a growth of 2% in October last year. The consumer non-durables sector contracted 4.4% compared with a growth of 2.8% over the same period. “Consumer goods registered negative growth, and the inventory factor would have played out,” Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at the Bank of Baroda said. “It was -0.5% for durables and -4.4% for non-durables. This would need to be monitored for the next two months where traction in a positive direction should be seen.” The mining and quarrying sector contracted 1.8% in October 2025, with the sector contracting in six out of the last seven months.

BIF is an industry group which has WhatsApp and its parent firm Meta as members. Neither company has issued any statement on the mandate. BIF’s statement said the DoT’s order, aimed at curbing fraudulent use of Indian numbers by people abroad who don’t physically possess the Indian SIM with which their WhatsApp account is registered, was “well-intentioned,” but that it raised “significant questions of jurisdiction, proportionality, and consumer impact.” The directions “risk creating obligations that extend far beyond the mandate of the Telecom Act or the purpose of the Telecom Cyber Security Rules,” the statement said, referring to the Telecommunications Act, 2023, and the Telecom Cyber Security Rules, 2024, which were amended in November, preceding the WhatsApp SIM binding order. “The Telecommunications Act does not authorise the regulation of OTT communication platforms, nor does it provide the legislative basis to impose telecom-style operational mandates upon them,” BIF said. The Ministry of Communications had informally assured stakeholders in 2023 that the definition of “telecommunication,” though apparently broad, would not be wielded against applications, which typically reside on the application layer. The 2024 rules’ amendment last month, though, introduced the concept of a Telecommunication Identifier User Entity (TIUE), a broad category that includes any firm using phone numbers to identify their customers. The order would hit non-resident Indians badly, BIF said: “Ordinary use cases such as travellers and NRIs who rely on Wi-Fi to use their Indian numbers abroad, professionals who depend on uninterrupted web-client access during an 8-10 hour workday, families and multi-SIM users who routinely separate their primary SIM from their messaging numb",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/dots-whatsapp-sim-binding-mandate-faces-pushback-from-broadband-india-forum/article70348422.ece

The seasonally adjusted HSBC India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell from 59.2 in October to 56.6 in November, highlighting the slowest improvement in operating conditions since February. In the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) parlance, a print above 50 means expansion, while a score below 50 denotes contraction. ""India's final November PMI confirmed that U.S. tariffs caused the manufacturing expansion to slow,"" said Pranjul Bhandari, Chief India Economist at HSBC. ""Although companies suggested that the trend for international sales remained favourable – reflecting greater sales to clients in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East – there was a mild loss of overall growth momentum,"" the report said. On average, new export orders rose at the weakest pace in over a year. ""The new export orders PMI fell to a 13-month low. Business confidence, as indicated by expectations for future output, showed a big fall in November, potentially reflecting increasing concerns about the impact of tariffs,"" Mr. Bhandari said.

1644,2025,The Hindu,1644,"Portfolio rebalancing benefitsPremium We have discussed earlier, the essence of managing your portfolio is allocation to various investment assets e.g. equity, debt, gold, etc., as per your investment objectives, risk appetite and investment horizon. We have also discussed earlier, your investment portfolio, once constructed, should be reviewed from time to time. There is no defined frequency for review; it may be say quarterly, or on major market events. Today we will discuss portfolio rebalancing, which is modifying your portfolio upon a review. A portfolio review, as the term suggests, is a review. It need not necessarily lead to changes in your portfolio. People have a mindset that in a review, keep the funds/investments that are doing well and weed out the ones that are not doing well. However, that is only a minor purpose of a portfolio review. Investments or funds that are not doing well need not be eliminated immediately; these should be given adequate time to perform. Rather, if there is any significant change in your fundamentals e.g. increase in earnings, change in family e.g. marriage, birth, death, etc. - are events that should be the major considerations of a portfolio review. Rebalancing is tweaking your portfolio composition — sell some, buy some. The point is, a review is a check whether your portfolio needs any tweaks, but a review need not necessarily lead to changes. When you make changes to your portfolio, that is rebalancing. Portfolio rebalancing has certain powerful benefits that are not so well appreciated. Let us say you intended to construct a portfolio of 60% equity, 30% debt and 10% gold. Over a period of time, the equity market performed well, and your allocation ratio changed to 70% in equity and relatively lesser in the other assets. Debt also gave returns in this period but less than equity, hence the ratio of debt became lesser. Since 60-70% is a significant deviation, you do a rebalancing of your portfolio. You sell some equity components, bring it to 60% and increase ",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/portfolio-rebalancing-benefits/article70341419.ece

Inaugurating the event on the Government Pre-University College premises, Labour Minister Santosh S. Lad said that the Siddaramaiah-led Government’s foremost commitment was to work for the development of the State’s most marginalised communities. Recalling his long-standing connection with the region, he said his political journey began in Vittalapur and that the people of Sandur had first elected him to the Legislative Assembly. “In 2004, severe power shortages meant even a 40-watt bulb struggled to glow in many villages. Establishing a power substation here in Vittalapur was the first major step in illuminating the region,” he said. He added that, through phased development, Sandur had since been transformed into a model taluk. He recalled that his government had implemented the crucial drinking water project from the Tungabhadra reservoir to supply water to 80,000 households across 80 villages. “Today, through the five guarantee schemes, the government is sincerely spending ₹60,000 crore every year for the uplift of the poor and deprived,” he said.

This is the fourth consecutive session in which the rupee has depreciated against the dollar. A delayed U.S.-India trade deal, non-intervention from the RBI and a widening trade deficit are the reasons behind the depreciation, according to Dilip Parmar, Senior Research Analyst at HDFC Securities. The rupee has been on a declining trend since May 2025, and it hit a fresh low at the end of August at a little more than ₹88 per dollar. After this, analysts forecast that if the central bank did not step in at ₹89 a dollar, it would go as high as ₹90 a dollar. In November 2025, the rupee was down 0.8% while the dollar was also depreciating, marking a “puzzling” trend, Aditi Gupta, Economist at BoB research, wrote. “Annualised daily volatility was just 1.4% in the first half but increased to 4.9% in the second half,” Ms. Gupta said. While the widening trade deficit is cited as a factor, she said that the depreciation this time was more a result of the sentiments of traders in the backdrop of uncertainty surrounding the U.S.-India trade deal. “Receding FPI interest in Indian equities has also added to the depreciating currency,” she added.

The soft U.S. labour data along with the expectations of further interest rate cuts in the U.S., propped up the sentiment towards precious metals in the past few weeks. Comex gold zoomed and managed to settle above the psychological $4,200 mark at $4,256.4 by the end of November. This represents a gain of 6.05%. Comex silver saw a better show and managed to hit a fresh 52-week high. The white metal gained 18.31% in November and settled at a fresh lifetime high of $57.08.

The recent pull and consolidation phase appears complete and the next leg of the uptrend seems underway. Silver price could head to the next target of $60-$62 in the near term. Only a fall below the support zone of $48-$49 would be a cause of concern for the positive outlook for silver. Domestically, the MCX gold price almost mimicked the price action in the global markets. The price recovered in the past few days after having cooled off a bit in the middle of last month.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned that Ukraine now faces a “very difficult choice”, risking the loss of its dignity or a key partner. U.S. PresidentDonald Trumphas urged him to accept the proposal by Thanksgiving (November 27). Ukraine’s apprehensions are understandable. According to the leaked draft of Mr. Trump’s 28-point plan, Kyiv would be required to cede territory in Donetsk and recognise Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk as de facto Russian. In the other two oblasts annexed by Russia (Kherson and Zaporizhzhia), the conflict would be frozen along the line of contact, effectively allowing Moscow to retain the areas it has seized. Russia would withdraw from the territories it has captured outside the five oblasts and pledge not to attack neighbouring countries again. The plan also demands Ukraine cap its armed forces at 6,00,000 personnel and formally renounce its bid to join NATO. The bloc’s eastward expansion would be halted, sanctions on Russia lifted, while Ukraine would receive “reliable security guarantees”. The plan does not elaborate on these guarantees, but U.S. media said that the Trump administration has circulated a separate three-point plan, promising NATO-style security assurances to Kyiv. Russian President Vladimir Putin has positively responded to the proposal, but Ukraine and its European partners are scrambling to craft an alternative proposal to achieve what they call “peace with dignity”. Several elements of the Trump plan mirror Russia’s long-standing demands, including the halt of NATO’s eastward expansion. On the other hand, the proposal that Ukraine cede territory is not going to be easy for any Ukrainian leader to implement. This makes it enormously difficult for any mediator to craft a peace blueprint that provides genuine common ground for the warring parties.

1671,2025,The Hindu,1671,"​The Council of BJP: On the Bihar Council of Ministers The composition of the newly sworn-in Council of Ministers in Bihar, and thedistribution of portfolios, reflect the ongoing realignment of power between the BJP and the JD(U). JD(U) supremoNitish Kumar retains the post of Chief Minister, even though his party finished second to the BJP in theAssembly election. However, for the first time in his nearly 20 years as Chief Minister, he is not in charge of the Home Department. Samrat Choudhary, one of the two BJP Deputy Chief Ministers, now controls this administratively powerful ministry. Vijay Kumar Sinha, the other Deputy Chief Minister, has been assigned revenue, land reforms, mines and geology, further consolidating the BJP’s control over critical administrative levers. The BJP holds 14 of the 26 ministerial berths and controls key departments including health, law, road construction, urban development, and agriculture. The BJP has effectively taken a decisive step in formally inverting the hierarchy of its alliance with the JD(U) in its favour. While the BJP was the larger party even in 2020, Nitish Kumar retained crucial ministries. The social justice plank and the composition of the previous Assembly gave the JD(U) room to keep an alliance with the RJD open. But the overwhelming sweep of the National Democratic Alliance this time has not only placed the BJP firmly on top but has also made any exploration of alternatives by the JD(U) difficult, if not impossible. Nitish Kumar is battling ill-health; while he remains indispensable for the BJP, the party is also carefully planning its long-term path. It has built a wide and deep caste coalition, seeking to reach communities that have traditionally viewed the JD(U) as their platform. The induction of Ram Kripal Yadav, a former Lalu Yadav loyalist who joined the BJP, signals that Yadavs too can have a place in the party. Through clever social engineering and administrative manoeuvring, the BJP has now positioned itself at the pole position of Bihar politics.

Shivakumar arelocked in a power tussle, as the deputy wants to replace the leader, who is in no mood to oblige. When they bothassumed their current positions in 2023, it was reportedly based on a mutual agreement which also provided for a mid-term change of guard. Only the central functionaries of the Congress and these two leaders know the exact details of the power-sharing arrangement that was agreed upon in 2023. If indeed there was an agreement that Mr. Shivakumar would be handed over the baton, it is only honourable for that to be enforced by all involved, particularly the party supremo Rahul Gandhi. Mr. Shivakumar has remained loyal to the party through difficult times, facing cases and imprisonment, and accused of corruption by central agencies. While Mr. Shivakumar is valuable for the Congress for his organisational and managerial skills, which inspire confidence among party workers even beyond Karnataka, Mr. Siddaramaiah is valuable for a different reason. His standing as a champion of social justice enabled the Congress to widen and consolidate its acceptance among the subaltern communities in the State. The Chief Minister has dug his heels in, knowing that replacing him with Mr. Shivakumar, who hails from the dominant Vokkaliga community, is not an easy choice for the party. A Vokkaliga at the top can create a rupture in the Congress’s social base in Karnataka, and that works against Mr. Shivakumar. That is the deadlock. It is high time Congress leaders at the State and national levels looked beyond their narrow individual interests and calculations. In fact, the party could use the tussle in Karnataka to shuffle its deck nationally. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge is also from the State.

1673,2025,The Hindu,1673,"Cautious optimism: On India and growth India’s September-quarter GDP data for the current financial year beat all estimates, coming in at 8.2%, higher than 7.8% in Q1 FY26 and well above the year-ago period. This offers fleeting reassurance to policymakers, days after October’s trade data revealed a historic deficit of $41.68 billion, driven partly by a trebling of bullion imports — a signal of economic uncertainty. Growth has been led by manufacturing (9.1%) and services (9.2%), supported by a recovery in private consumption. Private Final Consumption Expenditure grew 7.9% in Q2 FY26, compared with 6.4% in Q2 FY25, while government spending also provided a modest boost. Together, these suggest a broad-based uptick in domestic activity despite global headwinds. Yet, the full effects of the external shock may surface in the quarters ahead. The U.S.’s ‘two-stage’ India tariffs, in August, landed mid-quarter. Some front-loading of export orders ahead of these tariffs may also have inflated Q2 output. A second statistical effect is at play. Retail inflation fell to 0.25% in October, the lowest in the current CPI series, contributing to a GDP deflator reportedly below 1%. A deflator this low mechanically inflates real GDP relative to nominal; the narrow gap between nominal GDP (8.7%) and real GDP (8.2%) underscores this. Should inflation rise or input costs firm up — if oil prices climb as India diversifies away from Russian crude — headline GDP growth may moderate. The RBI’s upcoming Monetary Policy Committee meeting adds uncertainty, as any policy rate will shape demand-side pressures. The Gross Value Added breakdown shows construction growing 7.2%, and the services sub-segment of financial, real estate and professional services rising 10.2% — indicating that capital-intensive, infrastructure-linked sectors have been central to this momentum. Monthly industrial indicators reinforce this pattern: the IIP rose 4% in September, with core capital-intensive categories such as steel (14.1%) and cement (5.3%) reco",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/cautious-optimism-on-india-and-growth/article70345469.ece
1674,2025,The Hindu,1674,"​Limited room: On the Indian rupee Between late November 2024 and now, the rupee has depreciated about 7%,sliding from roughly ₹83.4 a dollar to about ₹89.2. This is not unprecedented as in 2018, it slid 11%-12% against the dollar. The comparison is instructive because the political and trade backdrops have echoes of that earlier period. In 2018, during the first term of U.S. President Donald Trump, global dollar strength, rising U.S. interest rates and trade tensions pressured emerging market currencies, including the rupee. The RBI used its first longer-term currency-swap as a systemic liquidity check. In 2019, it completed a $5 billion three-year dollar/rupee swap. And in February 2025, it carried out a $10 billion dollar/rupee buy-sell swap auction to infuse long-term rupee liquidity into the banking system under global stress. Such swaps are a standard tool by central banks to supply liquidity, shore up forex reserves and prevent disorderly currency depreciation when the dollar surges or capital flows reverse. The steep rupee slide in November arises in a context of external pressures — a widening current-account deficit, driven partly by higher imports of bullion, as a hedge in uncertain times, and exporters scrambling to maintain competitiveness amid high U.S. trade tariffs. In such a hostile global macro-environment, the RBI’s mandate is limited: under the floating-but-managed regime, it can only ‘smoothen volatility’ rather than fix the exchange rate. Between November last year and now, the RBI sold a net of roughly $50 billion in forex to stabilise the rupee. Even so, the slide has proceeded, highlighting the external pressures. That said, there is room for cautious optimism. India’s foreign exchange reserves are comfortable — close to $693 billion. On the domestic front, retail inflation has slumped: headline CPI inflation came in at just 0.25% in October 2025, well below the RBI’s target-band of 2%-6%.

The question practically wrote itself: was the threat being managed here public safety or political embarrassment? Air quality in North India in winter is often discussed as a Delhi issue, yet monitoring stations have revealed a continuous zone of foul air from around Islamabad to Bihar. Emissions from industry, power generation, transport and agriculture circulate in this shared airshed. This is why the India Gate protests are politically significant. Delhi’s middle class has usually responded with air purifiers, closed windows, vacations and private dissatisfaction — but apparently not anymore. And the state has responded by policing rather than engagement. Deploying Rapid Action Force units shows that the government treats these gatherings as a law-and-order rather than a governance problem. North India’s winter smog is the most visible part of a wider national crisis. Long-term analyses of particulate pollution, such as the Air Quality Life Index, have shown that unsafe air is now the norm for most of India — and that present regulation, monitoring, and enforcement arrangements are insufficient across States and sectors. Treating the problem as a seasonal emergency, in the face of evidence pointing to a permanent condition demanding permanent institutions, has encouraged only bursts of action. The airshed is the primary unit of governance. Today, authority is split among central ministries, State departments, municipal bodies and specialised regulators, each with partial jurisdiction and mixed incentives.

The trigger was Japan’s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s November 7 statement that any Chinese military actions against Taiwan could pose a threat to Japan’s survival, implying that Tokyo might intervene militarily. This was the first time a sitting Japanese Prime Minister made an explicit remark about Japan’s stance on a potential Chinese military action in Taiwan, marking a sharp departure from the cautious strategic ambiguity that Tokyo had long maintained. An enragedChina has demandedthat Ms. Takaichi retract her remarks, and has banned Japanese seafood imports and issued travel advisories to its citizens to avoid Japan. China has also claimed that Japan is planning to deploy missiles on Yonaguni island near Taiwan, calling it “an extremely dangerous move”. Chinese Coast Guard vessels are also patrolling the waters around the disputed Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, actions Japan says violate its territorial waters. Beijing has warned that any Japanese military intervention in Taiwan would be treated as an act of aggression. China’s anger is not entirely unfounded. Japan’s colonial legacy still casts a long shadow over the region. From 1895 to 1945, Taiwan lived under Japanese occupation following the Treaty of Shimonoseki. Japan’s brutal occupation of parts of China left wounds that are still raw in Chinese collective memory. Taiwan was returned to Chinese control after Japan was defeated in the Second World War, but became a separate administrative entity when the Kuomintang retreated there following the communist revolution of 1949.

1677,2025,The Hindu,1677,"​Speedbreakers ahead: On India’s economic data The last few days have shown just what a roller coaster of a ride India’s economic data can take. Last Friday’s robust Q2 GDP growth, asix-quarter high of 8.2%, lifted the government’s mood and brought cheer to its supporters. The relatively low nominal growth rate and grade by the IMF did little to dampen this feeling. However, the latest data on the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) and, to an extent, the manufacturing PMI are likely to do more in that regard. TheIIP’s growth in October 2025 was just 0.4%, a 14-month low. While the GDP data for the July-September quarter showed the manufacturing sector growing 9.1%, the IIP showed the sector had slowed to a 14-month low of 1.8% in October. One of the possible reasons for this is that the GDP growth rate was boosted by a low base, since the sector had grown just 2.2% in the July-September 2024 quarter. The other, more troubling reason, is the impact of the U.S.’s tariffs. Merchandise exports grew in September, the first full month of 50% tariffs, as earlier orders were being fulfilled. They then contracted nearly 12% in October as the tariffs began to weigh on new order decisions. The PMI data, too, showed that the score for India’s manufacturing sector stood at a nine-month low of 56.6 in November. The report specifically mentioned that new export orders rose at their slowest pace in over a year, another sign that the U.S.’s tariffs were hurting. While subdued exports likely weighed on the manufacturing sector, the change in weather towards winter and prolonged rains pulled down the electricity and mining sectors, respectively. As a result, the primary goods sector contracted in October. The GDP data had shown that investment had grown by a reasonably strong 7.3% in Q2. However, the IIP data suggest this could have slowed in the beginning of Q3 with the capital goods sector growing at a 14-month low of 2.4%.

The controversy is also about the form of the Environment Ministry’s instruments that normalised those exceptions. TheEnvironment (Protection) Act 1986and EIA notifications of1994and2006are framed around prior environmental clearance (EC), which means that large construction and industrial projects must not start work until an authority has assessed their consequences. Decisions by the Court includingCommon Cause(2017) andAlembic Pharmaceuticals(2020)treated post-facto EC as impermissible where prior EC was mandatory. The order in May,inVanashakti, read this as ruling out post-facto ECs altogether for such projects. The new majority does not say ‘EC first’ is no longer the rule but locates a narrow space for post-facto clearances by relying onAlembic,D. Swamy, and others to allow ‘regularisation’ when considerable resources have already been committed, usually with fines. This still means that the Ministry can maintain ‘EC first’ as the legal default and allow post-facto clearances only in rare, highly constrained cases. In any case the spirit of the EC regime remains ex ante. A clearance granted after construction has begun or finished cannot replicate the EIA’s rationale, which is to make environment-related decisions before the potential cumulative consequences are underway. Post-facto clearances can only impose penalties, prescribe mitigation or order closure or demolition. Even if the judiciary permits such ECs in some circumstances now, the clearances will be remedial and sit uneasily with the structure of environmental jurisprudence in India since the 1990s. The majority’s concern about differential treatment of past and future violators is also understandable, even if its remedy is not.

This remarkable political longevity reflects not just his personal acumen but also theJD(U)’s electoral performance, which saw theparty double its previous tally to 85 seats. His success owes much to the social coalition he has painstakingly built over the years. The JD(U)’s support base amongthe EBCsand Dalits, augmented by substantial backing from women across these sections, has provided accretion to the support bases of the BJP and other NDA allies. Thismulti-caste, multi-class coalitiongave the alliance a decisive social edge over the Opposition Mahagatbandhan, helping it stave off anti-incumbency. That voters have prioritised welfare deliveries over Mr. Kumar’s serial realignments speaks to the efficacy of targeted benefits in insulating incumbents. Yet, electoral success cannot obscure the hard reality that confronts the septuagenarian leader. Bihar remains at the absolute bottom on virtually every socioeconomic indicator. It continues to be the largest source of out-migration, a consequence of inadequate employment opportunities. Its economy remains trapped in a vicious cycle: agriculture hampered by fragmented landholdings and concentrated ownership, and a services sector largely confined to government employment. The near absence of organised industry and the State’s inability to attract investments represent a governance failure that transcends political partisanship. Years of administration have prioritised road and bridge construction, while education and health have languished. The Opposition’s inability to capitalise on these deficiencies is telling.

While theSupreme Court continues to hearchallenges to the constitutionality of the SIR process pioneered in Bihar, the same flawed approach is being persisted with in other States. Voters are tofill enumeration formsdelivered by Booth Level Officers (BLO) and match their details against electoral rolls from 2002-2005. Thoughdata from Bihar suggest that the process did not dramatically alter election outcomes, it saw a sharp decline in the gender ratio of the electorate. Other localised distortions also warrant concern. The ECI claims that enumeration forms have been delivered to most electors in the 12 States and UTs, but genuine voters continue to scramble for forms, and confusion persists about thedocumentation requiredfor enrolment on the draft rolls due next month. The guideline mandating that BLOs visit households appears to be only on paper. The Gauhati High Court, in Dr. Manmohan Singh (1999), interpreted requirements in the Representation of the People Act, 1950 expansively: an ordinary resident is a habitual resident with the intention to dwell permanently — whom any reasonable person would accept as a resident of that place. Operating from this principle, the ECI and the judiciary have historically presumed that any resident adult was, by default, a valid voter. The SIR inverts this presumption. Regardless of having voted earlier, every elector mustnow prove their legitimacyagainst old records or documents listed by the ECI. This shifting of the burden, from the state to citizens, risks major disenfranchisement, especially married women and migrants, as in Bihar.

In a welcome move, the Centre has released a further version of the policy, though the details are not yet available in the public realm, to give the nation a booster shot at trying to fix the rather humongous AMR problem that the country has had to contend with, increasing volumes to boot. In October, WHO released its Global antibiotic resistance surveillance report, which recorded that in 2023, approximately one in three bacterial infections in India were resistant to commonly-used antibiotics. Globally, it was one in six confirmed infections. It spelt out why India was disproportionately affected — factors included a high infectious disease burden, overuse and misuse of antibiotics and gaps in the surveillance and healthcare infrastructure. E.coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae have exhibited high resistance to critical antibiotics, making the very last line of drugs ineffective. But human health is not the sole footprint AMR possesses; there is scarcely a field in the food chain where its cold arms have not touched — from veterinary practices to contaminating soil and water health and, thereby, agriculture and aquaculture. This ubiquitous spread of AMR has spurred scientists to push the One Health technique — it integrates the prisms of human health, animal health and environmental health — to handle growing resistance in communities. The time is, no doubt, ripe for India to take AMR seriously and push for an enhanced, committed antibiotics stewardship programme. While the first National Action Plan played a key role in raising the profile of AMR, the actual implementation suffered.

The President’s assent was effectively his concession to enormous pressure from both sides of the political divide, Democrats and Republicans, who had mounted a strong campaign to shine a light upon Epstein’s communications including those with or mentioning Mr. Trump. With the House of Representatives passing the Epstein-related legislation by a 427-1 vote, and the Senate granting unanimous consent to pass the same, there was no avoiding presidential approval for the demand to reveal detailed documentation regarding a man who was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor and died by suicide before facing charges relating to sex trafficking of minors. The DoJ has to release within 30 days all files stemming from the investigation of Epstein, with redactions allowed only for details of his victims but not for details of others that may cause any “embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity”. The broader context to the turn in theEpstein sagais the established fact of Mr. Trump’s friendship with Epstein, even though the President has refuted all knowledge of Epstein’s criminal activities and that he severed relations years ago. Indeed, even though there was no mention of suggested criminality, Mr. Trump’s name was writ large in the 20,000 pages of documents from Epstein’s estate thatcongressional lawmakers releasedrecently.

The move is another unmistakable sign that India wants to be seen as a sports destination of repute. The choice of Ahmedabad as the host city is strategic too, for India has submitted theLetter of Intent to hold the 2036 Olympicswith Ahmedabad as the front-runner. However, while theOlympicsretains its allure and grandeur, the CWG has been beset with difficulties. Once signifying the imperial unity of the British empire, the CWG is struggling for relevance in the post-colonial world. Successive host cities have dropped out citing rising costs –Birmingham replaced Durban in 2022; Glasgow has come to the rescue for 2026 after theAustralian State of Victoria withdrew, and Ahmedabad has stepped in for the Canadian province of Alberta. Not so long ago, India itself was cold to the competition, with the then Indian Olympic Association president Narinder Batra, in 2019, calling it “sub-standard” — albeit in his personal capacity — and strongly pitching for India’s withdrawal. Also, when New Delhi conducted the Games in 2010, there were allegations galore of large-scale corruption and incompetence. So, what merit does India see now? First, it is an important soft-power medium. Second, the nation’s sporting aspirations have grown manifold, and though performances by its sportspersons have not kept pace, there is a genuine push toward diversifying on-field excellence and going beyond just cricket.

But for Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty’sdoubles bronze at the World Championships in Parisin August, there has been precious little. Against this backdrop,Lakshya Sen’s triumph at the Australian Openon Sunday has come like a breath of fresh air. It was not the toughest of fields and the tournament — a BWF Super 500, third in the sport’s hierarchy after Super 1000 and 750 — is not pedigreed. But it was no low-hanging fruit either, for Lakshya had to spend long hours on court, including in the come-from-behind semi-final victory over World No. 6 Chou Tien Chen. The title was the 24-year-old’s first since the Syed Modi International Super 300 last December, and the first outside India since the Canada Open Super 500 in July 2023. Ever since the disappointment of losing the 2024 Paris Olympics bronze medal match from a dominant position, Lakshya has endured difficult times. Injuries and a spate of early exits — 11 in the first round this year alone — had sent him tumbling down. But a trophy in his last act of 2025 should give him the required fillip. Whether this acts as a springboard for other Indians in 2026 remains to be seen. Apart from Satwiksairaj and Chirag, no other Indian is ranked in the top 10 of any badminton discipline.

1685,2025,The Hindu,1685,"Zero stars: On the Sanchar Saathi app The growing sophistication of cybercrimes, from “digital arrests” to anonymous, large-scale cross-border scams, has made tackling them both urgent and difficult. Cybercriminals have exploited a security gap wherein user accounts on instant messaging apps remain functional even after the associated SIM card has been removed, using this anonymity to conduct government impersonation fraud. The rampant use of spoofed or tampered IMEI numbers has also made tracking perpetrators nearly impossible for law enforcement. It is perhaps inevitable that the government seeks sharper tools to address these software and hardware vulnerabilities, which explains the Department of Telecommunications’ directives on November 28 and December 1. The first mandates“SIM binding”— ensuring that a user’s account is disabled if the physical SIM is removed. In the second,smartphone manufacturers must pre-install the Sanchar Saathi appto verify device authenticity in all new devices by March 2026. While the first directive is a security patch which could inconvenience WhatsApp/Internet messaging users, the second is reminiscent of the saying, the road to hell is often paved with good intentions. The solution to the problem of counterfeit handsets and spoofed IMEI numbers is a cure that could potentially be more damaging than the disease. The explicit instruction in the directive that the app is “readily visible and accessible to the end users at the time of first use or device setup and that its functionalities are not disabled or restricted” would mean thatthis app will be given a higher security clearancewithin the phone’s operating system, allowing it more intrusive access to features such as camera, phone or SMS access. The potential for misuse of this app for state surveillance and being utilised by a malicious entity after compromise to target millions of users is very present and clear.

Passed by Parliament between 2019 and 2020, the implementation of these Codes was delayed for multiple reasons. TheCodes replace 29 lawsthat regulated employer-employee relations, and significantly reduce the compliance requirements for a company every year. The Centre has maintained that it will hand-hold the States to draft and adopt the Rules in accordance with the Codes — most States and Union Territories have published the draft Rules for the Codes. Free market advocates have always considered India’s labour laws to be a hindrance to its growth potential. Under the Codes, worker-employer relations, social security mechanism and wage and aspects of emoluments will witness huge changes. India needs to generate employment for its growing youth population as it is estimated that 12 million people attain working age every year. This is a trend that will hold for several years. TheEconomic Survey of 2023-24noted that there needs to be an average of nearly 78.5 lakh jobs created annually until 2030 in the non-farm sector to engage the rising workforce. Despite the long delay in the implementation of the Codes, the concerns raised by labour unions have not been addressed in full. Labour representatives allege that the government ignored the pro-worker recommendations of the Second National Commission on Labour, (submitted in 2002) and, instead, accommodated all “pro employer” recommendations and made them a part of the Codes. Those issues are now redundant, but the nature of work is undergoing rapid transformation.

1687,2025,The Hindu,1687,"Sorry, but the captain’s apology is now part of the gamePremium Captains apologising for team failures is approaching the status of a cliché in the modern game. It is undoubtedly a noble gesture, this acceptance of responsibility. It is both theatre and therapy. It is good PR, and a way of restoring the bond between team and fan, a reassurance that disappointment is shared, and nobody hurts alone. Following England’s surrender in theopening Test of the Ashes series, skipper Ben Stokes said, “I could have been a lot better as captain. I wasn’t as clear as I normally am.” In India, Rishabh Pant saidafter losing to South Africa, “Sorry we couldn’t live up to expectations this time… we will work hard, regroup, refocus and reset to come back stronger and better as a team and individuals.” The captain’s apology, like the switch hit or data analysis, is an aspect of contemporary cricket. England skipper Douglas Jardine was unrepentant after the Bodyline series in 1932-33, while his fast bowler Harold Larwood was asked to apologise by his cricket board. He didn’t, saying he was following his captain’s orders (as an aside, this is an example of cricket’s class system where batters are the aristocrats and bowlers the plebeians). It is not unusual for defeated captains and players to feel they have let down their supporters and resolve to do better the next time. This is human nature. Some articulate their thoughts, others save them for their memoir, where time and ghostwriters allow them to settle on a happy choice of words. Nothing is permanent in sport. Not form or fortune, or indeed public affection. A captain who apologises too often becomes a caricature. One who refuses to apologise at all becomes a villain, while one who apologises just enough is mythologised for taking responsibility. Captains have to get the ‘just enough’ right. The more frequently captains apologise, however, the less we expect them to actually mean it. We subject the apology to the kind of analysis otherwise reserved for the captain’s footwork at the crease or h",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/sorry-but-the-captains-apology-is-now-part-of-the-game/article70349318.ece

But, substantively, it is a blow to federalism as it effectively allows Governors unchecked powers to block or delay State legislation without constitutional accountability. This opinion contradicts a progressive judgment in April 2025 that hadprescribed three-month timelinesand usedArticle 142togrant deemed assent to some Billspassed in the Tamil Nadu Assembly. The Court invoked separation of powers to reject timelines and Article 142’s use, but this empowers Governors at the cost of State rights. The judgment claims that Articles 200 and 201 prescribe no deadlines, but disregards explicit constitutional text. In Article 200, the Governor must declare his decision “as soon as possible” — the Court called it too “elastic” to support timelines, rendering constitutional text unenforceable. The Court’s assertion that Governors are not bound by the Council of Ministers’ aid and advice contradicts constitutional history. The framers explicitly removed the phrase “in his discretion” — a phrase in the Government of India Act, 1935 — from Articles 200 and 201. Even the Punchhi Commission recommended a six-month period for Governors to decide on Bills. The Court did rule that withholding assent must be followed by returning the Bill to the Assembly. But the judgment rules that even if the Assembly passes the Bill a second time, the Governor retains the option to reserve it for the President. This kills the binding nature of the legislature’s second passage. Consequently, whether at first instance or after reconsideration, a Governor can refer a Bill to the President under Article 200.

The symbolism was high this year. It is 10 years since theParis Agreementwas signed by 195 countries — a pact to ensure that the globe did not heat up beyond 2°C of pre-industrial times and, as far as possible, contain it to 1.5°C. That was a goal easier stated than done; 2024 ended up being the first time that temperatures breached the 1.5°C territory though it will require several more such transgressions for 1.5°C to be the ‘new normal’. In all the years since, COPs have been about systematically getting all countries to move on the path of restructuring their economies away from their fossil-fuel hardwiring; apportioning responsibility — and finance — in ways to actualise these goals, and finally work towards addressing the damage that climate change had already done to societies, livelihoods and ecologies. While there has been success, in that most countries — even the United States — recognise that renewables are the future of energy, it has been challenging for countries to execute the transformation while also growing their economies and keeping their competitive edges sharp. This has led to the formation of the two broad blocs — one led by developed countries and affiliated allies that has pushed for hard targets and road maps to phase out fossil fuels, and the other by developing countries or petro states who reject such prescription and demand more money and action from the developed countries. The Brazil COP sought to bring a change in the narrative bystressing ‘implementation’, and reminding the world that multilateralism and ‘mutirão’ (coming together) were indispensable to the Paris Agreement.

The summit has an added voice as the African Union was made a member during India’s G20 Presidency in 2023. As a result, the deliberations and thedeclarationseemed imbued by the spirit of the “Global South”, as they listed the multiple challenges the world faces including conflicts, deepening inequality and increasing economic uncertainty. In particular, the nations gathered called for a “just, comprehensive, and lasting peace” in “Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Occupied Palestinian Territory [and] Ukraine”, invoking the UN charter. Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke at all three sessions of the G-20, suggesting six initiatives that India could lead in order to address some of those issues, particularly on the need to “reconsider” the parameters of global development. Theseinitiativesincluded a Traditional Knowledge Repository, a G20-Africa Skills Multiplier Initiative (where India proposed to train a million people across Africa), a Global Healthcare Response Team, an Initiative on Countering the Drug–Terror Nexus, an “Open Satellite Data Partnership” to share agriculture, fishing and disaster-related information, and a “G20 Critical Minerals Circularity initiative”.

Seemingly invincible at home and with an aura that made former Australian captain Steve Waugh refer to India as the final frontier, rival units struggled to stay afloat. But empires do crumble and that reality overwhelmed Rishabh Pant’s men asSouth Africa won the second Test by 408 runs and seized the series 2-0. Last year, the visitingNew Zealanders swept the Test series 3-0, and now it is Temba Bavuma’s turn to trigger a coup. The South African captain led astutely, both at Kolkata and in Guwahati, and his men’s excellent performance reiterated their defending champion status in the ICC World Test Championship.Coach Gautam Gambhiris facing intense scrutiny though under his watch India drew the away Test series in England and won the ICC Champions Trophy and Asia Cup. But the sudden vulnerability in Tests at home sticks out like a sore thumb. It is a fact that over the last few years, personnel have changed and India no longer features Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, R. Ashwin and Cheteshwar Pujara in Test whites. Meanwhile, Ajinkya Rahane has been dropped and Mohammed Shami is yet to find his way back. Change is inevitable; but India’s downfall in home Tests has been steep. Theabsence of injured captain Shubman Gillin the secondTestwas a hard blow, and the rest of the batters failed to raise their game.

1692,2025,The Hindu,1692,"​Data deficiencies: On India and the IMF’s low grading TheIMF’s ‘C’ grade for India’s national accounts statisticsshould be a matter of concern for India, which has a reasonably robust data collection and analysis apparatus in place. A ‘C’ grade is the second lowest there is, and implies that there are some issues with the data that impede the adequate surveillance of the economy. National accounts not only include zoomed out macro indicators such as GDP and GVA but also sectoral metrics and measures of investment levels, consumer spending and — of particular interest right now — how exports are doing. Issues with these metrics, therefore, impede effective and targeted policymaking. A grade of ‘C’ puts India in the same league as China when it comes to its national accounts, a decidedly unenviable position to be in. The IMF is not the first to point out the flaws in India’s national accounts. Nor is this the first time that it has pointed them out. The IMF’s main problem with the national accounts data, that its base year of 2011-12 is very outdated, has been pointed out time and again. Outdated data is a problem India has been grappling with for a while now. The Index of Industrial Production and the Consumer Price Index both have a base year of 2011-12. In fact, even the IMF said the reason that India’s CPI received a grade of ‘B’ and not ‘A’ was because of the outdated base year. The outdated base year and the inordinate weightage of food in the CPI have resulted in India not being able to accurately capture price movements. Consequently, the RBI’s monetary policy is also impaired. The government is currently in the process of updating the base years and methodologies for national accounts, CPI, and IIP, with the new series due to be launched in early 2026. Perhaps the biggest issue with the national accounts statistics in India — and the area that requires the most attention — is the inability to accurately capture the informal sector.

TGPCB granted approvals for the establishment of 2,620 new companies and issued Consent for Operations (CFO) to 3,521 units between January 2024 and October 2025, after verifying adherence to environmental norms for air and water pollution control. About 7,966 wastewater/hazardous waste samples and 3,807 air pollutant samples were collected from various industries during the same period to ensure strict pollution management. Laboratory results will determine further action against non-compliant units. A 24/7 online monitoring cell has been set up to continuously track emissions and pollutants from 501 highly polluting industries. The Task Force Committee reviewed 108 industries for exceeding pollution norms and directed immediate corrective measures, warning of legal action for continued non-compliance.

The engravings, oriented towards the South, bear close resemblance to engravings earlier recorded at Ettukudukka and Ariyittapara. The latest finding builds on discoveries made a month ago by historical researcher Nandakumar Koroth, Satheesan Kaliyanam, and University of Baroda students Asna Jiji and Anagha Sivaramakrishnan, who had reported carvings resembling a falcon and a snake. However, officials now say that the earlier interpretations were incorrect and that the engravings are actually those of a cow and probably a deer. The inspection was carried out by a team led by K. Krishnaraj, Officer of the Pazhassi Raja Museum, Kozhikode, along with Archaeology department Excavation Assistant V.A. Vimalkumar, museum staffer T.P. Nibin and local archaeologist Satheesan Kaliyanam. Mr. Krishnaraj says the discoveries add weight to evidence that Valiyapara was a significant site in the centuries-old tradition of rock art carved with sharp tool across red laterite formations stretching from Ratnagiri in Maharashtra to Wayanad in Kerala. The engraving indicates a shared artistic and cultural practice that spanned the western coast and its hinterland. The team documented various sections of the site and said photographs from different portions of the rock would undergo detailed analysis. In addition, the department inspected footprint-shaped carvings near Kanhirapoil and several small cave-like structures etched into laterite formation in different parts of Madikkai panchayat. These features, officials say, could provide further insight into the prehistoric activity that once flourished in the region.

Shailesh Chandra, MD & CEO, TMPV., said, “With the new Sierra, we are setting a new benchmark for what Indian mobility can be. The Tata Sierra stands as a testament to our belief that customers deserve more than the ordinary: they deserve innovation that inspires, design that resonates emotionally, and a premium experience that elevates every journey.” “This legend returns to inspire pride, express individuality and embrace progress, while enjoying the highest standards of comfort, technology, and safety. The Sierra is our commitment to lead, to challenge conventions, and to deliver an icon that truly moves India forward with purpose and distinction,” he said. In an interview, Mr. Chandra said, “It is a very important milestone for us and it is just not launch of another car, it is a very emotional moment for Tata Motors because we are bringing a car which was discontinued 25 years back and which had a cult following.” “This was the car which brought the concept of lifestyle SUV for the first time. It was very ahead of its time, and therefore, when we have launched this car, it has to be done with the responsibility of ensuring that it has the DNA of the original Sierra,” he said. “At the same time, it has to be relevant to the new generation of customers. So, we have to build this fusion into the new avatar that we are creating, and that is how it has been conceived,” he added. Stating that the mid-size SUV segment has been growing very fast with a monthly sales volume of 45,000 units by all players, he said innovation in this segment had been lacking. “So we are positioning it in the premium mid-SUV, which does not exist today.

1711,2025,The Hindu,1711,"SC directs Kerala to establish primary schools in areas lacking them The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed the Kerala government to take a “holistic decision” to establish government lower and upper primary schools in all areas where none are functioning. Observing that every child should have access to neighbourhood schooling as mandated under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, a Bench comprising Chief Justice of India Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi issued a series of directions. The Bench upheld a Kerala High Court directive asking the State government to set up a school in an area that had no educational facility within a three-to-four kilometre radius. “The State of Kerala must take a holistic decision to establish government primary schools in all areas where none are functioning under the 2009 Act,” it said, adding, “In all such areas with difficult geographical terrain, schools must be established without delay.” The bench laid down a two-phase approach. In the first phase, the government will have to identify all regions without any lower or upper primary school. In the second phase, schools must be established in all areas lacking a lower primary school within a radius of one kilometre or an upper primary school within 3-4 kilometres. “We are conscious that the state government may not have funds for wholesome construction of required schools. In this regard, let some private buildings be identified where schools can be established as a makeshift arrangement. But such arrangements cannot continue indefinitely, and the necessary budgetary allocation needs to be made for the same,” CJI Kant said. The Bench was hearing the appeal of the State government against the Kerala High Court order on a petition that sought setting up of a school at Elambra in Manjeri municipality, where there were no primary educational institutions within a 3-4 kilometre radius. The high court had directed the Manjeri municipality to take urgent steps for construction of necessary buildings for the school.

Addressing a recent CME held to educate doctors from medical colleges, especially the postgraduate doctors in the region, Dr. Narayan said while the time to thrombolysis had been consistently reduced to less than one hour in the last three years, this duration ideally needed to be brought down to half an hour. The neurology chief also retraced the gradual upgradation of stroke care services in Jipmer which now included thrombolytic therapy, surgical decompression for large strokes from 2009, mechanical thrombectomy from 2024 and various neurorehabilitation therapies, including robotics. A stroke post-doctoral fellowship training programme has also been introduced at Jipmer, he said. During the event, P. Vijaya, president of the Indian Stroke Association formally released the Jipmer stroke guidelines edited by Dr. Narayan and the Jipmer stroke team. In her address, Dr. Vijaya, who had established a stroke treatment facility in Guntur in Andhra Pradesh as early as in 1990s and had spearheaded a globally acclaimed public campaign against stroke, stressed the gravity of the growing epidemic of stroke in India and other low-income countries where its devastating effects were the worst. The programme was chaired by Vir Singh Negi, Jipmer Director. S.Vinodkumar, Medical Superintendent and Pankaj Kundra, acting Dean, felicitated.

Like many, I initially thought it might be a prop, until the host said otherwise. “That’s right, it’s me underneath this salt-and-pepper cookie-pusher,” Colbert quipped. “For tonight, my upper lip is home to what many in the beauty industry are calling ‘technically a moustache’”. Later in the same episode, Colbert criticised CBS’s parent company Paramount for settling a lawsuit with President Donald Trump for $16 million, calling it “a big fat bribe”. Trump had alleged that CBS “deceptively edited” an interview with Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, a claim that Paramount said was “entirely without merit” in their reply. Yet they coughed up $16 million anyway. Colbert finished the segment about Paramount by joking that even if the network decides to discontinueThe Late Showto placate Trump, he could “always sneak into the building with this moustache”. Three nights later, Colbert announced on the show that the cancellation fears were real; Paramount had decided to discontinue the show in May 2026 for “financial reasons”. He’s not being replaced by a different host — the entireLate Showfranchise (David Letterman was at the helm from 1993-2015) will simply cease to exist. Colbert’s former colleague and fellow satirist Jon Stewart pointed out another crucial piece of the puzzle. “The fact that CBS wouldn’t save its own number-one-rated network late-night franchise,” Stewart said, “that’s been on the air for over three decades, is part of what’s making everybody wonder was this purely financial? Or maybe the path of least resistance for your 8-billion-dollar merger?” Stewart was referring to Paramount’s impending $8 billion merger with the firm Skydance — a deal that Trump had previously indicated he would block as payback for his perceived grievance about the Harris interview.

1721,2025,The Hindu,1721,"Dhoni is the natural choice as captain of best all-format XIPremium The selection of Shubman Gill for the Asia Cupmight be debatable. Not because he is not good enough, but because the Test series against the West Indies commences three days after the final there. He will soon be an all-format captain. T20 has evolved quickly thanks to the domestic franchises, and what, in another field, would be called continuous research. T20 progresses in a different culture altogether. Not surprisingly, the all-format player is becoming a rarity; impactful T20 players are not necessarily automatic selections for Tests, and vice versa. Hence the obvious question: what is India’s best all-format team? India played (and won) their first-ever T20I in 2006, against South Africa, who like them, fielded a Test team. India’s game-altering World Cup win was a few months away. The IPL was in the future. The data-crunchers hadn’t yet got into their act, and it was all seen as a bit of a hit-and-giggle affair. Any all-format team would have to be picked from players who actually took part in a T20I, which means the Kapil Devs, and Mohammad Azharuddins who might have been automatic selections won’t make it. Admittedly, this is a fantasy team, and there is an argument for including such players on the basis of what they have accomplished in other formats, but we need to draw a line somewhere. So no Kapil, Salim Durrani or Anil Kumble (although he did play for RCB in the IPL). The inevitable arguments can begin right here! Sachin Tendulkar played that inaugural match. He made only 10 runs, but considering he ended up with another 34,347 runs in all formats combined, with a hundred centuries and 201 wickets, it will be difficult to keep him out (not that one needs to).

1722,2025,The Hindu,1722,"Column by Devdutt Pattanaik | Kailasa in CambodiaPremium A few decades before the Chola king Rajaraja I built the Brihadeeswara Temple in Tamil Nadu, around 1000 AD, a Khmer king called Jayavarman IV had begun building a temple to replicate the Kailasa mountain in Cambodia, at Koh Ker, complete with a tank that would replicate the river Ganga. It followed Tantrik principles of architecture, and a nearby river bed was covered with hundreds of Shivalingasto transform the water into Ganga. This was 200 years before the building of the now famoustourist destination Angkor Wat. The Shiva of Koh Ker is not some gentle yogi. He is a great god of kings, a god of power, a god of dominance, a Tantrik god. Built in the 10th century CE, Koh Ker was for a brief moment the capital of the Khmer Empire before Angkor took over. Jayavarman IV was not interested in modesty; he wanted a capital that proclaimed power. So, he placed Shiva at the centre of everything. At Koh Ker, he built a massive seven-tiered pyramid called Prasat Thom. Prasat means ‘prasada’ or enclosure in Sanskrit, a common term for temples. It looks nothing like the curvingshikharaof Indian temples. It looks like a step-pyramid, raw and imposing, more Mayan than Indian. But on top of it stood thelingaof Shiva, rising like a cosmic pillar, visible from miles around. The message was clear: the king was Shiva’s chosen, the axis of the universe had been placed in his capital, and his earthly representative. This is classic Deva-raja (God-king) cult, where the god and the king merge into one cosmic being. You can see why Jayavarman IV wanted Koh Ker as his capital. It was propaganda in stone. Around this pyramid, the site was filled with dozens of Shiva temples. Archaeologists have counted more than 180 sanctuaries scattered across 80 square kilometres. Many shrines were built to houselingas, each named with cosmic attributes: Prasat Krahom, Prasat Pram, and so on. Statues of multi-headed serpents ornagasin the Koh Ker complex

You had to wake up at a certain time, get dressed for school without being reminded, be a straight A student, have only ‘good girls’ as friends, walk to school but pretend you have blinkers on, come straight home, and spend the rest of your time buried in your school books. If you didn’t do everything that was expected from you, you were met with ‘what will she do tomorrow when she goes to her in-laws place?’ It seemed to me that growing up was a military operation and all roads ultimately led to the biggest battlefield of all: marriage. Surprisingly, these rules didn’t irk me too much as I had grown accustomed to them. But what really got under my skin was that none of these regulations applied to my male counterparts. They were expected, at most, to be perfect at their studies. It is no surprise that I became somewhat of a perfectionist, and while the people around me have always appreciated the end results of this attribute, no one except me has had to deal with the crippling anxiety and self-doubt that came with it. For most of my life, I seemed to pull off one miracle after another. Until one day, when I unravelled. It was after the birth of my baby in my late 30s that life handed me more tasks than time. Having a baby is wonderful, but nothing prepares you for how many things you have to get done despite having little to no time to do them in, let alone get them done perfectly. Once I had muddled out of the post-partum fog, I realised to my utter shock that I was still expected to function as an adult and continue to do other things apart from just caring for my baby. Now, that wasn’t the problem — or at least it wasn’t the entire problem. The problem was that I couldn’t understand why I couldn’t do everything the way I did them before I had the baby.

1724,2025,The Hindu,1724,"The head on the temple | Column by Devdutt PattanaikPremium On the top of many Hindu temples, one finds the image of a head looking down on the people below — his eyes protruding from its sockets, his mouth wide open, his tongue out. This is called the Kirtimukha, the Head of Glory, or Vajramukha, the Eternal Head. There are many stories to explain its origins. The most popular is that of a goblin who was created by Shiva to kill demons. But when the demons apologised, Shiva forgave them. Now, the goblin was hungry and asked the lord for food. Shiva said, “Why don’t you eat your own body?” The creature began eating his hands, legs, and body, until there was nothing left. Impressed by his obedience, Shiva declared that his head would be placed on top of all temples, a symbol of insatiable hunger, devotion, and how useless the head is without the body — a counterpoint to when Brahmins claim they rose from the head of the Vedic Purusha, the primal man. There are other stories of this head. In goddess temples of North India, one finds the image of Bhairava (a fierce form of Shiva) holding in his hand the head of Brahma. It is said that at the dawn of time, the deity had four heads facing the four directions. But then he saw the goddess Shatarupa (the multi-formed one, the first woman) and grew a fifth head on top, expressing his desire for her. Disgusted by this, the goddess called upon Rudra to protect her, and thus Bhairava was born. He chopped off Brahma’s fifth head, and he still holds it in his hand. According to some lore, this head can be detached only when he goes to the city of Kashi and washes his hand in the Ganga. In Shiva temples, one finds the image of Veerabhadra holding a head in one hand. This is the head of Daksha Prajapati, who neither understood nor recognised the greatness of the lord, leading Veerabhadra, a terrifying creature born of Shiva’s hair, to behead him. Daksha was also the father-in-law of Shiva — the one whose daughter, Sati, chooses the lord as her husband against her father’s wishes.

Had they failed in Australia, Ajit Agarkar and company would have found it easier to say: sorry folks, it’s time to go. Had only one of them succeeded, the pressure on the other to quit would have been greater. Alternatively, it might have extended his career. After all, the selectors might take a chance with one of them for World Cup 2027, but both? While the countrycelebrated the Sydney ODI winand the manner in which the veterans — Rohit is 38, Kohli turns 37 in a few days — recaptured the past, the selectors were given a conundrum. It is not something they have to solve immediately, but they will have to handle it with no loss of dignity either to themselves or the two stalwarts. Very few Indian players have been allowed the luxury of choosing their time and place of departure. Sachin Tendulkar was given a send-off others can only dream of, with the whole country coming to a standstill, and with carefully chosen visitors — the West Indies — as sacrificial lambs. When announcing his retirement from One-Day Internationals earlier, Tendulkar had said, “I feel blessed to have fulfilled the dream of being part of a World Cup-winning Indian team.” That was a dream denied Rohit Sharma when, at 24, he was not picked for the 2011 World Cup at home. The selectors preferred an extra bowler, Piyush Chawla. Kohli was in the triumphant team and helped carry Tendulkar around the stadium after the win. In 2023, again at home, Rohit was now captain and India looked likely winners till they lost to Australia in the final. So there’s a bit of unfinished business in his case. The World Cup in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia commences in October, which means a five-month break after the IPL for the two players. Like they did with Test cricket and Tendulkar, India’s cricket board might decide to have a couple of unscheduled ODI series just to ensure the stalwarts keep in touch.

1726,2025,The Hindu,1726,"Column | Biblical tales in the PuranasPremium TheBhavishya Purana, or the chronicle of the future, is the earliest Sanskrit work that reveals some familiarity with West Asian myths. While presented as a prophecy of events that will happen during Kali Yuga, it seems to have been updated over time — from 1000 AD to late 18th century, and published around 1900. It ends with the arrival of British rule in Kolkata. Here, Queen Victoria is referred to as Viktavati. TheBhavishya Puranaimagines an India (Bharat-varsha) from the Himalayas to the sea, with the Indus or Sindhu-deshaforming the main barrier between Arya-desha, land of civilised folk, and Mleccha-desha, land of barbarians. In Bharat-varsha, the fourvarnasdo their duty. Sanskrit is spoken by the twice-born elites and Prakrit by the Shudras, or service-providers. Dravida-deshais to the south of the Vindhyas; therevarnastend to mix. In other local lore, Dravida-deshais the land without Kshatriyas, which Rishi Agastya and Rishi Parashurama organise and cultivate using the local Shudras. Like allPuranas, this text speaks of creation followed by the fouryugas. The firstyuga, Satya, was ruled by Ikshavaku kings. The second, Treta, was dominated by Solar kings and Ram of Ayodhya. The Dvaparayugawas ruled by a Lunar king ending with the infamous Mahabharata war. But there is a slight twist. Yayati’s children are founders not just of the Pandavas, Kauravas and Yadavas, but also of the Mlecchas, who are essentially those who turn away from Vedic rites, and take refuge in Maru-desha(probably the Thar desert). We are told of Satanika, the 23rd generation descendent of the Pandavas. His great grandson Kshemaka is killed by the Mlecchas. Kshemaka’s son Pradyota performs a great Mlecchayagnawhere hundreds of barbarians are slaughtered. Kshemaka’s son Vedavat died childless and that is when Kali Yuga actually begins.

Squinting hard in order to read on her archaic phone, Hudson quips, “What am I looking at?

Based on Richard Osman’s bestselling eponymous novel series,The Thursday Murder Clubfollows a group of senior citizen friends who live at the Cooper’s Chase retirement home in Kent — and solve cold cases together for fun. The central investigative trio is the whip-smart ex-spy Elizabeth (Helen Mirren), pugnacious ex-trade unionist Ron (Pierce Brosnan) and methodical retired psychiatrist Ibrahim (Ben Kingsley), with former nurse Joyce (Celia Imrie) being the Everyman audience-proxy introduced to the trio at the beginning of the film. This frequently amusing ‘cosy crime’ caper also utilises a rapidly growing trend in films, TV and literature in recent years — the elderly sleuth. What they lack in terms of youthful vigour, they more than make up for in wit, wisdom and resourcefulness. These help them operate in a world where the elderly are rendered invisible.

1729,2025,The Hindu,1729,"Column by Devdutt Pattanaik | The horseman of KanchiPremium At the Varadharaja Perumal temple in Kanchi (or Kanchipuram), there is an image of a horseman that is rather peculiar. On one side, it appears to be a South Indian Nayaka king, but on the other side it resembles a foreigner wearing trousers and a tunic. A foreign temple guardian, or mercenary, either Portuguese or Turk. The horsemen were known in Tamil Nadu as Ravuttan (horse riders), a term based on Rajput words such as Rawat and Raut (chieftain). Such guardian images are found in many temples of the Arcot and Mysuru regions. This may have inspired the “horse dance” known as “Poikkaal kuthirai aattam”, as well as terracotta horse image offerings to please folk deities such as Ayyanar. Carved in the 17th century by Nayaka kings, it reminds us of a time — until the 19th century — when horses were imported in vast numbers to India from Central Asia, Persia and Arabia. The ‘vilayati’ (foreign) Turki horses came by land for northern markets. North Indian kings would not allow horses go south to their rivals below the Vindhya mountains. So the south imported the ‘bahari’ Arabian horses by sea (bah’rmeans sea in Arabic). For over 3,000 years, horses were imported into India. They were critical to govern empires and, therefore, were always in demand. But a little known fact is that horses are difficult to breed in our country, which explains the need for annual imports. Local horse breeding did occur in pockets of Gujarat and Rajasthan about 800 years ago. This was to satisfy the demands of the Delhi sultans, when supply from Central Asia was cut following Mongol invasions. However, the local breeds (such as Tattu) were always considered inferior to the foreign ones (Turki, Tajiki). Kathiawar was one of the few places where foreign breeds could thrive in India. The Rig Veda contains some of the oldest horse poetry in the world. The horse is mentioned 200 times.

A defeat by a small margin, four runs in this case, always sets off speculation on where those runs might have come from in the course of  an innings. Ignored singles? Missed boundary? Luck? Mandhana made 88 in 94 balls. When she was fourth out in the 42nd over, India were still sitting pretty. They needed 55 in 53 balls, and with wickets in hand that was a comfortable target. Then things went haywire. The team’s confidence seemed to ooze out or turn into overconfidence. “We could have done with better shot selection,” admitted Mandhana, “It started from me, so I will take it on myself…” About being caught at long off, she said, significantly, “The emotions took over for that one…” That is understandable. Emotions are part of sport. There are two ways to handle these — either by controlling them and making them work for you, or by giving in to them and preparing for the inevitable disappointment. There is a simple rule in white ball chases, which the great players are conscious of: when you are settled in, bat on till the end. Don’t leave it to the next person. The opposition needs only to get a foot in the door before kicking it open. Especially teams like Australia, multi-champions who have been in this situation before and know that one wicket could lead to another and then yet another. For that is the rule for the bowling team: one wicket can make all the difference and alter the flow of the match. India were so near and yet so far in the ODI World Cup in 2017 and the T20 version in 2020. If they fail here now, it will mean that some of the senior players might not get another chance. That both the men’s and women’s teams lost on Sunday, but can redeem themselves on Thursday is one of those quirks of scheduling. But in a larger sense, the Indian men in Australia and the women against New Zealand in their next match can ",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/redemption-calls-for-self-belief-for-both-men-and-women/article70186062.ece

1732,2025,The Hindu,1732,"Column | Power of micro-dramasPremium In February this year, Kuku FM launched Kuku TV, a new vertical dedicated to micro-dramas — short-form TV shows with episodes lasting just a couple of minutes, shot entirely in vertical format for smartphone consumers. The platform features a vast catalogue of dubbed micro-dramas from around the world, alongside original in-house Hindi productions with titles such asRented Husband, Revenge of My Fake Boyfriend,andGumshuda Waris (The Missing Heir). Micro-dramas have emerged as a significant trend in the world of streaming since their inception about six years ago. According to a 2025 study by Omdia, Asia’s top five micro-drama apps, for instance, reached a cumulative MAU (monthly active users) total of 150 million. Today, most major streaming platforms have micro-drama projects in the pipeline, with smaller players like Kuku — and their American predecessors such as DramaBox and ReelShort — joining the fray. With attention spans shrinking in the age of endless scrolling, it’s easy to see why studio executives are placing big bets on this radically condensed storytelling format. How did creators and producers discover the potential of micro-dramas? It all began with data. After the initial streaming boom between 2013 and 2016, platforms took a step back to analyse vast amounts of viewer data collected over the years. They asked: what are people watching during the day, at night, during commutes, or just before bedtime? At what exact moment were viewers tuning out? How long do typical binge-watching sessions last? What’s the maximum episode length before viewership starts to drop? This treasure trove of data allowed streamers to come to certain ‘organic’ conclusions about our collective viewing habits, paving the way for the current wave of micro-dramas. In Hollywood, this business model gave rise to Quibi (2018-2020), a startup that has since become a cautionary tale in the streaming industry.

1733,2025,The Hindu,1733,"Anchoring or accelerating, Pujara was a great fit at No. 3Premium HadCheteshwar Pujarabeen in the team, it is possible India might have won the recent series in England. Once skipper Shubman Gill decided he was batting at No. 4, there was need for experience and resilience one slot above. India lacked a No. 3 capable of the long innings, someone who allowed their many stroke players to bat around him displaying neither ego nor envy. It might have been an imaginative selection. Admittedly, Pujara was 37, and his batting had been on the decline, despite two centuries and an average of 62 for Sussex. At any rate, it is easy to be wise after the event, and Pujara had already taken the well-trodden route from pitch to commentary box. But it is an intriguing might-have-been. Sometimes picking a 16-year-old is seen as an inspired selection; there aren’t too many at the other end of the scale. The late Bobby Simpson, recalled at 41, led Australia to a series win against India. Cyril Washbrook, then 41 and an England selector, was picked against Australia and scored 98 commenting drily, “another two would have done no harm.” England won. Pujara and his predecessor Rahul Dravid reinforced the traditional role of the No. 3, the one batting slot largely unaffected by the demands of T20 cricket. In the line-up, that position is the one associated with efficiency rather than style, pragmatism rather than romance. Walter Hammond, he of the silken cover drive, and occasionally the likes of Joe Root and Viv Richards have batted at three but Kumar Sangakkara, tough as nails, made the most runs from that position. He was the ideal modern No. 3 — left-handed, capable of both the long, defensive innings (he had 11 double centuries including a triple) and the short attacking one, and a superb reader of the game situation.

Phuphee grabbed herkeep(top part of the Kashmiriburqa) and the three of us ran into the village where everyone was gathered around Dar Sahab’s house.

As soon as the mother-in-law saw Phuphee, she started weeping and asking her to cure the girl of thejinn. The daughter-in-law, whose name was Shama, continued screaming, repeating the same thing over and over again: ‘Baeti ches insaan[I am also human].’ Phuphee went over to Shama and held her hands in her own until she started to calm down.

1735,2025,The Hindu,1735,"Brilliant Bavuma’s message for India: Be careful what you wish forPremium In the 2012-13 series against England, when skipper M.S. Dhoni asked for a turning track at Eden Gardens, the curator Prabhir Mukherjee told him this was “immoral.”Coach Gautam Gambhir’s instructions, however, were taken on board by Mukherjee’s successor,but India lostagain, making it four in six at home. Visiting spinners claiming more wickets than Indians on home tracks is not a recent phenomenon. India lost to Australia in 1969-70 despite fielding the great spinners Erapalli Prasanna (26 wickets), Bishan Bedi (21), and S. Venkatraghavan and better batters against spin in the line-up. Ashley Mallett (28) and John Glesson (10) were the successful spinners while medium pacers Graham McKenzie and Alan Connolly had 38 wickets between them. “Better batters against spin” turned out to be an exaggeration then, as it appears to be now. The Indian spinners kept telling their batters, as Bedi often reminded us, “Please give us at least 250 runs to bowl at.” In the last century, home tracks often challenged the home team. Richie Benaud (23 wickets to Vinoo Mankad’s 11 and Subhash Gupte’s 12) in 1956 (Australia won 2-0), Derek Underwood (29 to Bedi’s 25) in 1975-76 as England won 3-1 are other examples. Just over a decade ago, England won a series in India after 28 years thanks to Graeme Swann (20 wickets) and Monty Panesar (17). By themselves these statistics may not tell the whole story, but together they point to a pattern, perhaps suggesting the adage about spin in India might not necessarily be true. It is also useful to remember that just as India’s game against pace and swing while playing abroad has improved well enough to win them series in Australia and England, the preparation against spin by visiting teams has seen a sea-change too. Gambhir might have, by his own admission, got the wicket he wanted in Kolkata, but you have to be careful what you wish for.

1736,2025,The Hindu,1736,"Column by Saba Mahjoor | The curse of desirePremium On a beautiful spring day in April, a young woman walked into Phuphee’s garden. We had been tending to her garden since the early hours of the morning despite there having been a light shower. Phuphee was planting bulbs for lilies and freesias, which she hoped would bloom later on in the summer. When she was done, she stood over the flower beds and uttered a prayer, blowing over them repeatedly, invoking God to bless her with blooms. As soon as she spotted the young woman, she instructed one of the helpers to bring somekahwaandkandi kulchas(a chunky, sweet biscuit-like snack sprinkled with poppy seeds). She greeted the woman and invited her to follow her into her room. I waited, hoping she would ask me to join them but she didn’t. An hour later they came onto the verandah, the young woman’s eyes red rimmed and herkohlsmeared, but she didn’t look sad. I saw Phuphee rest her hand on the woman’s arm and whisper, ‘Hemath[strength]’. She smiled and left. A few days later I understood why the young woman had come over, and why Phuphee hadn’t invited me in. The woman, whose name was Zeenat, had caused an uproar in the district of Shopian. She had done the unthinkable: she had asked for akhula[divorce that is initiated by a woman] on the grounds that her husband was unable to carry out any intimate conjugal duties. Zeenat had been married for over two years, and had waited patiently for her husband to agree to seek further medical help. But he along with his family had flatly refused. As they put it, ‘It wasn’t possible for there to be anything wrong with their son’, despite Zeenat repeatedly showing them test results that proved otherwise. The in-laws put the blame squarely on her shoulders. She had been trying to convince him to see a specialist but he had refused saying, ‘If it was God’s will, it would happen.’ Upon hearing this, she had become frustrated and lost her temper.

1737,2025,The Hindu,1737,"When words are toast, and grockles go on holidayPremium Nabokov used the word ‘mauve’ at least once in all of his books. From this, many assume that was his favourite word. Jane Austen used ‘civility’ often, while unsurprisingly, Agatha Christie had more ‘inquest’ than others. I think it’s quite a leap to conclude these were the favourites of the respective authors. A better way of finding out would be to ask the authors the question: What is your favourite word? Ray Bradbury, author ofFahrenheit 451, when asked, said his favourite word was ‘cinnamon’. His explanation: “It derives from visiting my grandma’s pantry when I was a kid. I loved to read the labels on spice boxes; curries from far places in India and cinnamons from across the world.” For novelist and twice Booker winner Hilary Mantel, the word was ‘nesh’. I had to look it up. It means ‘unusually susceptible to cold weather’, and suggests weakness or infirmity, or as Mantel described it, “fragile, a bit sorry for yourself.” Author Rebecca Mead’s is ‘grockles’, another word I had to look up. It is, I learnt, a mildly derogatory term for visiting tourists and holidaymakers. We know such people, and now we know what they are called. Beautiful words tend to be a combination of something of personal significance, sound, memory, and possibilities. My own is ‘zephyr’, a soft gentle breeze, and when I hear it (which, admittedly is not very often), it evokes the visual of a casual wave of the hand over the shoulder which I once saw an actor do in a play. I don’t know why, but such things are not susceptible to logic. However, you can see how the combination of the ‘z’ and the ‘f’ sounds suggest something soothing and calm. Like the line in that Simon and Garfunkel song: “…freshly fallen, silent shroud of snow…” My wife’s word is ‘quintessential’, while a dear friend puts it down as ‘velvet’. Surveys that have been done over the years give us a list of much-loved words: murmuring, tranquil, gossamer, melody, ailurophile (cat lover). There are many more, of course.

1738,2025,The Hindu,1738,"India vs Pakistan | It’s ugly, but mock battles on field preferable to real ones off itPremium In his much-quoted essayThe Sporting Spirit, George Orwell wrote, “Serious sport has nothing to do with fair play. It is bound up with hatred, jealousy, boastfulness, disregard for rules and sadistic pleasure in witnessing violence: in other words, it is war minus the shooting.” Over the years, an India-Pakistan cricket match has been characterised as war minus the shooting, but seldom by the players, and rarely manifested on the field of play. When cricket relations resumed after 17 years and India toured Pakistan in 1978, the teams were led by Bishan Bedi and Mushtaq Mohammed, two contemporary greats who played together for Northamptonshire in England. They were firm friends. Yet even in that atmosphere, Cambridge-educated Majid Khan was quoted as saying, “Pakistan is ready for a 1,000-year war with India”. Those days there was no PR machinery that rushed to the aid of players to translate their plain English into palatable prose. No one attempted to interpret that to explain Majid meant “cricket war”, since sports contests were seen as proxies for war. Over the years, journalists from either country have returned to their own with stories of the warm reception they received and the generosity of their hosts. On the 1989-90 tour of Pakistan, when I expressed a desire to visit Mohenjo-daro, I was flown there as a guest, provided with a guide, and taken around. Perhaps the guide was a security person to ensure I didn’t do anything his bosses wouldn’t approve of. No matter, since my interest was historical, not political. On most tours, writers came back with stories of stores refusing to accept money if they bought anything. “Over the years, an India-Pakistan cricket match has been characterised as war minus the shooting, but seldom by the players, and rarely manifested on the field of play.” It wasn’t all sweetness and light, of course.

1739,2025,The Hindu,1739,"BJP rakes up controversy over Telangana CM Revanth’s remarks comparing diversity in Hinduism with Congress’s political culture A political controversy has erupted in Telangana after Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy’s casual remarks referring to Hindu gods during an internal Congress meeting went viral, prompting sharp reactions from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS). While addressing the newly appointed District Congress Committee (DCC) chiefs and other senior leaders on Tuesday (December 2, 2025), Mr. Reddy drew a parallel between the diversity within the party and the plurality within Hinduism. In his signature informal style, the Chief Minister said Hindu dharma accommodates nearly three crore deities, offering a god for every occasion and every situation. He cited examples saying that there are deities associated with bachelors like Lord Hanuman, and others such as Pochamma, Maisamma and Yellamma, whom people worship with celebration, enjoyment and drinking. “Just as Hinduism has a god to suit every mentality, the Congress too has space for every viewpoint,” he said, adding that this inclusiveness was the key to the party’s 140-year survival. Mr. Reddy urged the newly appointed DCC presidents to be accommodating and adjust to differing opinions within the party, irrespective of personal beliefs. However, once the remarks surfaced online, political opponents seized upon the references to gods associated with different situation and occasion, accusing the Chief Minister of mocking Hindu faith and beliefs. Clips of the speech were widely shared by the BJP and its followers amplifying the reach. The BJP reacted strongly, with Union Minister of State for Home Bandi Sanjay alleging that “insulting Hindu gods is the culture of the Congress” and claimed that the remarks reflected the party’s inclination to “prostrate before the AIMIM while insulting Hindus.” He reiterated his earlier warning during the Jubilee Hills byelection campaign, saying that a Congress victory would undermine Hindu dignity, and called upon Hindus to unite.

1740,2025,The Hindu,1740,"IND vs SA Tests: Let’s give South Africa credit for being the better all-round teamPremium To lose one home Test might be a misfortune, but tolose possibly fiveis carelessness, to adapt Oscar Wilde. So what ails India? When a team loses two home series (0-3 against New Zealand, possibly 0-2 against South Africa), there are multiple reasons. But one that hasn’t been emphasised enough in the recent setback is the obvious one: South Africa are the better team. The World Test champions have outplayed India in every department. Simon Harmer is the finest off-spinner to have toured in a long time. It has been a treat watching him draw out the batter, play the angles, now spinning, now going straight through, at all times attacking. Modern spinners tend to focus on one of two things – spin or bounce. Harmer controls both with the easy confidence of someone with over a thousand First Class wickets. What of team selection then? Could India have fielded a more balanced side, with specialists in each slot? Perhaps. But eight of the team pick themselves as the best at their jobs. Dhruv Jurel deserved a look-in for his recent record, especially against South Africa-A, and the Sai Sudarshan experiment at No. 3 needed to be persisted with, especially at home. The loss of skipper and lead batter Shubman Gill certainly made a difference. He prefers the No. 4 slot, although he could be the ideal No.3. The Indian coach sees something in Nitish Reddy that is not apparent to the naked eye, but Nitish has the opportunity to turn things around on the final day, if against all odds India manage to draw the Test. What about the coach? Gautam Gambhir is not above criticism. He gets defensive at media questions, has come into conflict with curators recently, and gives the impression of being somehow superior to those who ask questions of him. None of this would have mattered had India won their home Tests, but when the results go against the team, the coach’s attitude comes under the lens. At the best of times, he is a convenient scapegoat anyway.

She was nearly done when one of the helpers came in to inform her that a lady was waiting for her. She motioned for me to join her and directed the helper to cook extra rice for lunch. In Phuphee’s room, a woman was waiting. She lived locally. Her name was Asma. She was the headmistress of a small girls school on the outskirts of the village.

1742,2025,The Hindu,1742,"Column by Devdutt Pattanaik | How Vasudeva became VishnuPremium At Malhar, a small town near Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh, we find an image of a soldier with four arms, holding a conch shell, a wheel and a mace. It has been identified as the earliest image of Vishnu. The inscription on the stone has been dated to 200 BC. It records that the image was consecrated by Bharadvaja, the wife of Parnadatta, a governor of the Saurashtra region in the Gupta period. This makes it the earliest example of a woman donor in Indian art. Malhar lay on an ancient trade route connecting Kaushambi to Puri, a corridor of commerce and culture. In all probability, this is not a Vishnu image. It is an image of Vasudeva-Krishna of theMahabharata, who displays his four-armed form to Arjuna. The Malhar Vishnu, though simple and rather unremarkable, captures a transitional moment when the heroic Vasudeva was slowly turning into the divine Vishnu of the temples. Until the identification of the Malhar Vasudeva, the oldest known images of Krishna were small Indo-Greek coins from Afghanistan, also dating to 200 BC, that show two men standing side by side. One holds a mace and a conch, the other a plough and a club. The Greek legends call them Sankarshana and Vasudeva, i.e., Balarama and Krishna. The foreign ‘Yavana’ kings, ruling from Afghanistan and Punjab, saw how popular the Indian hero-gods were and struck coins to honour them. Around the same time, inscriptions on the Heliodorus pillar in Madhya Pradesh (the 2nd century BCE sandstone column built by the Greek ambassador Heliodorus in honour of Vishnu) speak of devotion to Vasudeva-Krishna. This is where the journey begins — of the rise of Vishnu from Vasudeva, 2,200 years ago. The 2,200-year-old Vishnu-Krishna at the Malhar archaeological museum

I had known heartbreaks and disappointments, but most of my life I had somehow managed to stay away from grief. I can tell you one thing about it though, even if it arrives by simply ringing the doorbell in a polite manner, by the time it leaves, it will have done its best to raze the house to the ground. On a cold January morning, nearly a decade ago, grief arrived and pitched its camp in my home. My maternal grandfather passed away early in the morning. He was in his late 80s and had, over the last years of his life, become unwell. His passing wasn’t wholly unexpected and yet it felt like it was. It is difficult to explain how I felt but it was like after deciding to rise that morning, the sun had thought that this world really didn’t deserve it anymore, and at around 10.30 a.m. it had dived back into bed, plunging the world in complete darkness. I don’t have many clear memories of the aftermath; mostly I remember sleeping. I would wake up from time to time to eat something and then I would sleep again. The minute I would be awake, the fact that he was gone would hit me and I would feel like I was falling through a dark tunnel. Sometimes I would think that it would be a relief if at the end of this fall, I too could just die and I waited for that to happen. But it didn’t. It frightened and angered me that I could carry so much grief and pain, and yet my organs still had the audacity to keep doing what they were supposed to. I spent weeks falling through this dark tunnel, hoping and wishing for an end, but it never came. Instead, one day the doorbell rang and though I tried to ignore it, it rang incessantly until I opened the door and in walked Phuphee. She said she had come because she had missed talking to me after I had refused to speak to her on the phone. I understood that the rest of the family must have told her.

1744,2025,The Hindu,1744,"Column by Saba Mahjoor | When two sisters split a villagePremium During the course of my life, I have watched Phuphee work through countless cases and offer each one a tailored solution. But there was one that remained unsolvable. The case involved two sisters who had a feud that had been ongoing for 25 years. My earliest memory of them is from when I was 14 or 15. It had been a hot, humid day and I had been too lazy to follow Phuphee into her room when they had arrived. That was the only time I saw them together. After that, it was always one or the other at the house. Over the years their feud intensified, at times causing everyone in the village to go into a tizzy and talk of nothing else and, at other times, they were as silent as the graveyard. The villagers would sometimes talk about how the feud had started, but no one ever really knew what it was that had set the two at each other’s throats. With time, it wasn’t just the sisters who were fighting but their families. As each sister’s family had expanded, so had the boundary of the feud. And once their immediate family members were in the fight club, the conflict slowly made its way into the village. The strange malady caused the people to express allegiance to one sister or the other even though it was never explicitly demanded by anyone. The villagers sometimes found themselves getting into arguments and heated debates with their friends about the siblings. By the time the person would recover their senses, the damage had been done. Sometimes people speculated that the sisters were cursed and kept their distance, but then the enticing aroma of gossip would tickle their noses and draw them in and the cycle would start all over again. One day in late September, my parents planned to drop me off at Phuphee’s house for a couple of days.

While India has a normative privacy framework in terms of thePuttaswamyjudgment (2017); the Information Technology Act, 2000 and its Intermediary Guidelines; and the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, and Rules, the reality of privacy remains opaque. We now live in a fishbowl society where we are gauging ‘harm’ from a myopic lens of privacy and dignity instead of obscurity. As Meredith Broussard notes in her bookArtificial Unintelligence, society’s over-reliance on technology is leaving us ill-prepared to cope with the very systems we have built. This not only exposes individuals to the risks of data breach but also pushes them into obscurity, especially in cases of Non-Consensual Intimate Image Abuse (NCII), where algorithms generate deepfake pornographic images without one’s knowledge or control. Regulating such an assault is an urgent legal and policy imperative. The conventional frameworks for addressing such abuses are inadequate. Traditional approaches often describe risks of any such surveillance as loss of privacy, when in reality it is many more things as well: anxiety, chronic fear of being watched, victim blaming and shaming, societal stigma, career stagnation, permanent loss of autonomy, and bodily integrity. Surprisingly, despite cybercrimes being on the rise, there is no contemporary data on NCII. Data of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) puts all cybercrimes in one category, without any granular classification of specific offences. We filed an Right to Information application on October 3, 2025 seeking information on the number of cases registered in the previous year relating specifically to cyberbullying and cybervoyeurism, along with the gender-wise distribution of victims.

1746,2025,The Hindu,1746,"India’s disaster response, a slippery slope for federalismPremium The inter-governmental transfer of resources for disaster response reveals a growing asymmetry between the Union and the States of India, reflected in the widening gap between assessed needs and actual disbursements. This imbalance, seen most recently in the Centre’s release of funds to Kerala after the Wayanad landslides, raises a critical question. Is India’s fiscal federal structure shifting from a cooperative to a more conditional and centralised model of disaster-risk finance? The tragedy in Wayanad, in July 2024, which claimed nearly 300 lives and destroyed thousands of homes, brought sharp focus to this issue. Against Kerala’s loss of ₹2,200 crore, the Union approved only ₹260 crore, barely 11% (₹1,200 crore is the estimated loss while ₹2,200 crore is sought by the State in the memorandum for recovery). This mismatch, not unique to Kerala, signals an erosion of cooperative federalism. Disasters today are fiscal stress tests for States, and as climate shocks intensify, India’s disaster-financing framework is showing visible strain. India’s disaster-response financing framework, established under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, rests on a two-tier structure. The State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), financed jointly by the Centre and States in a 75:25 ratio, 90:10 for Himalayan and north-eastern States, provides immediate relief for shelter, food, medical care and compensation. The National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), fully funded by the Union government, supplements this when a calamity is classified as severe. In principle, the design appears balanced, but in practice, it has drifted towards central control.

This is also an opportune time to ask how far we have realised Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s immortal words — “Sujalam, Suphalam, Malayaja sheetalam, Sasya-shyamalam (translated as clear-watered, rich in fruits, cooled by mountain breeze, lush and green with its fields of harvest”). Down the ages, India’s environment has been critical to its becoming the cradle of one of the world’s great civilisations. India’s population and its fertility rate owe much to the fertility of its soil, which was able to provide abundant harvests to support a large population. Even as India’s land area comprises just 2.4% of the land in the world, the Convention on Biological Diversity testifies that India is home to about 8% of the world’s species. Over 91,200 species of animals and 45,500 species of plants are found in India. And such has been the reliability of India’s rain-bearing winds that even before India gained independence, the renowned geographer Halford Mackinder spoke of the country as a ‘Monsoon power’ that will shape the future of the world. How have we safeguarded elements of this priceless environmental heritage that birthed our civilisation — Sujalam, Suphalam, Malayaja sheetalam? India’s life-giving rivers are in deep crisis.Nearly 43% of river monitoring systems have found traces of heavy metal contamination. The level of pesticide content in several Indian rivers is well above permissible limits. InGlobal Water Quality rankings, India ranks 120 out of 122 countries.

1748,2025,The Hindu,1748,"A former Minister and his ‘vada case’Premium Covering court proceedings is exciting for reporters for the sheer variety it offers. Unlike other specialised beats, it gives us the opportunity to follow developments on everything under the sun. A legal correspondent is privy to fine arguments by the best legal minds on constitutional provisions, issues of governance, interpretations of law in criminal cases, spirited public interest litigation, and, of course, judicial sermons. What is truly thrilling, though, is covering criminal trial proceedings. This is where a reporter encounters the ingenuity of criminal lawyers, the desperation of the accused, the smartness or sometimes even collusion of state prosecutors, the innocence of witnesses, and the straight-faced court staff. Interesting courtroom encounters became staple fare when the M. Karunanidhi regime in Tamil Nadu (1996-2001) set up three special courts in Chennai to try 46 corruption cases against former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, some of her erstwhile Cabinet colleagues, and IAS and IPS officers. The trials were conducted daily. The accused and their lawyers tried every trick to prolong the proceedings. Many of us would see accused politicians suddenly fall sick on crucial hearing dates. Fed up with such tactics, a special judge once went to a hospital, with lawyers, court staff, and journalists in tow, to frame charges against a former Minister, who was lying in bed. In another case, just as the judge began to read out the charges, Jayalalithaa sneezed loudly. For a moment, everyone in the courtroom believed she was in real distress. She kept sneezing until the judge finished his part. K.A. Sengottaiyan, one of Jayalalithaa’s fiercest loyalists and a former Transport Minister, was facing three cases then.

1749,2025,The Hindu,1749,"A farm crisis lost in political cacophonyPremium It has been over 10 days since farmers of Gadag district in north Karnataka began an indefinite agitation demanding Minimum Support Price (MSP) of ₹3,000 per quintal for maize. Farmers in the neighbouring districts too are up in arms against the Central and State governments over the plummeting price of maize. While the Centre has fixed an MSP at ₹2,400 per quintal for maize, the prevailing price in Karnataka is ₹1,600 to ₹1,800 per quintal. The prices, which began declining in September, have dropped suddenly over the last fortnight. The plight of the farmers in Karnataka, which is among the top maize-producing States in the country, seems to have been buried under the cacophony over the “power-sharing formula” between the Chief Minister, Siddaramaiah, and the Deputy Chief Minister, D.K. Shivakumar. The protest by maize farmers comes at a time when the State government is yet to recover from the floods that destroyed crops. That was followed by series of protests by sugarcane farmers seeking a Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of ₹3,500 per tonne for sugarcane. The State government recently managed to convince the farmers to agree to an FRP of ₹3,300 per tonne. The Opposition BJP has been quick to grab this opportunity to portray the ruling disposition as “anti-farmer”, just ahead of the winter session of the State legislature. In response, the Congress has argued that the Union government’s intervention is crucial in resolving both maize and sugarcane issues. It has mocked the opposition MPs of Karnataka for not having the gumption to raise the issue with their own party leaders at the Centre. Last week, Mr. Siddaramaiah wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking his intervention in the procurement of maize and also green gram, which has seen a price drop as well.

But for this minor job, they have forced me, through humiliation, to die... I have completed almost 95% of the offline work, but I cannot manage anything online.” These words, from a note by a Booth Level Officer (BLO), should shake the conscience of any democratic society. Before her life faded away, she wrote a line — that none of her family members was responsible for her death. Yet, no proceedings have been initiated, suo motu, to examine the role of the Election Commission of India (ECI) in the circumstances that allegedly led to her despair. This silence is deeply troubling. There is no doubt that West Bengal required a Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of its electoral rolls as there are fake entries, names of deceased individuals, and — according to multiple reports— the names of infiltrators. Once the SIR process began, many infiltrators were said to have tried to cross the border to exit. The fault of allowing such infiltration lies principally with the Border Security Force, followed by the State police, and by political networks that helped irregular applicants acquire voter cards. But the validity of the SIR does not justify the manner in which it is being executed. An exercise that took two full years, in 2002, is now expected to be completed in less than two months, despite the manifold increase in the number of voters. This compression of time has resulted in BLOs facing immense pressure, many of whom are schoolteachers or para-teachers engaged in modestly paid contractual work. From the day the SIR began, signs of the ECI’s unpreparedness became evident. Voters have faced inconvenience, but the brunt of the crisis has been borne by BLOs. Apart from rigid deadlines, they face political pressure, particularly from Booth Level Agents of the ruling party. Several BLOs have fallen ill; some have died.

No one who values humanity can remain untouched by such loss. As Kashmiris, we have lived through the pain of violence for decades and, therefore, understand better than most what it means for families to lose loved ones, suddenly and brutally. Every act of violence against the innocent is unacceptable and no cause or ideology can ever justify it. Yet, while we mourn, it is troubling to see how quickly such tragedies are converted into sensational narratives. Even before investigations establish facts, sections of the media are quoting “inside sources” and are ready with headlines that cast suspicion on a particular community and religion. This rush to judge not only misleads the public but also places an entire population under scrutiny — especially Kashmiri students and professionals living across India, who suddenly find themselves being treated as suspects. Fear replaces safety, and anxiety grips families back home. Condemnation of acts of terror must not be allowed to transform itself into collective punishment. Unfortunately, this has become a recurrent pattern in Jammu and Kashmir. In recent years, we have seen houses, the homes of aging parents, spouses and children, being blown up or demolished because a family member was accused of supporting militancy. A house is not just a structure. It represents dignity, belonging and memories. Destroying it punishes those who have committed no crime. Similarly, detaining or harassing relatives and the acquaintances of suspected militants is neither justice nor strategy. It spreads anger and pain further.

1752,2025,The Hindu,1752,"Tackling Kerala’s mental health challengePremium Deaths by suicide have become a subject of discussion in Kerala. The topic entered public discourse after several individuals, including police officers, ended their lives due to political and administrative pressures. There is no doubt that those responsible for the immediate causes of these tragedies must be held accountable. However, this debate cannot be restricted to politics alone; we must acknowledge that the underlying cause of the rising suicide rate is the fragile mental health of the Kerala population, and adopt urgent remedial measures. Kerala has among the highest suicide rates in the country. According to the 2022 National Crime Records Bureau report, the national average suicide rate per one lakh population was 12.4, while in Kerala, it was 28.5. Only Sikkim (43.1) ranked higher. Studies conducted on the mental health status of Kerala’s population present a worrying picture. There was a dramatic increase in mental health issues, from 272 per thousand in 2008 to 400 per thousand by 2018, as stated by the 2021 study, ‘The burden of mental health illnesses in Kerala: a secondary analysis of reported data from 2002 to 2018’, conducted by Jaison Joseph, D. Hari Shankar and Devaki Nambiar. This suggests that a vast section of Kerala’s population is facing severe mental health challenges, with an estimated 12% suffering from severe mental illnesses that necessitate hospital treatment and care. The contrast with the national trend is stark, where the number of individuals with mental health issues either decreased or remained stable in the same period. This suggests that while the mental health sector has seen progress nationally, the problem has intensified in Kerala.

1753,2025,The Hindu,1753,"A template for security cooperation in the Indian OceanPremium On November 20, 2025, India hosted the 7th National Security Advisor-level summit of the Colombo Security Conclave (CSC). India’s National Security Adviser, Ajit Doval, hosted his counterparts from other member-countries, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Mauritius and Bangladesh, while counterparts from Seychelles and Malaysia were observer state and guest, respectively. The CSC has sought to position itself as a critical forum to promote and foster cooperation in the domain of security in the Indian Ocean region. Initiated as a trilateral grouping between India, Sri Lanka and Maldives in 2011, the group lost steam in light of the political transition in the Maldives and Sri Lanka, and lack of convergence among the member-states to identify priorities in security cooperation in the Indian Ocean. The group reconvened its engagement under the aegis of the CSC in 2020, a proposed framework to further cooperation in maritime security, counter-terrorism, trafficking and organised crime and cybersecurity. Since then, the group has remained steady in not just maintaining momentum among its member-states but also inducting countries. In 2022, Mauritius joined as a full member, while in 2024, the group saw the admission of Bangladesh. For India, the summit, in 2025, comes at a pivotal moment. Frameworks of cooperation in the maritime domain, in the broader Indo-Pacific, and indeed in the Indian Ocean appear to be undergoing a crucial shift. Given the focus of the CSC on non-traditional issues of maritime security, it is vital to bolster cooperation in mitigating the looming challenges. While the Indian Ocean maritime security architecture remains fragmented due to the lack of any singular institutional framework, groups such as the CSC must remain committed to enhancing cooperation in this regard.

1754,2025,The Hindu,1754,"The INO that wasn’t and the JUNO that isPremium China has finished building itsJiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory(JUNO), a bittersweet development given that the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) has been in limbo for years. Both JUNO and INO were designed to studysubatomic particles called neutrinos, which are very hard to catch because they rarely interact with matter. This is why both INO and JUNO are huge: the more matter there is, the more interactions there will be between neutrinos and matter, and thus more opportunities for study. However, this size was perhaps the original trigger of the INO’s downfall, so to speak, in India. Because the INO detector was so massive (weighing 50 kilotonnes), it could not be operated from inside a lab nor could scientists situate its detector in an existing facility. Instead, the INO collaboration had planned to install the detector inside a mountain in Theni in Tamil Nadu, together with other research facilities. The mountain’s rock was to serve as a natural shield for the detector, obviating the need for a separate structure, which would have been expensive. However, the scale of the construction activity in the area and the involvement of the Department of Atomic Energy, which was helping fund the project, spooked the locals and spurred local leaders to draw political mileage from that. The INO collaboration also erred (in hindsight) by not following procedure and by not estimating how controversial the project could become, which, if it had done, would have helped it respond to and manage certain public sentiments better. In the late 2010s, these delays were painful as China moved in leaps to realise JUNO. The ‘pain’ was because the INO collaboration was hoping to secure a limited pool of grants and investments from foreign governments to operate the detector. China expected to complete JUNO by 2020 but that turned out to be five years too soon.

It has exposed long-standing differences among senior leaders, and thrown up questions over adherence to organisational norms as well as concerns about the party’s strategic direction as it prepares for the crucial local body and Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation elections. While the Congress high command framed these appointments as an exercise in social engineering and organisational restructuring, the selections have left several leaders dissatisfied, particularly in politically sensitive districts. Broadly, the list of new DCC presidents has raised eyebrows because several of the appointees are neither widely known nor influential in their respective districts. The leadership has claimed that the selections were aimed at strengthening Backward Classes representation and ensuring a gender balance. A major flashpoint arose with the appointment of Kailash Netha as DCC president of Nalgonda. Congress Minister Komatireddy Venkata Reddy gave a written complaint to Chief Minister Revanth Reddy demanding his removal. He reminded the party that Mr. Netha had abused him during the Munugode bypoll when the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) was in power. Also, Nalgonda district, known for its long tradition of strong Reddy leadership and Scheduled Tribe population and historically significant Congress figures, reacted strongly to the choice.

India has taken a giant leap in labour rights with the implementation of four modernised Labour Codes (the Code on Wages, 2019, the Industrial Relations Code, 2020, the Code on Social Security, 2020 and the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions (OSH) Code, 2020). These reforms create a fair, modern and future-ready labour ecosystem — one that empowers workers, enhances enterprise competitiveness and strengthens India’s path towards a Viksit Bharat and Aatmanirbhar Bharat. India’s labour framework has evolved gradually over several decades, leading to the creation of multiple pieces of legislation operating across different time periods and economic contexts. While these laws have played an important role in shaping employment relations, the growing size and diversity of India’s workforce brought to the fore the need for simplification and consolidation. The Second National Commission on Labour recommended grouping existing laws into broader functional codes. Extensive consultations with industry, employers, trade unions and State governments between 2015 and 2019 led to these four comprehensive Labour Codes being enacted.  India today has one of the world’s largest and youngest workforces, with more than 643 million workers, and is expected to contribute nearly two-thirds of new global workforce entrants in the coming years, as in the World Economic Forum. Recent labour market trends point to a positive momentum: between 2017-18 and 2023-24, India created 16.83 crore jobs, the unemployment rate declined from 6% to 3.2%, and formal employment expanded significantly.

1757,2025,The Hindu,1757,"Bridging India’s numeracy gapPremium The National Education Policy 2020 rightly identifies Foundational Literacy and Numeracy (FLN) as the cornerstone of all future learning. The NIPUN Bharat Mission has translated this policy intent into action by focusing on learning outcomes rather than just inputs. Foundational learning outcomes — stagnant for decades — have shown measurable improvement, as confirmed by government as well as independent surveys. Despite these gains, numeracy continues to lag behind literacy. The Annual State of Education Report 2024 report shows that while 48.7% of Class 5 students can read fluently, only 30.7% can solve a basic division problem — an 18% point gap. No State reports higher numeracy than literacy outcomes. This situation makes it essential to examine numeracy more closely on the path to achieving foundational learning. The root of the numeracy problem lies in the cumulative nature of mathematics. Unlike language learning, where partial comprehension allows some progress, math is hierarchical and builds on itself. A missed concept in the lower grades, such as place value, can make future concepts like addition and decimals inaccessible. As a result, once gaps form, they tend to widen over time. Traditional syllabus-driven teaching worsens the issue, as it advances without ensuring that students have grasped earlier concepts. Research and field experience from Teaching at the Right Level, an approach developed by the NGO Pratham, show that instruction must be aligned with a child’s learning level rather than the curriculum. Without remedial interventions, grade-level teaching simply bypasses most learners, deepening existing disparities. This gap is also evident in the disconnect between school learning and real-life application. A study by the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab shows that students who perform well on classroom math assessments often struggle to apply that knowledge in real-life market situations.

The countries that turned science into industry did one thing well: they matched firm outlays to campus strengths and kept that link steady for years. The policy question is clear. How do we move private research outlays from episodic Corporate Social Responsibility to a predictable pipeline that buys lab time, funds doctoral cohorts, and books pilot lines? Leading tech firms run innovation budgets at industrial scale. In 2024, Meta’s research outlay reached about $44 billion, near a third of revenue. Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, IBM, and Microsoft also reported multibillion-dollar programmes. In the U.S., enterprises booked roughly $692 billion of domestic research against about $14 trillion in net sales in 2022, a ratio near 5%. Policy instruments translate that investment into campus partnerships. The National Science Foundation’s Industry-University Cooperative Research Centers pool company fees for pre-competitive university work. The Semiconductor Research Corporation funds multi-university consortia that train talent while tackling industry-relevant problems. China’s Huawei reported an R&D expenditure at 179.7 billion yuan in 2024, equal to 20.8% of revenue. More than half of Huawei’s workforce is in R&D roles. Build Your Dreams , a Chinese multinational auto company, invested 54.2 billion yuan in 2024 on R&D against roughly 777 billion yuan of revenue, an intensity of nearly 7%. These examples demonstrate one trait. Corporate research works with campuses through joint centres, shared lines, long-horizon consortia and open talent pipelines.

The students’ complaint, filed on September 12, 2024, was investigated, and the allegations of sexual harassment were proven. While this outcome is being hailed as “justice served”, it also exposes the low conviction rate under the POSH Act and the gaps that prevent it from delivering justice with consistency and empathy, especially in educational institutions where young women and men face unequal power dynamics. This writer has seen the recurring gaps and on-ground challenges that dilute the purpose of the law after having witnessed several cases of sexual harassment in universities and colleges. The Act, though well-intentioned, suffers from conceptual and procedural flaws. It talks about “consent” but not “informed consent”. That distinction is crucial. Consent loses its meaning when obtained through manipulation or incomplete knowledge. Within workplace and academic settings, relationships may initially appear consensual, but when emotional manipulation or power imbalance surfaces later, the earlier consent becomes invalid. What a woman experiences then is not only harassment but also betrayal.

Many countries in this region had prevalence rates that were in double digits. With no treatment at that time, almost everyone infected with HIV developed AIDS in a few years and “opportunistic infections” such as tuberculosis (TB) or diarrhoea, which resulted in high levels of mortality. By the early 1990s, India was in a similar situation, with HIV prevalent in almost all parts of the country — though below 1% of the adult population, mainly transmitted through unprotected heterosexual sex, except in a few north-eastern States where it was transmitted through the sharing of needles by youngsters addicted to narcotic drugs. The Government of India responded quickly and launched the National AIDS Control Project in 1992 with a soft loan of $84 million from the World Bank. Every State government set up an AIDS Cell in the respective medical directorates. But fund flow through the Central and then the State government machinery was very slow. A solution was found in 1994 by Tamil Nadu. The State AIDS Cell was converted into a Registered Society named the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society or TNSACS (www.tnsacs.in) under the Societies Registration Act.

They alleged that AI-generated videos portraying them in fictitious and often explicit scenarios infringe upon their personality rights, resulting in reputational and financial damage. They sought compensation, but also safeguards to prevent such content from being used to train future AI models. This case highlights how AI blurs the lines between authenticity and deception, prompting us to reassess the legal and ethical frameworks governing personality rights. Personality rights, which include the right to control one’s name, image, likeness, voice, and other identifiers of identity, have long been a bulwark against unauthorised exploitation. Rooted in concepts of privacy, dignity, and economic autonomy, these rights evolved from common law principles to address commercial exploitation. However, the emergence of AI, particularly in the form of generative technologies such as deepfakes, has amplified these vulnerabilities. Deepfakes, AI-generated content that swap faces or voices, propagate misinformation, enable extortion, and erode trust. While AI fosters innovation, its unchecked use risks commodifying human identity, demanding legal safeguards. Globally, personality rights differ: Europe adopts a dignity-based model, the U.S. a property-based one, and India a hybrid approach. In India, these rights lack codification and stem from Article 21 of the Constitution, affirmed inJustice K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India(2017). Courts have since classified AI infringements as privacy or intellectual property breaches. Landmark cases includeAmitabh Bachchan v. Rajat Nagi(2022), which recognised personality rights;Anil Kapoor v.

1762,2025,The Hindu,1762,"Key constitutional fixes that India’s cities still needPremium Constitution Day (November 26) is a reminder not only of the remarkable framework created for the governance of the country in 1950 but also of how the document has evolved to meet India’s changing needs. Since its adoption, the Constitution has been amended over 100 times, though only a few have been truly structural — such as the introduction of Fundamental Duties under Article 51A, the constitutionalisation of the Right to Education, the anti-defection provisions, and the twin reforms of the 73rd and 74th Amendments that recognised the rural and urban local governments (ULGs) as institution as of self-governance through Parts IX and IX-A. These additions have been significant steps towards deepening democracy and inclusive development. Yet, while the 73rd Amendment revitalised panchayati raj institutions, the 74th Amendment — meant to empower ULGs — has fallen far short of its transformative promise. India’s cities continue to grapple with water scarcity, slums, choked roads, rising pollution and disasters such as flooding. Despite contributing to two-thirds of India’s GDP and housing over a third of its population, its cities continue to be strained without real autonomy, disempowered elected leadership, weak finances and fragmented service delivery. The 74th Amendment offered a framework but left critical details to State discretion. That discretion, in practice, translated into dilution. Over 30 years on, most States still hold back powers, functions and finances from municipal governments. No nation has achieved prosperity with such weak city institutions. Therefore, a second generation of constitutional reforms is imperative. To begin with, mayors and municipal chairpersons must be guaranteed a stable and meaningful five-year term. Article 243R(2)(b) leaves the term of office to the discretion of States, resulting in wide variation: from five-year terms in some States to a single year in Delhi, and two-and-a-half-year terms in Mumbai and Bengaluru.

In an industry where people revel in holding on to a popular image, Palekar has invested a lifetime challenging established conventions and norms. Days after the Supreme Court decided to examine his seven-year-old plea questioning pre-censorship in films, Palekar hopes it will be taken up soon. “I hope it is heard when I am still alive,” the 80-year-old deadpanned, for his separate petition on pre-censorship in theatre has been pending in the Mumbai High Court since 2017. Known for his committed stance on social issues, Palekar says it is the government’s “duty to protect the art and the artist” and tell those “creating nuisance to shut up.” “The government can’t give in to trolls on social media and absolve itself from its duty to safeguard the freedom of expression,” he contends. Though he never wanted to be stuck with the boy-next-door image ofGol Maal’s protagonist, the title of his memoir reflects his deep association with director Hrishikesh Mukherjee. The “viewfinder” refers to Bimal Roy’s device , which Mukherjee, Roy’s disciple, passed on to Palekar to discover his cinematic universe. Palekar was more fascinated by the kaleidoscopic view from a young age and created his ownDaayraa(The Square Circle, 1996). “How with a simple twist, the pattern inside changes attracted me.

A Bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said the matter be posted for hearing as and when the three-Judge Bench is constituted. “This matter requires to be heard by a three-Judge Bench,” the Bench said. The Supreme Court had earlier appointed senior advocate Siddharth Luthra as an amicus curiae for assistance in the matter. The Supreme Court on September 8 had taken note of the Kerala High Court’s “regular practice” of entertaining anticipatory bail applications directly without the litigant moving the sessions court. “One issue which in bothering us is, in the Kerala High Court there seems to be a regular practice that the High Court entertains the anticipatory bail applications directly without the litigant approaching the sessions court. Why is that so?” the Bench had asked. It had said there was a hierarchy provided in the erstwhile Code of Criminal Procedure and the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023. Section 482 of the BNSS deals with direction for grant of bail to person apprehending arrest. “It doesn’t happen in any other state.

The Supreme Court’s observation came while hearing a plea by two men challenging a Kerala High Court order rejecting their plea for anticipatory bail. The Bench noted in the case, the petitioners directly moved the High Court for the relief without first going to the sessions court.

1766,2024,The Hindu,1766,"The milk-sisters of Oman | Interview with author Jokha Alharthi on her new novelSilken Gazelles Omani writer Jokha Alharthi’s new novel,Silken Gazelles(Simon & Schuster), translated from the Arabic by Marilyn Booth, begins dramatically. A woman is suddenly told of her father’s death; and as she gives a loud wail, her baby girl, Layla, who she had been clutching, falls out of her hands, and lands into the arms of one of the mourners. The mourner, Saada, has a 10-month-old child of her own—Asiya, and as she offers her breast to the child she plucks from the air, she names her Ghazaala, or gazelle. Alharthi, who won the 2019 Man Booker International Prize, along with translator Marilyn Booth, for her novelCelestial Bodies, deftly tells the story of the milk-sisters in her new book, and of their journey from village to city, the changes they encounter, and the grief they carry. Edited excerpts from an interview: I first thought about Ghazaala. I was thinking of her for months without writing a word. Then I wrote a few scenes that I did not like and deleted them. At that point, Asiya came along and I started again, writing about them both. You might say that the characters were born—and reborn—in the writing and rewriting of the novel. Or perhaps they have been expected to carry it? We are, differently, experiencing the strengths of women, through and beyond grief, in all of the novels. Perhaps one important point is that it does not get easier — there is a perception that it is easier for the younger generation. But sometimes the illusion of modern freedom does not translate into an ease of agency or actual freedom. I think a lot about Maliha inSilken Gazelles— she’s only a few years older than Ghazaala but seems to have less freedom of movement, or self-expression. I do not see myself, nor any writer, as a definitive spokesperson for Omani society.

Growing up I always wondered why we commemorate historical events on a yearly basis, like Independence Day or Gandhi’s birthday. While formal education failed to develop that understanding, reading gave me a perspective on the power history and why we need to keep learning from the past to avoid repeating mistakes of the past. In his latest book,WhoisEqual?, senior advocate and queer rights activist Saurabh Kirpal has tried to do the same by drawing inspiration from history on how we fared on the ideals of equality and why it remains a quest worth fighting for. Edited excerpts from an interview. Certainly, talking about equality would become irrelevant when there will be no inequality. Only a person completely removed from the reality of India would say that there is no inequality. Forms have changed, the ways you discriminate have changed, but sadly the axes around which inequality exists has been persistently stubborn, which I talk about in my book in terms of religion, caste and gender. They’re the same grounds on which discrimination happened in 1947 as it does now. I think privilege gives you a cushion not to be able to see discrimination on a daily basis. The removal of the tag of criminality under Section 377 only happened in 2018, not when we became independent. Equally, when the Constitution declares that everyone is equal under Article 14 or in certain directive principles, it’s delusional to think that these magic words will lead to equality descending upon the polity as a whole. Not understanding the structural imbalances that persist go beyond mere words or constitutional promises. Inequality is a reflection of structural problems that exist in society and as long as they don’t disappear inequality will not. From the perspective of a queer person, while Section 377 is gone, there is marriage inequality, and on a daily basis, people are petrified of coming out at work, because of fear of harassment or wrongful termination.

When we say state capacity we broadly mean the capacity of the state to successfully achieve tasks and goals assigned to it through the political process. We have a lot of discussions in India about policy priorities. Like should the government focus on infrastructure or health or education? We want it to do everything, but what we don’t ask is how will the government actually do it? Does it have the capacity to do it? And why is the translation of budget into outcomes so weak? India has a lot to be proud of as the world’s fastest-growing large economy, with macroeconomic stability. But there are also deep challenges and weaknesses, including issues in education, health, or child development, police, courts, welfare, jobs etc. What I argue is that the biggest obstacle to meeting these challenges is the effectiveness of the government machinery itself.

A Bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi was hearing a plea by four life convicts from the Scheduled Tribes (ST) and Other Backward Classes (OBC). They had complained that the Jharkhand High Court had not pronounced its verdicts on their criminal appeals even after reserving the cases for judgment two to three years ago. There are no specific timelines within which judges have to deliver judgments. The convention is that the judiciary ought to pronounce judgments within a reasonable time, from two to six months, of reserving cases. However, judges, including in the Supreme Court and the High Courts, have in practice reserved judgments for well over a year before delivering them. This may be due to the complexity of the question of law involved or the burden of work. On Wednesday (November 12, 2025), Justice Kant, who is Chief Justice of India-designate, indicated that reforms and transparency in judicial functioning must not be limited to litigants alone, it should also meet the legitimate expectations of the public at large. “Let everybody know how many judgments have been reserved by any judge and how many are pronounced; within how many days the judgments are made available in the public domain; and how many days High Courts actually take to upload judgments,” Justice Kant observed. Justice Bagchi said there ought to be a dashboard on High Court websites, exclusively focussing on the reservation and pronouncement of judgments. “That will show the transparency and accountability of the judiciary to the people,” Justice Bagchi remarked.

Edited excerpts from an interview: There are two parts to it; the first is obviously the title of the book. I think it becomes important to turn that mockery on its head and perhaps reclaim the word and call ourselves the ‘urban elite’. Assuming for a minute that queerness is only limited to the urban elite, does that mean that the Constitution does not work for us? The answer is no. But if you look at the petitioners — and Chief Justice D. Y. Chandrachud’s judgment traces the backgrounds of each of the petitioners —  you will see that a wide range of people were a part of it, from people from marginalised castes to Catholics. The whole process of using this urban elite definition was to kind of disenfranchise the queer community. One would expect that arguments, especially when advanced before the Supreme Court, would be based squarely on legal points, but we’ve seen ad hominem attacks on the petitioners across the board in human rights litigation, on the lawyers for the petitioners and also on the motivation behind the demands of petitioners.

Stalin, without explicitly naming them, and accused the ruling party of resorting to spreading slander against his party. In a post on X, Mr. Vijay said, “In recent times, a political party that is on the verge of being rejected by the people has resorted to the politics of spreading slander. Do you know which party I am referring to? Is it necessary to say its name when it is the only political party that has made defaming others as its core political principle? Their only goal these days is to criticise the TVK.” Mr. Vijay said the ruling party was making baseless allegations against the TVK, though his party had not yet begun a full-fledged critique of the DMK’s politics. According to him, his party’s criticism of the DMK had been mild and expressed with civility. “To deceive the people by projecting themselves as ideologically committed, the leader of the party has declared Tamil language, Tamil Nadu, and Tamil identity as their core principles. When they are out of power, they talk about the Tamil language and Tamils, but after coming to office, they comfortably settle into positions of power and blame constitutional constraints while enjoying its privileges.

1775,2025,The Hindu,1775,"Renegotiation of the Indus Waters Treaty looks inevitable; an opportunity to address environmental issues: Daniel HainesPremium Sharing river waters across political geographies, be it within a sovereign country or between two or more nations, is always contentious. Matters become more complicated when rivers run across countries weighed down by discord. The Indus, which nested a historic civilisation; from which the world’s largest democracy; a subcontinent; and, indeed, the third largest ocean; get their names, is among the world’s longest rivers and runs across India and Pakistan, both birthed out of British India in 1947. The Indus basin, with a drainage area of about 1,165,000 sq km, according to the Encyclopaedia Brittanica, was developed into a vast network of irrigated canals during British India, when the river system was within one political unit. The partition of India also meant that its waters were to be shared. After initial difficulties, the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) – a tripartite agreement between the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD, World Bank), India and Pakistan – insulated the Indus from political bickering and, more specifically, episodes of warfare. However, on April 23, a day after the Pahalgam attack, India put the IWT in abeyance.

Yet, this overwhelming majority gets invisibilised in corporate-backed newsrooms and popular culture. When award-winning journalist Neha Dixit started tracking the lives of a few such female workers a decade ago, operating not far from her Delhi home, she was “astonished to see” that her items of everyday use were being manufactured by home-based workers who got a pittance and could be replaced if they reached their workplace a few minutes late. In her new book,The Many Lives of Syeda X, Dixit chronicles the lives of home-based female workers while focussing on Syeda, a Muslim woman who makes everything from namkeen to photo frames to door hangings to cycle brake wires to plastic toy guns, wedding cards, rakhis and faux leather balls, even while a changing India upturns her life routinely. In an interview, Dixit says such stories “are everywhere around us, but not in the media because the media has structurally stopped talking about the urban poor in the country.” Women begin work at sunrise at a brick kiln near Visakhapatnam.

For instance, Dalits celebrate the 1818 Battle of Bhima Koregaon as they believe the British Indian Army’s victory over the Peshwa liberated them from his oppressive Brahminical rule. Mahar soldiers played a significant role in the battle. But this belief is a myth, it is argued, for the British fought the Peshwa to expand their empire, not to liberate the Dalits. Now, consider this: in 1786, the Peshwa rejected the demand of Konkan’s Mahars that Brahmin priests should conduct their marriages. Their quest for equality was suppressed.  Wouldn’t they have been relieved, if not delighted, at the demise of the Peshwa rule 32 years later? In Kurosawa’sRashomon, eyewitnesses to a murder provide remarkably different accounts of it. This is as true of the accounts of four police officers and two Dalits I used to reconstruct the January 1, 2018, violence at Bhima Koregaon.

Besides what has come to be known as the Vietnam War, it had to fight a series of wars in order to achieve its aim of being independent and united, finally gaining reunification in 1975. In a conversation, Nayan Chanda, former editor of theFar Eastern Economic Review, explains why Vietnam is a key player in South East Asia. Edited excerpts. What is the most striking feature about Vietnam and her people? What is most striking about Vietnam is the patriotism of the people who are determined to be independent. That pursuit of independence might seem abstract because they have been living under Chinese rule, French rule, and Japanese rule, but they want to live on their own terms. There is a famous song that Vietnamese rebels sang while marching against Chinese rule: “we fight to keep our hair long, we fight to keep our teeth black, the heroic southern country is its own master.” They have a traditional practice of lacquering teeth, keeping their hair long, and are saying, “We are not going to accept the practice imposed by China.” When Ho Chi Minh appealed to the Vietnamese that they would have to fight to unify the country to win independence from the French, he was speaking to very willing souls. The people understood what he was saying. In some ways, he was like Gandhi — he came from a rather middle aristocrat family, spoke Chinese, and he could have been a sort of junior Mandarin, but he wanted to win independence. And he thought winning independence is to fight the French and learn about the enemy, what the enemy’s strength is. Like Gandhi, he travelled throughout the world with his mission to win independence. People understood that he is a leader who has no other ambition than to win the war.

Yes, it is true that both sides have signalled an intention to move forward. We have certainly taken some initial steps, which are important but probably more symbolic than substantive, to bring about a thaw like resuming airlinks, Kailash-Manasarovar yatra, liberalising the visa regime, etc. However, we still need to address larger issues like trade imbalance, market access to Indian goods and services, de-escalation and early harvest issues on the border, construction of their largest dam on their side of the Brahmaputra near the Indian border, etc. Moreover, the Chinese have become active again in our neighbourhood. For example, their critical support to Pakistan duringOperation Sindoorand their attempt to encircle India through our neighbours either physically or through groupings are all manifestations of this. In addition, we now have to deal with China both a neighbour as well as the No.2 power. For the first time, we have a superpower sharing a border with us.

I vividly remember the Theyyam performances I have watched as I was growing up. I hail from a matrilineal family, Kamballoore Kottayil, in Kerala, which has patronised Theyyam for over three centuries, including a Muslim Theyyam and a mosque. The origin of Pottan Theyyam is also said to be from the estate of the K.K. family, consequent to an argument between Adi Shankara and the oppressed Pottan who questioned untouchability and discrimination based on caste, taking on Brahminical theories of ‘Chaturvarnyam’. I have constantly interacted with performers at various levels throughout my growing years. These have played a role in my penning this comprehensive book on Theyyam. As Balan Nambiar, who has written the Foreword to the book, says, “Theyyam, being a total art form, the research has to be accomplished from various angles of anthropology, history, language, theatrical/chorographical aspects, rituals, folklore, performance art and plastic arts.” I have tried looking at Theyyam in all these angles. ‘Devakoothu, the sole Theyyam performed by a woman.’

1789,2024,The Hindu,1789,"‘My money is where my mouth is,’ says Ruchir Sharma, author of What Went Wrong With Capitalism Ruchir Sharma grew up in Delhi wondering what is wrong with socialism, but now he is grappling with what is wrong with capitalism. In his new book,What Went Wrong With Capitalism, he has a view, albeit not from the ringside, on how capitalism works, and when it does not. As a Wall Street investor for decades, he is part of the cast and is at centrestage. Sharma traverses the two worlds of the U.S. and India, and democracy and capitalism. Strange as it might sound, Sharma writes that he is in agreement with a lot of what American Senator Bernie Sanders, who calls himself a socialist, says is wrong with capitalism. In fact, he is in agreement with many critics of capitalism, but disconnects with most of them on how to resolve its crisis. He does not push for more state intervention as is usually argued, but points out that its own restoration will save capitalism. Sharma detests socialism as much as he does sugar because he thinks both blight human capacity. Democracy and capitalism are “soulmates,” he says. His father was a navy officer, causing a young Sharma, born in Tamil Nadu, to move across India, and then to Singapore, which turned out to be a moment of discovery for him. Singapore’s rise, Sharma concluded, came from the economic freedom it accorded to its citizens, despite the political restrictions. He developed a keen interest in reading, particularly on political and economic models, and philosophy. It was also the time the Soviet experiment was ending, and India was in liberalising mode. In 1992, by the time he was finishing school in New Delhi, Sharma had figured out enough about the world of finance to start writing a column for a business daily. He continues writing op-eds and books till date. “Capitalism is about giving people as much economic freedom as possible and socialism seems very oppressive.

Edited excerpts from an interview. More than Twitter, that’s a silly space, it was academia. The way the academy is designed is through argument and debate. When someone does their PhD, we say ‘defend your thesis’, it’s very combative. The academy comes from the idea that there is one truth — this works in science because, at the end of the day, you have to get mathematical, objective evidence. In the realm of history, to a large degree, you can get it, but when it comes to more subjective things like art, mythology, ideas, it becomes extremely difficult to figure out what’s going on. I say: don’t argue, listen. Try to figure out different ways in which we can understand the same thing.

1791,2025,The Hindu,1791,"Early immune changes hint at ways to prevent rheumatoid arthritisPremium For millions worldwide, waking up with stiff, aching fingers that take hours to loosen is a daily battle — one waged by their own immune system. This is rheumatoid arthritis, a condition where the body’s defences mistakenly attack the joints they’re meant to protect. Currently affecting about 18 million people worldwide, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study projected an alarming 80%risein rheumatoid arthritis cases over the next 30 years. Rheumatoid arthritis often strikes between ages 30 and 60, and women are thrice more likely to develop it than men. Scientists still don’t know exactly why but genetics, hormones, and environmental triggers like smoking or certain infections all appear to play a role. While modern therapies have considerably improved patients’ quality of life, most patients are diagnosed only after the immune disruption has reached an advanced stage. The condition can affect the joints as well as lungs, the heart, eyes, skin, and many other organs. Chronic inflammation increases the risk of heart disease and causes fatigue, fever, and depression. A newstudyinScience Translational Medicine, in which researchers mapped the hidden preclinical evolution of rheumatoid arthritis at the molecular level, could lead to the next leap in patient outcomes. The study has revealed that the immune cells are primed to become troublesome years before the first symptoms appear. In future, therefore, clinicians could potentially intervene early before joints are damaged. One of the earliest warning signs of RA is the presence of anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs). These antibodies can appear in blood tests three to five years before the first clinical signs of arthritis. People who test positive for these antibodies but have no symptoms are labelled “at-risk individuals”, a definition adopted by clinical trials such asAPIPPRA.

To readThe Golden Road: How Ancient India Transformed the Worldis like opening a magic box — packed with strange and absorbing characters, quirky and almost-forgotten narratives, startling and uncommon facts.

In fact, a small part of the 90-page monograph talks about “the demonisation of Muslim men” being an “important aspect of the Hindutva project”, as she explains in this interview.

1795,2025,The Hindu,1795,"The ‘game-changer’ in the Bihar election 2025Premium A resounding political victory often poses the question whether there was a game-changer. To argue that the victory resulted from a fortuitous combination of many factors appears less attractive. Analysts are tempted to search for game-changers so that a dramatic-looking outcome can be explained by equally dramatic looking new formulation. The victors, on their part, need the big story because such a story feeds into a narrative that can help them beyond the immediate terrain of the electoral victory. In the recently held Assembly election in Bihar, which resulted in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) winning nearly half the votes polled and bagging nearly 90% of the seats in the Assembly, this State election appears to be a case where some key factors must have produced this scale of victory. With the Opposition taking exception to the last-minute scheme for the benefit of women which had been devised by the State government and cash transfers taking place right around the time when the actual campaigns kicked off, the women’s vote stands out as the key factor that gave the NDA its massive victory. The fact that women outnumbered men in terms of voter turnout, has added more plausibility to this argument. Another factor, according to at least some circles, is the young voter. Their overwhelming support, it is asserted, helped the NDA register this dramatic victory. Indeed, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) too did promise a government job for every household but many believe that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s pitch for one crore government jobs was what stole the day. 2025 Bihar Assembly election results Along with the promise of one crore lakhpati didis (women with an income of ₹1 lakh per annum), this slogan must have resonated among voters.

1796,2025,The Hindu,1796,"The ‘impartiality’ of a nominated GovernorPremium The Supreme Court of India judgment on the role of Governors and the subsequent advisory given by the Supreme Court Constitutional Bench on the 16th Presidential reference have sparked a debate on the letter and spirit of the Constitution. The words that found a place in the final draft adopted by the Constituent Assembly reflected the spirit of the debates that the august House had witnessed. Incidentally, it was on November 26, 1949, that the Constitution was adopted. The debate on the role of Governors in the Assembly was one of quality and substance. Many questions were raised about the office, the role and the powers of a Governor in an independent India. At every turn, Babasaheb Dr. B.R. Ambedkar intervened and clarified the carefully thought-out ideas that had gone into the draft. Doubts were expressed by members about the impartiality of a nominated Governor. They argued that as a nominee of the central government, and not elected by the people, he would be ‘remote-controlled’ and ‘no different from the old provincial governors under the Government of India Act, 1935’. They wanted the office-holder to be above suspicion and feared that they might become a “replica of the Viceroy’s nominees”. Replying to these apprehensions raised by the members in 1947, and later in 1949, before the adoption of the Constitution, Dr. Ambedkar said, “Some members have expressed fear that a nominated Governor will be a nominee of the Centre and not of the Province. I have no doubt that the Governor is required to act on the advice of his Ministers. He is not intended to be an agent of the Centre.” And further, “It must be emphatically stated that the Governor under the Constitution is a purely constitutional Governor. He is there to make the parliamentary system work, not to rival the elected Ministry.” The next major debate that took place was on the discretionary powers of the Governor.

The Supreme Court of India has given its opinion on 11 out of the 14 questions on which the President of India had sought its advice under Article 143 of the Constitution. The issue behind these questions is the role to be played by the Governor of a State while deciding on the Bills passed by the legislative Assemblies as in the provisions of Article 200 of the Constitution.  The mode of appointment and exercise of discretionary powers by the Governor have engaged the attention of the political executive, at the Union and State levels, and constitutional experts. After seven-and-a-half decades, it is time to analyse how the discharge of gubernatorial responsibilities has given rise to conflicts and litigation. The two major constitutional questions which came up before the Court in the Tamil Nadu case and the subsequentPresidential referencewere, first, the existence of discretionary power for the Governor while assenting to, withholding assent from and in reserving a Bill for the consideration of the President, and, second, the time limit within which a Governor or the President has to act on a Bill passed by the legislature. In the Court’s opinion, the Governor has discretion in the three courses of action available when a Bill is presented and no time-line can be prescribed.

According to the National Judicial Data Grid, there are 4.69 crore cases pending in district courts. Another Bench of the Court has asked judges in Delhi to undergo training due to a lack of basic knowledge. There are a few options to make changes in the administration of justice. The Code of Civil Procedure and the Civil Rules of Practice contemplate procedures to be followed by courts in entertaining proceedings, issuing summons to the defendants, and for the appearance of parties. Subordinate judges handle this. They are forced to call every suit for the appearance of parties or order the issue of fresh summons and receive vakalathnamas. This takes up much time in the morning, leaving judges with very little time for the disposal of cases on merits. In most subordinate courts, the calling of cases goes on from 10.30 a.m. till well past noon. Quality time is lost by attending to such clerical and ministerial work. A judicial officer in the lowest rank in hierarchy can be appointed in every district court to call all the cases of that particular cadre of courts (senior civil judges or civil judges or district munsifs, as the case may be). This court can do ministerial work the whole day and can also be assigned with the power to record ex parte evidence, issue of summons, receiving vakalath and written statements. At the end of the day, this court can list matters for trial and arguments the following day in each court. This list can be posted on the website in the evening. The cases can be taken up, as in this list, from 10.30 a.m. every day by each court, and these courts can dispose of matters listed till evening.

This resolution recognised the critical role of comprehensive care and support policies, aimed at reducing, redistributing and valuing unpaid care and domestic work, to the well-being of society and all its members — in particular, children, older persons and persons with disabilities — more so, as a disproportionate share of care and domestic work is undertaken by women and adolescent girls. It also remains invisible, undervalued and unaccounted for in national statistics, and neglected in economic and social policymaking. India has had a long history of care provision with institutions outside the family emerging in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the work of educationists such as Tarabai Modak and Gijubai Badheka. These pioneering efforts, with developmentally appropriate practices, gradually declined as modern childcare provisioning emerged post-Independence. With modern childcare mostly in the private, voluntary sector, low-income families, those who needed childcare services the most, were excluded. The report of the study group on the development of the preschool child, submitted to the Government of India in 1972, with Mina Swaminathan as its convenor, transformed the history of childcare services in the country.

It has served as a barrier to the spread of desertification from the Thar Desert to the Gangetic Plains, guarded Rajasthan’s proudest forts such as Chittorgarh and Ranthambore, and served as the cradle of spirituality for communities across northwest India. The Modi Government has now nearly signed a death warrant for these hills, already denuded by illegal mining. It has declared that any hills in the range with an elevation of less than 100 metres are not subject to the strictures against mining. It is an open invitation for illegal miners and mafias to finish off 90% of the range which falls below the height limit set by the Government. On the northernmost end of the Aravalli range, the national capital has embarked on its annual smog season this month. A hazy mist of dust, smoke and particulate matter has been settling down on millions of citizens as they go about their daily lives breathing in toxic air. Even as the smog becomes a part of our yearly routine, research increasingly shows that it is a full-scale, slow-motion public health tragedy. Estimates of the human toll of this pollution go as high as 34,000 deaths in just 10 cities annually. Last week the news headlines reflected yet another evolving tragedy. The Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) has reported that 13%-15% of tested groundwater samples in Delhi contain uranium beyond the permissible limit for human consumption. Shamefully, water samples from Punjab and Haryana reflect even higher levels of uranium contamination.

Deepavali prompts a fresh round of breast-beating as the spate of firecrackers adds more smoke and pollutants to the already-unbreathable air. But this is not a seasonal inconvenience; it is a chronic public health emergency. And yet, year after year, we treat it as a passing nuisance rather than a structural failure. Since 2015, I have personally convened and conducted an annual Round Table on Clean Air with different stakeholders — public health experts, environmentalists, science journalists, Members of Parliament, and even Ministers. Every year I seek different institutional partners and a wider circle of attendees in the hope of enlarging the number of those determined to do something about the air we breathe.

At this moment, ideas such as universal basic income (UBI), once dismissed as utopian, deserve a fresh, pragmatic look. A UBI can cushion mass unemployment, restoring consumer demand when machines outnumber workers, rewarding unpaid care that props up the formal economy, and rebuilding a social contract frayed by pandemics and capitalism alike. In India, where welfare systems are often plagued by inefficiencies, exclusions and complex eligibility filters, a UBI offers a radical yet simple proposition: a periodic, unconditional cash transfer to every citizen, irrespective of income or employment status. Re-examining it is no longer an academic indulgence. It is an urgent policy imperative. By embedding dignity, autonomy and simplicity into its design, a UBI challenges us to rethink what a welfare state ought to provide in the 21st century. Universality is the primary strength of a UBI. Where Bismarckian and Beveridgean models peg security to past employment or bureaucratic proof of hardship, a UBI anchors it in citizenship alone, transforming social protection into a streamlined, rights-based pipeline that is resilient to automation shocks, climate emergencies and the invisible labour of care. It bypasses the administrative complexities of targeted welfare and removes the stigma associated with poverty-based entitlements. It aims to create a basic floor of income security for all, ensuring that no one is left behind due to bureaucratic lapses or conditional access.

The SIR was conducted in Bihar earlier, beginning in June; the Assembly election has just been held in the State. The Opposition had opposed the SIR in Bihar on various grounds which included the haste with which such a massive exercise was sought to be done. The Opposition challenged it in the Court on the ground that, inter alia, the ECI’s power to conduct such an extensive revision after a summary revision done as recently as in 2024 was unconstitutional. Although the Court made some interim observations and directions to protect a voter’s right, the constitutional issues have not been settled. The ECI claimed, while justifying the SIR in Bihar, that the last SIR had been conducted in 2002-03 with demographic changes since then due to large-scale urbanisation, migration and death. Therefore, it was necessary to revise the roll comprehensively to reflect the latest demographic picture in the State. The ECI, no doubt, has the statutory right to conduct a comprehensive revision of the electoral roll.

It is a curious twist of fortunes, but all this while welfarism keeps returning centre stage. Politicians of the left and the right reach for it when inequality widens or when growth feels exclusive. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in Brazil, the Keir Starmer government in the United Kingdom, and in India, various Chief Ministers have built on welfare-led politics. Now, the Big Apple will have its “Mamdani moment”. Mr. Mamdani will begin governing only from January 1, 2026, with an all-women Transition Team, but the headline promises — free buses, rent freezes, universal childcare — pose a basic question. What does sustainable welfarism look like in economies that still rely on markets to allocate most goods and services? The appeal is obvious. Welfare acts fast. It bypasses the slow grind of productivity reforms and delivers visible outcomes: children in school, workers in transit, families housed. Yet, there is a boundary condition that voters sense and economists formalise — quality often erodes, deadweight losses creep in with welfarism, and black markets flourish when prices are pushed below cost. Free buses without cost discipline can mean fewer buses or poorly maintained fleets. Rent freezes can protect tenants yet deter new construction, with “key money” resurfacing. Free childcare can expand access but strain quality if staffing and training are not funded. Does this mean conventional economics is merely pinched lipped about compassion? Not quite. Incentives are not a moral preference; they describe behaviour. Set a price to zero, demand rises; if supply cannot scale, queues and side-payments follow. But economics also recognises distribution: policies aiding the worst-off can increase social welfare even with some inefficiency. Here, John Rawls matters — judge society by its least advantaged.

1805,2025,The Hindu,1805,"Inter-State rivalry that is fuelling India’s growthPremium Last month, whenGoogle unveiled its plansfor its largestArtificial Intelligence (AI)data centre outside of California, U.S., in Andhra Pradesh, Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu gleefully claimed bragging rights — a global tech titan choosing his State for a marquee investment over regional rivals such as Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The jubilation in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, could be heard across State borders. In Tamil Nadu, a former All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam Minister chided the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam-led Stalin government for failing to woo Google, although it is headed by a true-blue Tamil. Across another border, a Karnataka Minister suggested, with barely concealed envy, that Andhra Pradesh had lured Google with “extravagant subsidies”. Strip away the politics, though, and what you see is something profoundly healthy — competition among States for investment — a potentially powerful engine for growth. For the first time in decades, Chief Ministers are not queuing in Delhi’s corridors of power, but are in boardrooms of multinationals and corporate conclaves, persuading investors that India’s best destination is their State. To appreciate this shift, cast your mind back to pre-1991 India. For four decades after Independence, capital investment was largely a political decision made in New Delhi. The “commanding heights” of the economy were occupied by bureaucrats who dispensed patronage through licences, permits and quotas. The country’s industrial geography was determined by political calculation rather than market forces. The Centre decided what should be produced, how much should be produced, and, crucially, where it should be produced. States, on their part, vied for investment not by wooing potential investors but by wooing politicians in Delhi. Thereforms in 1991changed that. By dismantling industrial licensing and opening India to trade and investment, liberalisation shifted power — at least partly — from the Centre to the States.

1806,2025,The Hindu,1806,"The Kamalesan case and its simple lessonPremium Every democracy faces moments when two values, both legitimate and which are deeply held, collide. The case of Lieutenant Samuel Kamalesan, dismissed from the Indian Army for refusing to enter the sanctum of his regiment’s temple or gurdwara during mandatory parades, is one such clash. The Delhi High Court upheld the dismissal (Samuel Kamalesan vs Union of India), and the Supreme Court of India declined to interfere. The legal result is clear. The moral unease remains. The Court relied on military necessity, discipline and the power given by the Constitution under Article 33. The judgment places his refusal within the frame of disobedience of a lawful command rather than the practice of personal faith. Seen through that narrow lens, the courts acted exactly as they believe they should in military matters: defer to the generals. But that deference should not end the national conversation. When two legitimate values collide — conscience and cohesion — the tragedy is not simply that one side must lose. The tragedy is when institutions forget that accommodation is often possible, and often wise. Also Read |Supreme Court upholds dismissal of Christian Army officer who refused to enter inner part of regimental temple for pooja No one can dismiss what the Indian Army told the Court. A commanding officer in a fixed-class regiment must be accepted by the men he leads into war. Ritual and ceremony, though rooted in faith, serve as instruments of morale. Officers are expected to participate fully to strengthen their bond with the troops. The Indian Army saw the officer’s stance as distancing, even if he meant it respectfully. The Court accepted this view. Military ethos demands unity. And no institution in India has preserved unity more honourably than the Indian Army.

There was one survivor passenger. Nineteen persons on the ground lost their lives, making it the first crash of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner since its introduction into commercial aviation. There are over 1,175 Dreamliners flying with various airlines, operating an average of 12 hours a day. Since the crash, Dreamliners have flown more than two million hours without a single engine failure during take-off. In the history of airline operations, there have been very rare instances of a dual engine failure on take-off. The accident involving a UPS MD-11, on November 4, 2025, is one, which was due to engine separation. After this crash, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) released relevant information with daily briefings — something that never happens in India. Ever since the crash, the electronic media and social media YouTubers have been spreading far-fetched theories to create an atmosphere of fear and also question the safety standards of the Boeing 787. What is being spread is a diversion from the truth and the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA), Government of India, has played into their hands by delaying the release of the final investigation report. The promise of there being a “Transparent” report as soon as possible, which the Aviation Minister announced on the day after the crash, appears to be another statement which has been swept under the carpet — as is the norm for all the aviation accident reports in India.

Because, if the foundational principles are allowed to crumble, the remaining structure will wither away. Further, the institutions which sanction such an obliteration of core ideas, almost always meet the same end. Once the tree falls, the branches cannot survive. The Supreme Court of India has done just that, while answering the16th Presidential referenceon the powers of Governors and the President of India. The core philosophy of federalism, ingrained in India’s Constitution, lies eroded and buried. The States will gradually become shadow Union Territories with Legislatures but dependent on the dictates of those in power in the central government. Federalism is a vital safeguard in addition to being part of the basic structure of the Constitution. Sounding the death knell for federalism would precipitate the absolute dominion of the Government of India over the remaining institutions that seek to control, regulate and quash arbitrariness and the autocracy of those in power at the Centre. Under the constitutional scheme, the Union and States are equal partners, with the Government of India being only ‘first among equals’. States are not subservient to the Union Government, nor are they secondary appendages, bound by the diktats of the Government of India. In fact, in all areas in the State list (such as land laws and law and order), they enjoy complete autonomy. Any other understanding of federalism in the Indian context would disrupt and violate the constitutional scheme envisaged by the framers of the Constitution.

1809,2025,The Hindu,1809,"The letter has won but the spirit has not lostPremium The Republic of India has had 15 Presidents over 16 presidencies, its inaugural President, Dr. Rajendra Prasad having served two terms. Of the number of Governors appointed since 1947, the figure is too large to be counted. The holders of these two high offices can do great good, sometimes not a little harm and very or most often, prefer an almost Advaitic selflessness that leaves no mark whatever — a self-protecting mechanism. It is better to be not remembered at all than remembered negatively. I have often wondered why these high functionaries, when they are males as they invariably are, carry pens in the pockets of their coats. The pen is almost a piece of their essential ‘getting ready’-ness. It makes them seem ever-ready to sign the paper put up to them, wherever they are. The master cartoonist,Abu Abraham, immortalised the 1975 momentwhen the then President signed the proclamation of the national emergency by a searing cartoon that showed him signing the paper when it was brought to him (this time with the stylus) at a very odd moment. Signatures can be affixed all too easily, when what is required is saying, ‘No, very sorry, but no.’ The reason may be plain gratitude for being where the Excellency wants to be.

1810,2025,The Hindu,1810,"Donald Trump shakes up the global nuclear orderPremium Today, the global nuclear order offers a curious contradiction — since the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, nuclear weapons have not been used during the last 80 years. The global nuclear arsenals have come down from a high of 65,000 bombs in late 1970s to less than 12,500 today. And, despite concerns in the 1960s that by 1980, there may be at least two dozen states with nuclear weapons, the total today remains nine — five (the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France and China) are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council who had tested before the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) came into being while four more developed their nuclear arsenals later (Israel, Pakistan, India and North Korea). Looking back, these would seem to be impressive achievements but nobody is celebrating. In fact, the prevailing sentiment is that the global nuclear order is under strain and the recent announcements by U.S. President Donald Trump may weaken all three elements of the global nuclear order. On October 30, 2025, on his way to a meeting with China’s President Xi Jinping in Busan,Mr. Trump announced on Truth Social, “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately.” He added, “Russia is second, China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years.” While it was clear that the message was directed at Russia and China, it was unclear whether Mr. Trump was referring to ‘nuclear explosive testing’ or the testing of nuclear weapon systems. Second, the nuclear labs (Los Alamos, Lawrence Livermore, and Sandia) and the Nevada testing facilities fall under the Department of Energy and not the Department of War.

1811,2025,The Hindu,1811,"Institutionalising animal representationPremium Any meaningful conversation about the political representation of animals must begin by challenging the deep anthropocentric assumptions embedded in modern political thought. The core issue is not just cruelty but also the structural design of democracy itself, built on a rigid division between “the human” and “the animal”. This foundational split, the original political boundary, positions the animal as the non-subject as it is non-rational, non-political, and a being reduced to “mere life”. Across history, this single, simplified category of “the animal” has collapsed a vast plurality of non-human worlds into a negative mirror against which human superiority is defined. Language, reason and political agency were claimed for humans by denying these to others. This act of categorical “othering” is what enables the institutionalised exploitation of non-human beings today. The task, therefore, is to expose the artificiality of this division. Animals are not a homogeneous mass but a heterogeneous multiplicity of beings whose lives impose distinct moral and political obligations. The problem we face is not a deficit of compassion but a structural flaw; democratic institutions treat animals as property, creating an institutional vacuum where their interests are never represented, measured or defended. This legal erasure is the root of systemic violence.

1812,2025,The Hindu,1812,"Rethinking a symbol of ‘environment responsibility’Premium The global push to ease industrial norms has recently extended to one of the most visible symbols of environmental responsibility — green cover within industrial estates and individual industries. The growing trend of reducing green-cover requirements for industrial estates, units within estates, and standalone industries is often celebrated as a step toward “ease of doing business”. However, the rationale for such relaxation — frequently based on international examples where minimum plantation norms appear lower — often lacks ecological context. While these relaxations may simplify compliance and enhance land-use efficiency, they raise a critical question. Are we mistaking convenience for sustainability? While industrial development inevitably entails ecological alteration, including the clearing of vegetation and habitats, it is critical to recognise that on-site green belts cannot compensate for the broader ecological losses associated with land conversion. Green belts primarily provide localised benefits such as microclimate regulation, dust suppression and visual greening. But they do not restore forest functions, biodiversity or ecosystem resilience. Their role remains mitigative, not restorative. Empirical evidence from multiple regions shows that well-designed green belts can reduce total suspended particulate matter (TSP) by up to 65% and lower ambient noise levels by 10 decibels-17 decibels in industrial or roadside environments. Vegetation acts as a filtering and dispersing surface, improving air quality and reducing thermal stress. However, these gains are spatially limited and cannot replicate the complex ecological services — such as carbon sequestration, hydrological regulation, and habitat connectivity — provided by intact or semi-natural landscapes.

1813,2025,The Hindu,1813,"Flexible inflation targeting, a good balancePremium The present Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) framework in India as a mandate for monetary policy to manage inflation at 4% (+/-) 2% is ending in March 2026 and is under review. In this regard the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has brought out a well-researched discussion paper, and has several questions for which views have been sought. Here, this article addresses three questions: headline versus core (excluding food), acceptable level of inflation, and inflation band. Before responding to these questions, it is pertinent to highlight that inflation control by itself is an important objective of monetary policy. High inflation, above a tolerable level, is a regressive consumption tax that affects poorer households more disproportionately than the rich and households whose incomes are hedged. Indeed, high and volatile inflation hurts savings and misdirects investments. The issue of acceptable level of inflation came up first before the Chakravarty Committee which was of the opinion that “…the acceptable rise in prices is 4 per cent (reflecting changes in relative prices necessary to attract resources to growth sectors)….” The reasoning given is somewhat opaque. The RBI has been focusing on inflation management all along, and more explicitly since the dismantling of automatic monetisation in 1994 that gave functional autonomy to the RBI in conducting monetary policy. In 2016, India adopted the FIT framework that also gave, in a broad sense, institutional autonomy. Since 2016, India’s inflation is range-bound, by and large, despite facing multiple shocks. This is an achievement for a framework that is still evolving. An issue that keeps recurring is the issue of what to target — headline or core inflation. If the overall objective of inflation control is to promote savings and investments and to protect the poor from shocks, then headline inflation should be the appropriate target.

The withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement, yet again, has tested the credibility of global processes. Yet no single actor, however powerful, can halt collective action. Others must and are stepping forward. Small island-states, emerging economies and coalitions of the willing have taken the lead. Increasingly, this mantle is passing to South Asia, home to nearly two billion people facing an extraordinary diversity of climate risks. Inaction is not an option. There have been wide consultations (as COP30 Special Envoy for South Asia) with government and civil society representatives across Bhutan, Nepal, the Maldives, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.

In this case — as in many States — the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation (TNCSC), which procures paddy on behalf of the Food Corporation of India (FCI), found itself in a spot because of time overruns and charges of corruption. One of the reasons cited is the rise in the coverage of the crop during the season, by about two lakh acres, which was known as early as mid-August. This is because farmers feel it is a safe bet to grow paddy rather than other crops due to minimum assured returns. The glut is not restricted to Tamil Nadu. Going by the data of the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, the procurement of paddy (in terms of rice) all over the country was nearly 119.86 lakh tonnes as on October 31, 2025 compared to 82.08 lakh tonnes on the corresponding day last year. In the last three years, with regard to rice and wheat, the quarterly opening stock position, as on October 1, was consistently higher than what is prescribed under the norms for the central pool. In the case of rice, the quantity is at least two times more than the requirement. In October this year, the stock was 356.1 lakh tonnes against the norm of 102.5 lakh tonnes. Compared to wheat, rice is still abundant, if one goes by the Union government’s data for the last three years on procurement and offtake under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) and other schemes. Between April 2022 and March 2025, the procurement of rice at the all-India level hovered around 525 lakh tonnes-547 lakh tonnes every year, whereas annual offtake under the Public Distribution System (PDS) was in the range of 392 lakh tonnes- 427 lakh tonnes.

It predates the establishment of post-Second World War global architectures such as the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Bretton Woods Institutions. It was conceived as a secret “oil-for-security” strategic partnership signed on Valentine’s Day 1945 between U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and King Abdul Aziz bin Abdul Rehman al-Saud on the USS Quincy in the Suez Canal Area. Originally intended to last 60 years, it was renewed in 2005. Thanks to the exceptional amity between U.S. President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MbS), this arrangement is currently being reset to the new domains of strategic cooperation, with the potential to anchor bilateral, regional and global developments in a more consequential manner. During the past 80 years, U.S.-Saudi ties have not always had smooth sailing. First, thanks to shale technology, the U.S. has become the world’s largest producer of crude and a significant exporter. While this has reduced the commercial content of the relationship, the U.S.’s exports have remained steady, leading to a decline in the bilateral merchandise trade and a balance swinging in America’s favour.

While the State invokes women’s protection and social order, criminalising polygamy raises clear tensions with Muslim personal law, which still permits limited polygamy under the Shariat Act, 1937. A State law overriding a protected personal law regime will almost certainly invite judicial scrutiny under Articles 14, 15, 21 and 25. Moreover, carving out exemptions for Scheduled Tribes and Sixth Schedule areas weakens the Bill’s claim to universality and exposes it to an Article 14 challenge on reasonable classification.

The public is left with filmy dialogues wrapped as policy, while the required democratic processes, critical debate, and transparency are largely absent. In reality, India’s approach of creating diplomatic dialogues and catchy narratives is rapidly being outpaced by the strategic evolution of its neighbours. The cyclical pattern in India’s discourse is troubling: every time an incident occurs, promises are renewed with great zeal and, equally, quickly fade away. The headlines are replaced by routine denial or new slogans, with little to show by way of stable, institutional security architecture. Our public narrative seems to oscillate between reassurance and outrage, with a lack of substantive follow-through.

The government’s clarification that its use is voluntary has not put concerns to rest. The freedom to activate, deactivate and delete the app seems to have been announced as an afterthought in the wake of public furore over the retrograde move. Why it is not left to mobile users to install or not install the app raises suspicions. It is significant that the so-called cybersecurity app is state-owned. People are not quite convinced that the purpose is not to prevent digital fraud and cybercrimes and ensure digital security. As the matter pertains to a possible violation of the right to privacy enjoyed by a large section of the population and the cons outweigh the pros, the government must roll back the ill-thought-out and contentious move forthwith. G. David Milton, Maruthancode, Tamil Nadu The rollout of the app is reminiscent of the advent of Pegasus. By dint of the government’s stout denial and the lack of technical proof, Pegasus flew under the radar of public scrutiny, but the spyware is probably out there still, doing its job. Sanchar Saathi is being labelled as a visible regulatory/anti-fraud tool. But the fact is that user consent and autonomy are removed. It has privacy and surveillance risks.

It is evident that the party has squandered the gains it made in the 2024 general election, with its footprint across north India and even Maharashtra shrinking. Though the Congress continues to govern in Telangana and Karnataka, its fault lines — especially the persistent power tussle between Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Deputy Chief Minister D.K.

Yet, it should not be construed as an unqualified endorsement of the government’s overall performance. The notably high participation of women, youth, and Economically Backward Extremely Backward Class voters suggests that welfare delivery and targeted schemes shaped the outcome. But these groups also have the sharpest expectations for improvements in employment opportunities, public safety and essential services. At the same time, the Opposition’s continued reliance on narrow caste alignments limited its ability to present a convincing developmental alternative, thereby constraining the quality of electoral choice available to citizens. This verdict is less an ideological victory and more a pragmatic selection by voters for whoever appears better positioned to deliver immediate gains.

Polygamy, by all credible accounts, is a statistically marginal practice. To elevate it into a legislative centrepiece is to mistake symbolic combat for governance. Its significance lies instead in its political grammar. The move extends a familiar pattern of gestures calibrated to reassure the State’s most vocal right-wing constituencies: from aggressive eviction drives to the closure of madrasas and recurring alarms about demographic ‘imbalance’. These interventions share a common logic — they foreground cultural vigilance over developmental ambition and recast governance as a form of ideological custodianship. The deeper loss is one of administrative focus. By devoting scarce policy attention to identity-laden legislation, the government risks entrenching the very development stagnation it claims to remedy.

If left unchecked, this will set a dangerous precedent. The Election Commission of India must consider a rule that prohibits governments from announcing or disbursing new welfare schemes within six months of an election, so that public money does not become an electoral instrument. In an analysis of the result, the fact is that the Opposition struggled to communicate effectively. Rahul Gandhi’s “vote theft” argument never reached the less-educated electorate with clarity. Prashant Kishor, despite his analytical strengths, must recognise that Indian voters trust a politician’s conviction more than a political scientist’s models. The Rashtriya Janata Dal, too, revealed internal disarray. Amid this, Chirag Paswan’s instinctive grasp of Bihar’s political pulse makes him the lifeblood of his constituency and a decisive force in the State’s electoral arithmetic. But the larger reality remains: Bihar continues to sit at the bottom of the Human Development Index even after two decades of Nitish Kumar. What Bihar needs now is politics that is anchored in long-term human development, and not last-minute giveaways or fragmented messaging. Harsh Pawaria, Rohtak, Haryana The thumping victory of the National Democratic Alliance highlights two things: Nitish Kumar is the real ‘tiger’ of Bihar and the BJP has an uncanny knack of using the ‘Modi factor’ to win elections, especially in the Hindi belt.

He talked of housing, wages, dignity — everyday concerns that unite rather than divide. His calm defiance showed that moral confidence and organisational depth can overcome the machinery of fear. For India’s Opposition, his message is unmistakable. Protest alone cannot dislodge populism. Only a credible and hopeful story about the future can. Mr. Mamdani re-framed polarising debates into collective aspirations, turning fatigue into faith. Of course, New York is not India.

The population requirement that there should be at least two million people in the metro area is only a guideline and not an absolute criterion. Given the fact that population numbers have not been updated over many decades, such objections appear politically motivated and prevent careful long-term planning for these two cities. The situation in Coimbatore, where Chennai- and Bengaluru-like traffic snarls are increasing by the day, needs a high-capacity Metro Rail as the only solution to ease congestion.

The rejection of the INDIA bloc is an unquantifiable setback, which despite its high-octane campaigns — much touted ‘vote theft’ presentations by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and a plethora of promises by Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Tejashwi Yadav — failed to resonate with the voters.

The decision of the Constitutional bench has the potential to lead to an anarchic state of affairs. If a Governor of a State indefinitely sits on Bills passed unanimously by the Legislature, there is now very little that the courts can do. The Court has said that a Governor cannot sit on Bills indefinitely, and in such circumstances, limited judicial review is permissible directing the Governor to pass orders within a reasonable time. This is precisely what the Justice J.B. Pardiwala-led Bench had done earlier by fixing a three-month period. In matters affecting democratic principles such as federalism, swift action is paramount. The Court has virtually upended the rule of law as a Governor can now, at his will, subvert the democratic will of the people expressed through the Legislature. This decision is a massive setback to the constitutional vision as the Executive can now play its own card. A fixed timeline has to be prescribed N.G.R. Prasad, Chennai The Court’s verdict was expected to settle a persistent constitutional irritant. Instead, it delivers a reprimand without a remedy. The Court affirms that Governors cannot hold Bills indefinitely, yet it pointedly avoids prescribing even a minimal timeline, leaving intact the ambiguity that has enabled Raj Bhavans to convert inaction into political leverage. The federal implications are hard to miss. It is largely non-BJP-ruled States that have borne the brunt of prolonged gubernatorial inaction, often at politically sensitive moments. When unelected authorities can slow-walk legislation without consequence, the balance of Indian federalism tilts subtly, but significantly, against States, especially those outside the ruling coalition at the Centre.

1840,2025,The Hindu,1840,"Letters to The Editor — November 26, 2025Premium Bills and timelines The judicial guideline to Governors urging them to refrain from holding on to Bills indefinitely is more in the nature of a pep talk as there is no legal binding on them to heed this advice and clear Bills as soon as they receive them. The top court has failed to analyse why this ‘phenomenon’ prevails only in States ruled by Opposition parties. It is a pity that no accountability is fixed on Governors who indulge in such unfair practices that torpedo the principles of federalism. C.V.

1841,2025,The Hindu,1841,"Lipstick, lies, and leadPremium Awoman’s body has become a site of commodification so extreme that even her most basic necessities are not spared. Products meant for hygiene or comfort razors, deodorants, tampons, shampoos are packaged, scented, and coloured in ways that signal femininity, pushing them into a hyper-aesthetic zone of the departmental store. This creates a glaring economic contradiction: men’s products, often identical in function, are sold cheaper, while women pay a premium simply for their gender. But the exploitation is not merely financial. By demanding that her essentials adhere to socially approved standards of beauty, the market sends an unambiguous message: a woman’s needs, her very body, are only legitimate when they are commodified, beautified, and consumed in accordance with society’s expectations. The Pink Tax is thus not just a matter of inflated prices — it is a subtle enforcement of control, conditioning women to invest continuously in an ideal that is neither natural nor negotiable. But this exploitation extends far beyond commercialised markets and seeps into the routines of everyday life. A tailor may charge different rates for the same blouse depending on the gender it is intended for, while a simple haircut at a salon can cost women far more than men, despite the identical service. Men’s consumption remains largely practical, functional, and unembellished, whereas women are expected to pay for aesthetic compliance at every turn. This raises the question: is the female market driven merely by trends or gullibility, or is it a reflection of deeper societal pressures — an unspoken demand that a woman’s body and appearance must conform to rigid standards of femininity in order to be socially acceptable? Is the answer in the very language and design of advertising taglines such as “You’re worth it” or “Strong is beautiful” which carry a psychological imperative, subtly instructing women to compare, conform, and continually invest in their appearance as a measure of wo",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/lipstick-lies-and-lead/article70280514.ece
1842,2025,The Hindu,1842,"Building safety netsPremium The young man consulting with me had a look of controlled anxiety. A self-check at home had shown his pulse to be faster and blood pressure to be higher than usual. It was necessary for me to find out if any stressful situation was causing the elevated numbers. He opened up and talked to me about how he had started his business from scratch and built it into a successful venture. His contented life lasted for a few years until he was duped by a partner. “Now I am back in the dumps,” he said, asking me for help with the adverse effects from the stress. He was sure about the temporariness of the situation and his ability to bounce back. “I will take a leap again and, this time, protect myself from falls,” he said. Impressed with his optimism. I wrote a short course of medicines to curb his anxiety. I reflected on the leaps of faith taken by people on different occasions. Getting married and moving out of parental care to a new family and a new place is a leap of faith, built on the fairy-tale belief of “living happily ever after”. In reality, such a fairy-tale ending is not universal. Unexpected and unpleasant circumstances test the resilience and erode the confidence of young adults. Overwhelming circumstances can be handled if there are people to confide in, loved ones who can act as safety nets. A composed mind will aid in taking stock of the situation and finding solutions. Safety nets come in many forms: caring parents, a supportive spouse, considerate friends or an inherent never-say-die attitude. Taking up a new job, shifting to a new place and starting a new venture can all be seen as leaps of faith towards becoming successful. However, during the inevitable down phases, privileged are the ones who get to hear reassuring words such as, “Don’t worry.

Yet, your academic journey is marked as “unsatisfactory”. You might even be debarred from the end-of-semester exams, all because your attendance falls below 75%. When teachers were reading outdated slides in class, you were out there doing internships and developing real-world skills. You studied the topics listed in the syllabus not by sitting in lectures, but by learning from online sources. Yet, the system does not care about what you have learned; it only cares about where you learned it from. The rule values presence over performance, quantity over quality. The 75% attendance rule was originally introduced to promote discipline and ensure regularity. The intention was noble: to encourage students to attend classes and stay engaged with the syllabus. But in practice, this rule has largely failed to achieve its goal. Students no longer attend classes to learn; they attend to mark their presence. For many, classrooms have become just another checkbox to tick rather than a space for intellectual growth. This obsession with attendance raises an uncomfortable question: has education become so uninspiring that students show up only because they are forced to? If classroom teaching merely means reading from slides, is that truly education? The reality is harsh, students scroll through reels at the backbench while professors mechanically read presentations. The process is being followed, but the purpose is lost. If students are attending college out of compulsion and not curiosity, then the system needs introspection. Shouldn’t teachers whose classes attract genuine learners, not attendance seekers, be recognised as examples of effective teaching? Students pay lakhs in fees, yet many attend not for learning but to maintain a percentage.

1844,2025,The Hindu,1844,"Freedom without securityPremium A quiet revolution has transformed India’s workforce. Every morning, millions of riders in branded jackets, drivers with phones, online tutors, and freelance designers step into a world of work. They are called partners, freelancers, independent contractors — labels that suggest autonomy and opportunity. Yet behind this language of flexibility lies a deep insecurity. The so-called gig economy, celebrated for its promise of freedom, has created a new class of workers without safety nets, benefits, or dignity. While customers relax in the comfort of their homes, scrolling for quick deals and one-hour deliveries, these workers navigate traffic and exhaustion to ensure convenience reaches every doorstep. In many ways, our collective dependence on instant service has made us complacent, even lazy — unwilling to pause and see the human effort behind our convenience. India’s digital platforms — from food delivery and cab aggregators to online education and care work — have expanded rapidly, especially after the pandemic. They represent both innovation and inequality. The platforms connect millions of workers to customers instantly, but they also disconnect them from the traditional protections of labour law. A driver or delivery agent may appear to be his own boss, yet his earnings, ratings, and visibility are controlled by an algorithm. What looks like freedom is often a façade — an invisible chain of surveillance, incentives, and penalties that turn independence into a new form of dependence. The appeal of gig work lies in its flexibility. For many young Indians, especially those without formal education or stable employment, platform work offers an entry into the economy without gatekeeping. It provides short-term income and dignity of work. But that dignity is fragile. Gig workers typically lack social security, health insurance, pension, paid leave, or grievance redress mechanisms.

1845,2025,The Hindu,1845,"The crisis within academiaPremium There was a time when teaching was a calling. Classrooms were spaces of dialogue, not deadlines; teachers were mentors, not data points. But somewhere between institutional audits and student feedback forms, the pulse of academia has weakened. Across universities and colleges, teachers are now expected to wear many hats: researcher, administrator, counsellor, public speaker, and much more. The classroom, once the core of intellectual life, has been reduced to a performative space where participation is judged by attendance, and creativity by compliance. Teaching no longer focuses on deep conversations or the slow development of ideas; instead, it’s about completing the syllabus and submitting forms. The irony is that while the system demands excellence, it offers exhaustion. Contractual appointments have become the norm, leaving thousands of qualified educators living from one semester to the next, uncertain if their services will be renewed. Full-time teachers fare only slightly better Students, too, are quietly changing. Many come to class distracted, fatigued by screens and shaped by an attention economy that rewards speed over reflection. Teachers are asked to “adapt”, which often translates to entertaining rather than educating. The expectation is that we must package knowledge attractively, like a product, and deliver it efficiently, without the discomfort of intellectual struggle. But learning, by nature, is meant to be slow, sometimes difficult, and almost always uncertain. When we deny that truth, education loses its meaning. There is also a growing moral fatigue among teachers. The profession that once promised dignity now demands constant justification. Every decision, including a grade, a remark, a missed call, is scrutinised. Academic autonomy, once a cornerstone of higher education, is increasingly fragile.

1846,2025,The Hindu,1846,"Love for the starsPremium In an age when our attention is increasingly drawn toward screens and social media, the night sky still holds a timeless, universal appeal — a quiet invitation to wonder. Astronomy, one of the oldest sciences, has inspired poets, philosophers, and physicists alike. Yet, in many schools today, it remains on the periphery of the curriculum, treated as an optional topic rather than a vital field of learning. Encouraging interest in astronomy among school-going children is not just about teaching them to identify stars or constellations; it is about nurturing curiosity, imagination, and a deeper understanding of our place in the universe. To begin with, astronomy uniquely combines wonder with scientific inquiry. When children gaze at the moon or watch a solar eclipse, they are not merely observing natural phenomena — they are engaging with questions about existence, creation, and the nature of reality itself. Astronomy invites young learners to think beyond the boundaries of earth, to question how things work in space, and to seek answers through observation, experimentation, and reasoning. This curiosity-driven learning is the foundation of scientific temperament, something every society needs to cultivate from an early age. Moreover, astronomy is a powerful gateway to interdisciplinary learning. It connects physics, mathematics, chemistry, computer science, and even history and literature. For example, understanding how stars form involves physics and chemistry; calculating planetary distances uses mathematics; exploring space missions requires computer programming; and studying the history of astronomy brings in art and culture. When students study astronomy, they begin to see how knowledge is interconnected rather than compartmentalised — a realisation that makes learning richer and more meaningful. Astronomy also teaches humility and perspective.

1847,2025,The Hindu,1847,"Watch out for ‘digital dementia’Premium A monk sits quietly beneath a tree, eyes closed and mind calm. In silence, he finds clarity. Now imagine bringing that same mindset to our use of artificial intelligence (AI). Could ancient wisdom guide us in navigating the digital age, where machines increasingly shape our memory, thinking, and creativity? AI today can process data faster than any human, filter out distractions, and make our lives more efficient. Yet, there is a risk. Just as the Tin Woodman of old stories lost his humanity piece by piece as he turned into metal, we too risk weakening our memory and problem-solving abilities if we lean on AI for everything. Researchers call this “digital dementia” — the gradual fading of neural connections when we stop exercising our brains. Monks remind us that awareness and discipline are the solutions. Silence is not just the absence of sound. It is the presence of deep listening and clarity. In the same way, using AI wisely means staying conscious rather than blindly dependent. The middle path is balance: not avoiding AI out of fear and not surrendering to it with complete trust. Instead, we must use it as a tool while keeping creativity, memory, and empathy at the centre. The science is clear. When we challenge our brains — by recalling a phone number, solving a puzzle without Google searches, or writing without auto-complete, we strengthen the neural connections that make us uniquely human. At the same time, AI can serve as a partner, taking over repetitive tasks and giving us more space for imagination. The real danger is not AI itself but the possibility of forgetting who we are when we stop thinking for ourselves. The most powerful computer in the world is still the human brain, but it remains so only if we keep it active and sharp.

1848,2025,The Hindu,1848,"Rewinding to a popular audio formatPremium Did you know that October 13 to 19 is celebrated as World Cassette Week? The celebration, organised by the online store Tape Head City in the U.S., features exclusive tape releases. Most online streaming services provide compressed audio, typically ranging from 64 kbps to 320 kbps, with many platforms defaulting to 96 kbps or 128 kbps. In other words, streaming often discards subtle sonic details. In contrast, cassette tapes were recorded on reels which provides analogue sound. Though cassettes may seem inferior owing to tape hiss, Dolby NR, a noise reduction technology, significantly reduces this, and a listener may not notice hiss at all when the tape head is clean and the volume is high. Cassettes are known for delivering rich, warm, and deep audio. In the 1990s, cassette stereos were marketed as Hi-Fi systems, as high-end cassette decks were capable of excellent fidelity. Scientific measurement may reveal wow and flutter, but these imperfections are rarely noticeable to the average listener. Instead, cassettes offer a smooth, continuous listening experience, similar to continuous motion in film. There is also no risk of auto-skipping, which is a common issue with scratched CDs. Many cassettes produced in the 2000s were mastered from compact discs, providing the benefits of digital recording. Additionally, while albums on streaming platforms can be removed when rights expire or popularity declines, cassettes protect music from third-party control once they are in the user’s possession. The user alone is responsible for maintaining them. Cassettes also offer a stronger emotional experience, evoking nostalgia for older generations and retro fascination for the youth. The designs of cassette players were often far more creative than those of their successors. There were robot-shaped cassette players, Coca-Cola can-shaped portables, and even football-shaped players.

I remember our childhood, when my brother and I laughed until we were wheezy and then got a whack on the back from our mother, to help us get our breath back. The reason for the wild laughter would be a silly thing — a mispronounced word like “a but of bitter” instead of “a bit of butter”. Nothing was too serious to laugh about, from our father’s pronunciation of English and Hindi words such as paper, nation, and bewakoof, as he always pronounced the ‘a’ (or in the Hindi word the ‘e’) as in ham, or a quarrel with a school-bus mate, as my brother kept saying “Yes, you’re right!” to all the rather unkind words of the girl until she burst into tears. Everyone laughed. Children can be cruel while at the same time find comfort in laughter as we did when an older girl was being toxic. Laughter is usually spontaneous, and bubbles up sometimes even when the situation does not call for it. I remember a time when I was in the 10th day ceremony of my grandmother, and almost lost control. The lady sitting in front of me had dyed her hair and in the sweltering heat, the black dye was running all over the back of her beige-coloured blouse in the shape of a monkey. My laughter welled up and my mother shook her head in warning. Later, I read about how during times of grief or sadness, one gets the urge to laugh wildly at any small thing, and that it is a coping mechanism. There are times when we are thoughtless in our laughter. Once when we schoolgirls were talking of a particularly haughty classmate, she appeared proudly in high heels and took a tumble. We burst into laughter, without even realising that she had been hurt. Luckily, it was a sprain which healed in a couple of weeks. Then there is the laughter that helps in a sensitive situation.

1850,2025,The Hindu,1850,"Students’ revengePremium I once resided in the staff quarters of a college with my wife and two school-going sons. My neighbours were college teachers and administrative staff. The college followed the semester system. A subject carried 100 marks, half of them for internal assessment and half allocated to the semester-end examination. The internal examination consisted of written quizzes and a test, and the subject teacher would mark them. The students’ command of English was poor in most cases. I was not liberal in giving marks and hoped it would make the students study my subject harder. Whenever there was an examination in English, they worked hard, literally burning the midnight oil. Those who failed one or two subjects were still promoted, with the condition that they clear the papers, along with the other subjects, in the next semester. “ATKT” (Allowed to Keep Term) grade was awarded on those subjects. The students reserved the day of Holi to take revenge on teachers they didn’t like. They would come out in groups from hostels on that day, carrying plastic buckets. They did not buy vermilion, the traditional powder with which they smeared their friends on the occasion of Holi. The teachers staying in the quarters were plastered with mud mixed with water from the taps installed for the kitchen gardens. They carried the teachers to the taps and washed off the mud at the end of the “session”. As I was subjected to this treatment on the first Holi after joining the college, I decided to stay away from the staff quarters the next year. I left the quarters with my wife and sons early in the morning to a friend’s home on my Vijay Super scooter. My young sons were reluctant to go as they enjoyed playing with their friends throughout the day.

While freedom of speech and expression is heralded as a fundamental right, the reality often reveals a stark contradiction. The so-called freedom to express is frequently shackled by invisible barriers, making the act of writing or typing a cautious exercise rather than a liberating one. This dilemma is especially poignant for freelance writers who, despite the allure of independence, often find themselves caught in complex constraints. The notion of freelancing is, more often than not, a comforting illusion. Here, I address those unbiased, thoughtful, and responsible individuals who write with a social conscience, not those driven solely by vanity or self-promotion. As conscientious writers, we are perpetually aware of the delicate boundaries — the numerousLakshman Rekhas— that must not be crossed, whether knowingly or inadvertently. The fear of overstepping these boundaries stems from the sensitivity surrounding religion and faith on one side, and on the other, the volatile realms of regional and national politics. In addition, writers risk becoming vilified in public debates about racism, casteism, feminism, misogyny, body shaming, and so on. The audience is bombarded incessantly by images and narratives — print, broadcast, and social media all report war crimes, social and cultural apathies, human suffering, and cruelty inflicted upon the defenceless. This relentless exposure evokes a deep, shared anguish. The feeling of helplessness that we feel are all testimony that humanity still lives on. For writers moved by such crises, the impulse to speak out candidly is natural. Yet with every expression comes the risk of misinterpretation or mislabelling. Neutral or context-specific commentary is too easily twisted as leftist or rightist, progressive or regressive, or at the least labelled as “intellectual arrogance” regardle",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/the-writers-predicament/article70256545.ece

You are at the airport baggage carousel watching your suitcase doing lazy circles on the conveyor belt, coming around for the third time. You are summoning the courage to pull the thing without getting dragged into the carousel yourself.

That not only reflects the overall development of the economy, but also the trickle-down effect which provides opportunity for all to enjoy the fruits of development. As John F. Kennedy famously said, a rising tide lifts all boats! Airports are crowded and noisy unlike in the past when one could see only the well-heeled strolling around. The usual air travellers then consisted of affluent businessmen and corporate executives, with an occasional senior civil servant thrown in. Contrast it with the present, one can see that a large section of the travellers comprises ordinary businessmen, families from the middle class, tourists and even migrant workers. My first experience of air travel was on my way to join the National Academy of Administration at Mussoorie after the well-earned success at the Civil Services Examination. My father smilingly paid for the flight in recognition of my efforts at cracking the exam, which was a tough nut even in those days. The cost of travel from Madras to Delhi by a Caravelle plane was about half the monthly salary I would make in the prestigious Service. Yet, the memory of that flight remains with me even after some sixty years! Watching the heavenly clouds passing below was such a thrilling experience. In fact, I felt let down when the pilot announced the landing at Palam after three hours of flight; I felt that it was too short for the money I doled out! Later, while in the government, air travel became frequent, and the work took me to several airports in India and abroad. It became routine, but nothing ever gave me the thrill that I felt during my first flight! Nevertheless, there are a few flights that I remember.

Well, I was definitely not surprised having known him for the last four decades and more! He has this habit of saving everything up for future. Whenever I confront him, he has an answer ready: “I am just going out for a walk” or  “It is just a train journey” or even “We are just flying to another continent!”. (This leaves me wondering if he is saving up his best clothes for a trip to the moon.) What exactly is this mindset of deferring any pleasure and keeping it for a future unknown to us? Can we term it a “special future occasion syndrome”? When I thought about it deeply, I realised that we are all culprits of this syndrome, some times unknown even to us! Of course, we need to save some money for contingencies that might arise one day. We may be making many sacrifices or postpone our enjoyment for the sake of making a decent life for our children. We all do yearn for a comfortable life especially in our sunset years when our bodies start slowly shutting down, so saving something is understandable. But there should be a limit to everything. If we start saving money without paying heed to our minimal comforts, surely it is miserliness and there is always a chance of our not enjoying even a bit of that money if we were to die soon! I have seen my mother keeping fancy plates and crockery to be only used for special guests. We hear about silverware that English families would keep for an occasion when royalty would visit them! Of course that special guest never arrived for most of the families. Some people save handbags or perfume or shoes for a “Big Day”.

1855,2025,The Hindu,1855,"Whispers of ink and ironPremium The typewriter, which was used widely and extensively during the early 20th century, marked a turning point in written communication and office work. These early typewriters were mechanical devices that allowed users to imprint characters onto paper using inked typebars. The most iconic among them was the Sholes and Glidden typewriter, which was introduced in 1873 and later marketed by Remington, which popularised the QWERTY keyboard layout still in use today. These machines transformed documentation process by quickening the pace of written communication and improving the legibility of text. They carved out a space for themselves in business offices, law firms, and government institutions. The crisp and uniform letters replaced the inconsistencies of handwriting. A workforce led by women typists created a new normal, giving rise to secretarial professions and changing gender dynamics in the workplace. Although these machines were bulky and entirely manual, they were highly valued for their durability and reliability. The rhythmic rattling of typebars striking paper became a familiar sound in offices, and the typewriter grew to be an icon. By the mid-20th century, nearly every office desk had a typewriter. Manual models evolved into electric versions, which further enhanced efficiency. This indispensable machine was then viewed not only as a writing tool but also considered as a symbol of discipline, organisation, and professionalism until the arrival of electronic word processors in the late 20th century. There was a time, many moons ago, when the clatter of keys striking paper echoed through quiet rooms, a sound as familiar as the ticking of a clock. The typewriter machine, with its solid frame, round keys, and carriage return bell, wasn’t just a machine; instead, it was an obedient companion to our thoughts, a silent spectator to a plethora of letters.

1856,2025,The Hindu,1856,"In defence of occasional idlingPremium It may seem illogical (and even ironical) to defend idleness. To many, the very thought of idling is horrifying. Yet, no matter what its critics may say, there’s something about idling that’s patently irresistible at times. Maybe it’s our ‘couldn’t-care-less’ attitude to the consequences of idling, or perhaps it’s the sheer pleasure of yielding to the temptation of doing absolutely nothing — and enjoying every minute of it. This is particularly so in a world driven inexorably by hectic work schedules, in a world dominated by work and little else. It’s a fact, of course, that idleness is basically rooted in indolence. To some, idling is as pleasurable as it’s detestable to others. Admittedly, it’s a morbid state of mind that, if not shaken off resolutely, can easily turn chronic and blight one’s life. It was humorist Jerome K. Jerome who once observed tongue-in-cheek, “I like work. It fascinates me. I can sit and look at it for hours.” And then, in almost the same breath, he went on to add, quite irrepressibly, “It’s impossible to enjoy idling thoroughly unless one has plenty of work to do!” It’s a perverse sentiment, echoed by another humorist Mary Wilson Little who observed jocularly, “There’s no pleasure in having nothing to do; the fun is in having lots to do and not doing it!” The dividing line between idling and relaxation or leisure is deceptive, for an inveterate idler may look as though he’s relaxing or unwinding when he’s actually doing neither. Perhaps it was this that prompted American author Burton Rascoe to lament, “What no wife of a writer can ever understand is that a writer is working even when he’s merely staring out of the window!” Idling and day-dreaming usually go hand in hand, amiably complementing each other. Yet, thanks to mental conditioning over the years, we tend to brand idling as an abominable vice to be avoided as far as possible. We seldom realise it’s indeed an effective ‘safety valve’ that enables us to counter and withstand the punis",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/in-defence-of-occasional-idling/article70312406.ece
1857,2025,The Hindu,1857,"The stories that dishes narratePremium Every kitchen has its ghosts, not the spooky kind perhaps, but the tenderly invisible ones. The mother, whose hand movements we unconsciously imitate while kneading the dough, or the gentle folds of kitchen napkins, as grandma wanted them. The stirring of the curry till it attained the texture my sister appreciated. The smell that brings back memories to the fore, if only for a moment. The sounds from the kitchen become echoes of people long gone or far away. In their absence, they often take up more space than they ever did when present. Every family recipe has a backstory. That humble, earthy cake I used to bake was nothing extravagant; it had neither icing nor exotic ingredients, just a pinch of love. Yet it was my children’s favourite. A simple delight they would choose over any fancy store-bought dessert. I had tasted better cakes elsewhere, but none could match the joy this one brought to our home. Years have passed, and the children have grown into fine young men. But they still ask for that exact cake. Each time, I diligently follow the old recipe without updates or clever twists. Our cake is not perfect, but it tells our story. In the story, a mother nourishes her children with each lovingly served slice, and there is a messy laughter in the kitchen, alongside two flour-dusted, brightly lit faces. That old recipe has become a kind of heirloom of memories and a keepsake of comfort and connection. In a tranquil and powerful way, it reminds me that love is not always loud. Often, it is just warm, soft, and slightly sweetened, like the cake fresh out of the oven. Our meals are also diaries in disguise, with each dish becoming a chapter, and every bite a bookmark. We make significant entries in the journal through the little meals we prepare. And through those, that we do not. If ingredients are the matter, then intentions, thoughts, and mood are the spirit. Food has the unique tendency to absorb our emotions and feelings. I told you about the ghosts, right?

1858,2025,The Hindu,1858,"Romancing the bookPremium Ilove books. I like to have them around, see them, dote over them, and feel proud of them. They give me comfort and companionship, even when unopened. When I got married, I stepped into my in-laws’ house with one suitcase of clothes and one big box of books. That box, with hindsight, carried more than paper — it carried memories, my ideologies, dreams, and the version of me that refused to be left behind. Many decades later, when I moved into a small furnished flat in Colaba, I felt oddly displaced. “There’s nothing of mine here,” I told my family. I was allowed to bring just one or two things of my own. Naturally, I chose two bookshelves. Once they stood against the wall, filled with my old companions, the flat began to feel like home. Am I a voracious reader? Not any longer. Gone are the days when a book would be read, argued over, and dissected with friends — sometimes leading to heated debates or laughter. Now, when I read, I don’t retain the details. What stays with me are the feelings — sadness, joy, tenderness, amusement. The content fades, but the emotion lingers. Perhaps because I now read not to know, but simply to enjoy the pleasure of good writing; not to peep into others’ lives, but to return to my own centre. And yet, my fading memory has not dimmed my passion for acquiring books. I can walk past a jewellery shop or resist a sari sale, but I cannot walk past a bookshop. The smell of paper and ink, the gentle rustle of pages — they conspire to seduce me. When there is a book sale, the greedy me surfaces. I buy in bulk — some for myself, others as gifts for children, friends, or anyone who might share the joy. Parting with my old books breaks my heart. No wonder I’m called a hoarder. Books calm me. Their very presence feels grounding. During my college days, I used to visit a bookshop every day — not to buy, but to sit on a small stool and read a few pages. The anticipation of returning the next day, of holding the same book again, was enough. When one d",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/romancing-the-book/article70256581.ece
1859,2025,The Hindu,1859,"Where hell breaks loosePremium A high-decibel panel-discussion on some TV news channels is pure entertainment for those of us who aren’t into mushy family serials. No doubt, it’s also equally, if not more, engrossing with its own set of plots, intrigues, conspiracy theories and whatnot. What’s more, there’s one added advantage in all these debates. We get to know about the past history of several leaders and political parties, often raked up by the opponents — albeit, not always in a complimentary manner. Here, we remind ourselves that we are one-up on serial watchers since we deal with actual fact, not fiction. Even as we settle down cozily before the screen, we gear ourselves to meet the same familiar faces, polite at the outset, permitting others their say without interrupting. As usual, the topic revolves around some tasteless remark or a contentious incident involving some personality that has ruffled a few feathers. Surely, in a diverse culture such as ours, there can never be a dearth of controversies and imbroglios that always carry a promise of cacophony — the louder, the merrier. Gradually, the momentum picks up as the panelists begin defending their respective bosses and indulging in hectic whataboutery, all while trying to drown out others. To our delight, it doesn’t stop with that. As the temperature peaks, so do the savage attacks and spewing of irrational spite, sometimes bordering on the personal till a reluctant moderator pulls them up when things go out of hand. Indeed, the need to maintain decorum happens only after a prolonged show of animosity that ensures high TRP ratings for the channel. Meantime, as we are immersed in the miasma of turmoil and outrage, we wonder about our reaction as ardent viewers. Somewhere, our amusement at the situation transitions into unconscious participation in the drama before us. While the roles of a hero and the villain are pre-determined in a TV serial, making our task of taking sides easier, here, we pick and choose some as our favourites and ",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/where-hell-breaks-loose/article70312440.ece
1860,2025,The Hindu,1860,"Let children leadPremium Children are often spoken of in hushed tones — fragile beings to be protected, guided, and gently ushered into adulthood. We build walls of care around them, well-meaning but often impenetrable. Yet, in our eagerness to shield, we forget a vital truth: children are not merely passengers in life’s journey; they are navigators, thinkers, and changemakers in their own right. To recognise children as agents is not to romanticise precocity, nor to abandon the scaffolding of adult support. It is to acknowledge that children possess perspectives, insights, and capacities that merit serious attention. It is to move beyond the rhetoric of “child-friendly” and embrace a world where children are not just seen, but heard and heeded. Take a moment to consider the spaces where decisions are made. In policy chambers, school boards, and community forums, children’s voices are conspicuously absent. Their lived experiences of education systems, healthcare access, urban design, and digital landscapes are rarely consulted. When they are invited, it is often as a ceremonial gesture, a token presence to tick the box of inclusivity. But what if we dared to do more? Imagine policy-making that treats children not as passive recipients but as active stakeholders. Their insights, drawn from daily encounters with systems that adults design but seldom experience firsthand, could illuminate blind spots and offer fresh solutions. A child’s view of a classroom, a playground, or a hospital corridor is not naïve — it is unfiltered, immediate, and often profoundly revealing. In education, too, the notion of agency must be more than a footnote. Student councils may exist, but how often do they wield genuine influence? Curricula are crafted without student input, teaching methods imposed without dialogue. To foster agency is to invite children into the heart of their learning — to let them question, critique, and co-create.

1861,2025,The Hindu,1861,"Used books were a blessingPremium In the 1960s and 1970s, buying new school textbooks were beyond the economic means of parents. Even sending children to school was deemed to be a burden on the parents. Unlike now, in those days, school textbooks were not supplied free to children studying in government-run schools. Private schools were unheard-of, not only in villages but even in small towns. Without exception, all students had to buy textbooks in the open market. To minimise the financial burden on parents, most of the students preferred to buy used textbooks. Less availability of new textbooks and their prices forced many to go for used textbooks preferably from their immediate seniors studying in the same school. The hunt for the “right senior” commences right after the final-year exams. Not all students keep their books in ship shape. A few who keep their books in good condition were the most sought after. After a thorough enquiry, a senior student was zeroed in. After visiting his house and verifying books, a decision to buy or not was taken. If the books were found to be in good condition, a bargain was struck. Sometimes, parents’ help and elders’ guidance were taken. Generally, used textbooks were available at half the price of the cover price. If cover papers were missing and the pages dog-eared, such books fetch less than 40% of the printed price. My entire school education has been completed with the help of used books only. Once, while purchasing them from a senior student, I faced a piquant situation. Of the six prescribed textbooks, only four were in good condition. But the seller put the condition of “all or nothing”. After much bargaining and with the help of my parents, the books were purchased. It was my first lesson on how to navigate and survive in society. To claim ownership of the used textbooks, the previous name was struck off and our names were written in bold letters. To give the books a new look, an old newspaper was used as wrap.

1862,2025,The Hindu,1862,"Rethinking AI integration in educationPremium In recent years, educational institutions across the globe have started to compete with one another in integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into their ecosystems. This race toward technological modernisation is often justified by the promise of increased productivity, efficiency, and personalisation in learning. Indeed, there is growing evidence suggesting that the integration of AI tools has yielded positive results in terms of enhanced grading systems, intelligent tutoring, adaptive assessments, and data-driven administrative decision-making. However, amid this wave of enthusiasm, the darker side of this integration rarely finds open discussion. While research abounds in glorifying the success stories of AI applications in classrooms, not many have meaningfully examined the negative consequences. When we outsource our thinking to algorithms, we risk diminishing our own capacity for reasoning, reflection, and questioning. Thinking, after all, is not a mechanical act — it is a deeply human process that involves uncertainty, struggle, and discovery. Yet, AI tools, designed to provide quick and polished answers, tend to short-circuit this intellectual process. As we grow accustomed to the convenience of machine-generated outputs, we often begin to lose our own sense of agency. What began as assistance soon turns into intellectual subservience. The sense of accomplishment that comes from creating, interpreting, or solving diminishes. Over time, this can instil a subtle sense of inferiority, as we start believing that machines are better than us at almost everything — writing, analysing, predicting, and even thinking. We begin to see ourselves not as creators but as subjects of an automated system. What follows is self-doubt, disengagement, and a loss of confidence in one’s intellectual abilities. Another alarming shift is the commodification of knowledge. Answers, once the outcome of critical thought and discussion, are now treated as readily available ‘products’.

1863,2025,The Hindu,1863,"The vanishing art of listeningPremium We live in an age where everyone wants to be heard, but very few wish to listen. Conversations today often resemble overlapping monologues, where each participant waits impatiently for their turn to speak rather than to understand. The art of listening, once considered a mark of empathy, respect, and wisdom, is slowly vanishing amid the constant noise of opinions, notifications, and self-expression. The digital age has given everyone a platform, but in doing so, it has also created an overwhelming chorus of voices. We express endlessly through tweets, posts, reels, and comments believing that communication is complete when we speak or write. But communication, at its essence, is not about expression alone; it is about connection. And connection begins not with speaking, but with listening. Listening requires patience, a virtue increasingly rare in our fast-paced lives. To truly listen means to slow down, to be present, and to give another person our undivided attention. Yet our modern habits make this almost impossible. Even when we appear attentive, our minds often race ahead, crafting responses or drifting toward the next task. We listen not to understand, but to reply. As a result, words lose their depth, and relationships lose their warmth. The consequences of this are visible everywhere. In workplaces, poor listening leads to miscommunication and conflict. In classrooms, students crave teachers who listen beyond test scores. Within families, members often speak past one another, leaving emotional gaps that no amount of talking can fill. In friendships and relationships, the absence of genuine listening breeds misunderstanding and distance. What people long for is not advice or judgment, but the feeling of being heard, the simple assurance that their words matter. Ironically, listening is one of the most powerful ways to speak. When we listen deeply, we tell the other person, “You matter enough for me to pause and understand.” It is an act of humility, a recogni",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/the-vanishing-art-of-listening/article70280419.ece

It is not the part of the city that surprises you often, and it is not entirely known for loosening up after hours. Which is why 8ish, Rachel Goenka’s newest project, feels like a small but noticeable shift in mood. It wants people to slow down, sip at their own pace, and treat the evening as something other than another appointment on the calendar. Interiors of 8ish

                                Special arrangement Rachel, known for The Sassy Spoon, House of Mandarin, Baraza and Sassy Teaspoon, describes 8ish as a place built around the “in-between moments” of the day — that time when you are not quite finished with work but not fully committed to a night out either. “We didn’t want to take ourselves too seriously,” she says, and the space reflects that intention. Set in the middle of Nariman Point, a neighbourhood that usually prioritises urgency over ease, 8ish positions itself as a bar that wants to become a habit rather than an event. The palette is calm — textured grey walls, wood, leather — giving the room a grounded feeling. The bar, in deep maroon marble edged with copper, is the visual anchor without trying to dominate the space. Lighting is warm but not dramatically dim, and the seating works for both a quick drink or a longer, more relaxed evening. The al fresco area offers an outdoor alternative, keeping the overall space accessible and unfussy. Where 8ish does push beyond the neighbourhood’s usual comfort zone is at the bar.

According to him, these oft-forgotten indigenous people who live in this naxal-affected part of India, “now have a legacy…creating luxury products in food and agriculture,” says Manoj, the co-founder of Araku Coffee The latest feather in Araku’s cap is the launch of nanolots, a limited-edition collection of rare specialty coffee, described on the brand’s Instagram page as “our rarest, purest and most valuable coffee yet…a rare expression of our craft.” At the launch event of these nanolots, which was held at the newly-opened Araku cafe on Commissariat Road, the brand’s second location in the city and the sixth in the world, Manoj explains the origin of this terroir-based coffee, grown on single plots, harvested in limited batches, and roasted in small quantities. While much of the coffee grown by the 1,00,000 farmers Naandi works with in this region scores 85 (a quality assessment score out of 100) at international cuppings, proving that “India can do excellence at scale”, some of the coffee produced was simply better than the rest. This resulted in the launch of Araku’s microlots a few years ago, coffee from “four or five parcels of land that we mixed together and sold as a limited edition.” The meticulous farming practices these farmers have adhered to have resulted in outstanding coffee

If first, we were guided by our elders on how to navigate through and understand life, then second, we are guided by signs embellished around otherwise naked roads to dynamically navigate ourselves on the ground. The latter is quieter but equally present everyday. Most of the time, our brains register just enough to comply with the road safety regulations and the road, taken for granted. Road signs have to be noticeable, readable, and immediately understood.

GPS helps a part but ultimately our real-time spatial awareness and perusal of road signs gives us the smoothest experience of travelling to ‘somewhere’ (the destinations you want to reach). I’ll tell you. Will you look for me? The extensive road sign system that we use today once began as twigs, stones, even fires! Signs signal you. A road sign sends you signals regarding the road environment. Whether you catch it or ignore, is up to you (ignorance is not bliss in this case, trust me). You can imagine scenarios of how the ancient humans must have made markings on the road to help them. It might have been to help them remember, or to not get lost when they return, or to guide another to follow the same path, and so on. As civilisations blossomed one after the other, our way of life and the environments connected to it began to change. Simple archaic paths turned into a dense network of roads. It wasn’t easy then to place stones and call it a day. We needed different signs. An old Roman milestone.

Music composer and singer Khatija Rahman’s upcoming show, The Garden of Echoes, belongs unmistakably to the latter.  At Chennai’s iconic Museum Theatre, this intimate concert will gather voices, memories, and melodies into one immersive experience. The name ‘Garden of Echoes’, came from a deeply personal moment for Khatija while  performing at her late grandmother’s birthday celebrations, held at a place called  Peace Garden. “When I say echoes, there’s going to be a lot of voices; not just of me, but  of many elements involved—there is a string quartet, a brass trio, there’s my band, and then there’s a conductor. We are a large ensemble, and I wanted that name to embody what we speak.” The Garden of Echoes is held together by its collaborators. The concert features  The Sunshine Orchestra’s String Quartet, a brass trio, the Indian Choral Ensemble directed by singer and composer Kalyani Nair and   co-directed by Karthik Manickavasakam, and Khatija’s  full band. With over two decades in the industry,  Kalyani’s sensibilities lend the performance its signature warmth and depth. “Her arrangements are so soulful. It captures the sound I have always dreamt of.” The set list spans Khatija’s musical journey which include playback hits, reimagined versions of her compositions, and select covers rearranged in ways she has never attempted before. “The idea is to connect with people. For me, I keep asking these questions—if I come to the show, will I be happy? Or is it value for money? These questions push my team and I  to give our best.” For Khatija, a little chant is what she describes as her “pre-performance ritual.” “I ask God to help me connect with the audience, because I still struggle with a fear of the stage, and I’m slowly working my way through it.” Behind the scenes, Khatija is also building something different; her own creative ecosystem.

This is an SUV with intent —larger, more refined, more technologically confident than anything the company has built before. We spent time with the Pack Three Option, the fully loaded 79 kWh version, to see how it behaves in the real world, and the short answer is this: Mahindra has delivered a deeply considered electric SUV that feels engineered for Indian families without compromising on sophistication. Visually, the XEV 9S strikes a balance between familiar Mahindra cues and an evolving, more global design language. The stance is unmistakably SUV—upright, muscular and assured—but there is also restraint in the surfaces and detailing. It feels cleaner than the brand’s earlier designs, with a more mature expression of their Heartcore philosophy. The lines are confident yet measured, the proportions are well-judged, and the overall aesthetic hints not just at the vehicle’s electric origins but possibly at the future direction of the XUV700 as well.

From the stepwells of Chand Baori, where water collects in a magnificent setting, to the immersive experience of a ‘Terminal in the Garden’ at Kempegowda International Airport T2, landscape architecture has never been only about nature. It’s about reframing the context between the built and unbuilt — earth, water, sky, light, sun, and moon — to nurture and renew relationships between humans and nature. Whether it’s about creating a jungle experience or carving out green spaces, the landscape architect’s role is vast and complex. While the previous generation was working at a time when the field was barely understood, the current generation has the charge to bring contextual relationships in completely innovative ways, beyond beautiful. Today’s landscape architects are increasingly conscious of raising awareness among urban city dwellers, who have become increasingly distant from nature, by applying the principles of biodiversity and permaculture, creating pollinator-friendly habitats, and cultivating medicinal herbs and food plants.

Bhagwat lauds the commitment of the new generation, many of whom he has taught. “A whole bunch of the current gen are passionate, focused, and calm; they are in no hurry to go anywhere, pouring their heart into it, and doing one landscape at a time.” The meaning of sustainable landscapes is rooted in practical concerns.

1872,2025,The Hindu,1872,"Explore the Akkulam Glass Bridge in Thiruvananthapuram for an adrenaline-filled, scenic experience As I stood on the glass bridge at the Akkulam Tourist Villagein Thiruvananthapuram, it felt like I was suspended  in air  with the Akkulam lake flowing 54 feet below me. While the structure boasts three 12-millimetre-thick laminated glass panels, an eerie feeling slowly crept within me as I listened to the gushing winds combined with the babbling reservoir. It is quite a climb to  the glass bridge, scaling a spiral stairwell and passing through almost all the attractions inside the Village — from play areas to 12 D theatres. The bridge, visible from the entrance, welcomes visitors from afar, with an LED-illuminated outline, which reminded me of the Led Zeppelin song title ‘Stairway to Heaven’. Further mystifying its appearance is a fog machine that occasionally goes off on both sides of the bridge creating the vibe of a hill station, making you forget that you are only 10 kilometres from Thiruvananthapuram city, where the excruciating torture of heavy traffic begins minutes after the sun sets. Here, the only signal you wait for is from the caretaker who politely asks you to take off your footwear before climbing  the bridge. Stepping onto the bridge is a daunting experience, as you try your level best not to look down. I am still confused about whether it was me or the bridge that was shaking. The bridge appeared slippery  as I carefully trod the wet floor. In order to maintain the cool in situations like these, the best strategy is to look up (or so I have been told), where I encountered the blurry outline of the city skyline, visible from the end of the bridge — as I walked through the bridge which is 50 metres long, two metres wide and can hold 20 people at a time. At the end of the structure, on one side, there is an Air Force museum shaped like an aircraft, and on the other side are trees. In the centre, a rectangular arch decorated with satin fabric and artificial flora can be found – the designated photo area for this experience.

1873,2025,The Hindu,1873,"Sonam Kapoor dons Ukhrul-based East, by Easternlight Zimik. Meet the designer behind the brand For Manipur-based designer Easternlight Zimik, the week has been a significant one. Actor Sonam Kapoor donned a kashan or traditional North-East wraparound-inspired set from his label, East for a dinner she hosted at her residence. Sharing photos of the actor in his creation, which puts craft from the Tangkhul Naga community in the spotlight, the designer called the day a ‘truly remarkable’ one. At Ukhrul in Manipur, Easternlight, a NIFT Delhi graduate, launched his brand nearly two years ago following stints of working with Indian designers including Gaurav Gupta and Manish Arora. “I am from the North-east and most of the time, we are not represented properly, and our stories are not shared. Even in fashion, this is true. For me, identity is very important and this is one of the reasons I started my brand, which champions the traditional weaving skills of the artisans here,” he says.

From his new Patrons collection, Sonam wore the Akha set comprising a wrap-style top tied at the back and worn over a black shirt, with a kashan skirt in maroon and black. Much like his four previous collections, the Patrons collection is deeply personal to Easternlight, and holds a special significance as well. “This collection is a tribute of sorts, to people who inspire me, and who have been instrumental in my journey so far,” he says.

1875,2025,The Hindu,1875,"Kaspers in Bandra is a bistro that lets Mumbai breathe a little easier There is an unspoken choreography to dining out in Mumbai. You dress with intention, you rehearse a breezy confidence for the host stand, and you pretend you are not silently Googling half the menu under the table. Even the smallest gestures — who orders, who pours, who pays — reveal tiny power shifts we rarely acknowledge. Eating out is not just about food anymore; it is about learning how to navigate a city that keeps getting faster, sharper, and louder. Kaspers, the new neighbourhood bistro tucked just off Hill Road in Bandra, feels like a gentle interruption to all of that. It is stylish without being self-important and playful without slipping into gimmickry. Inside Kaspers The Food Matters Group, the team behind The Table, Mag St., Iktara, and other Mumbai favourites, has poured a great deal of intention into this compact 1,000-square-foot space. Mosaic floors lead you in, deep maroon banquettes pull you closer, a zinc bar glints softly, anchoring the room without demanding attention. But the real personality comes from American artist Kacper Abolik, after whom the restaurant is named, who spent a month or two in Mumbai painting a sprawling cherub-filled mural across the ceiling. His playful touches appear everywhere — behind bottles, tucked into corners, almost winking at you. Crayons on every table seal the mood: this is a bistro that wants you to enjoy yourself, not posture. Chef Will Aghajanian’s menu reflects his global journey — Mugaritz in Spain, Per Se in New York, Horses in Los Angeles — but he cooks with a refreshing ease here. Kaspers is not trying to impress you with complexity; it just wants to feed you well, with a mix of comfort, craftsmanship, and personality. The Kashmiri pear salad with celery hearts and Belper Knolle was a confident start. Soft pears, peppery cheese, crisp celery — simple elements brought together with a clear hand. It is light, refreshing, and surprisingly memorable.

It is also when flying foxes, who have been roosting on the trees bordering this man-made lake, named after the man who built it in 1882 to meet the city’s water supply needs, wake up. Roundglass Sustain’s recently-released filmBatman and the Baavali, a documentary that showcases the nocturnal world of bats with bat conservationist Rohit Chakravarty, captures this stunning moment: swathes of these fruit bats flying across the park at dusk, silhouetted against the darkening skies, some even dipping down to skim the surface of the lake to hydrate themselves. “They go down to the water…make a splash with their chest…head off to the nearest tree…and drink water from the wet fur,” explains Rohit, in the film. “And all of this is happening bang in the middle of a city.” Rohit, whose work with bats often take him to remote, far-flung places, says spotting these flying foxes in the heart of the city was one of his most satisfying moments. “While I would have expected bats to be there, I didn’t go looking for them,” he says, pointing out that almost every city in India has bats, but we simply do not notice them.  “Bats are in places where you would least expect them, and there are many such places in Bengaluru.” Bats are often found in the heart of our cities

What followed was power outages and rides getting stuck due to continuously lashing rain.

But what truly makes a shoe worthy of the World Championships of Shoemaking? It is far more than its overall aesthetic — it lies in the precision of its micro-stitches, the fineness of its cuts, and, most importantly, the quality of its leather. The recently held World Championships of Shoemaking showcased exactly that. The top three shoes were selected by an international jury and unveiled at the London Super Trunk Show 2025. After travelling all over the world at acclaimed bespoke stores, the shoes have finally arrived at the Bridlen store in Chennai, where they will be held on display till December 7.

1884,2025,The Hindu,1884,"Desk-bound employees increasingly prone to frozen shoulder, say expertsPremium Frozen shoulder -- medically known as adhesive capsulitis -- affects an estimated 2–5% of the general population and is significantly more common among individuals with diabetes. Despite its prevalence, experts warn that early symptoms are often subtle and easily overlooked. Many patients assume shoulder pain requires a fall, injury or heavy exercise to be taken seriously, but specialists emphasise that this is incorrect. The condition frequently develops quietly in everyday environments, especially among desk-bound workers whose routines restrict shoulder movement for long hours. A mid-30s Chennai-based IT professional experienced this pattern in a way orthopaedic experts say is becoming increasingly  typical. His workdays -- 10 to 12 hours at a laptop, gradually led to night pain and mild difficulty lifting his arm. He ignored these early signs for nearly two months. By the time he sought medical attention, “the shoulder was already in the frozen stage,” recounts Kalaivanan Kanniyan, senior consultant orthopaedic surgeon, SIMS Hospital, Chennai. Though he eventually recovered with physiotherapy and ergonomic corrections, the process took several months. According to Dr. Kalaivanan, this underscores why unexplained shoulder pain needs timely evaluation: early intervention could have prevented progression. Experts widely note that the public often associates frozen shoulder with a major injury, but this assumption delays care. “Honestly, many people get frozen shoulder without any big trigger,” says Dr. Kalaivanan. Limited arm movement in daily life can slowly inflame and tighten the shoulder capsule. Even mild pain, if it leads to avoiding movement can accelerate stiffness. Chetan Shashikant Pophale, senior consultant, spine surgeon, Apollo Speciality Hospitals, OMR, Chennai, adds that in a large share of cases the problem starts simply because the shoulder is not taken through its full range for long periods. “Even slight posture-related strain, diabetes, thyroid ",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/desk-bound-employees-increasingly-prone-to-frozen-shoulder-say-experts/article70344359.ece
1885,2025,The Hindu,1885,"As Christmas countdown begins, here’s your ultimate guide to Advent calendars in India Intended to beguile your curiosity every single day till Christmas Eve, the 24-day Advent calendar — dated from December 1 to December 24 — sets the festive momentum for Christmas gifts, treats and the season’s tidings. Advent calendars feature 24 compartments that are accented by as many flaps or doors that contain surprises ranging from gifts, toys, candies, chocolate or even a message or verse from the Bible. Though the calendar has its roots in Christian traditions, it took a secular route in the 19th Century. From a reference in Encyclopaedia Britannica, the first commercially printed calendars appeared sometime in the early 20th Century and German publisher Gerhard Lang in 1920s added small doors that opened to pictures in the calendar; “other publishers later included Bible verses”, the source states. It would be nearly impossible to trace the time and place of this European custom’s foray in India, but they have been steadily picking up steam for nearly a decade now. Here are a few Advent calendars, served with nuggets of history, which will make your countdown to Christmas merrier that ever. Sivako chocolate bar

TheMichelinKey, the hotel counterpart to the snooty Michelin Star, has finally arrived in the country.

1887,2025,The Hindu,1887,"Sanjay Garg’s ‘Once Upon a River’ is a surreal outing Three men walk out of a mist-covered forest, an eerie vocalisation keeping pace with their steps. Behind them are shadows. More people? Abaraat? The surreal image cuts to a groom on a white horse wandering along colonnaded corridors, disappearing into the mist, even as a bride withkohl-lined eyes emerges, an ululating chitter heightening the mood. Once Upon a Riverplays out like a fever dream. Yes, it’s a wedding-focused collection, but done the Raw Mango way. Because, as its founder designer Sanjay Garg puts it, the brand “is not defined by a single idea or aesthetic, but rather a constant questioning”. Here, the idea he chooses to question is that of unions, of coming together. “The Indian wedding is always bigger than the two people at the centre of it. The celebration is a union of families, thought processes, rituals and symbols,” he says. The campaign shot by Ashish Shah, a Raw Mango loyalist, unfolds in a surreal, dreamlike sequence: a model wrapped like a mummy in gold brocade wears an ornate hat topped with a handcrafted bird; a sightless horse is held aloft in boats lit by flaming torches. Motifs of the fish, horse and bird — handcrafted by Manan Sharma, a Delhi-based artist, from papier mâché, textile and metal structures — recur throughout the campaign. “We’ve touched on surrealism before. Somewhere, it requires you to trust in the ideas that originate in the subconscious mind,” shares Garg. “The bird, horse and fish can represent the worlds of the sky, the land and the sea. Each has a place in this story, and comes together in surprising ways.” Once Upon a Riveris a wedding-focused collection, but done the Raw Mango way This fluidity of unions spills into the surroundings, too. The campaign was filmed at Santrampur palace and, as Garg points out, it is not a mere backdrop. “I am from Rajasthan, which is perhaps why I’m drawn to palaces and the history behind them.

Patricia Théry Hart, director, Alliance Française of Madras, said that when they began this event three years ago in Chennai, the aim was to get more people to visit the Alliance campus. This is why they put together a well-curated list of performances — a fusion of French finesse and Tamil panache. This is a practice they continued following for the next two years, leading to a surge in the number of people visiting the festival each year. This year, the theme was based on the playMoulin Rouge! This time, the outdoor venue saw performances by bands like Office Ganaa and Uru Pannar. The main stage saw theatre plays that won accolades at the Short + Sweet festival by Prakriti Foundation. In line with the theme, contemporary dancer Preethi Athreya debuted her performanceRubber Girlin Chennai. Wild Wild Women, a group of fierce rappers, were also part of the mix. The usually silent library saw people singing to their heart’s content during the karaoke performance and an immersive cube that often splashed the images to techno and dubstep music by Omnivoid and Cursorama stole the show. Fashion designer Ashwin Thiyagarajan’s ensembles grew quite the crowds too as a makeshift ramp was arranged at the entrance of Alliance late in the evening.

India debut in Kala Ghoda, Mumbai On Wednesday evening, Parisian flair married Mumbai glamour in one of the most hotly anticipated luxury events this Diwali season. In honour of Galeries Lafayette’s much anticipated India debut, I was swept up in true Riviera style. With a pretty hand fan pressed into my hand, I was whisked by golf cart from the Royal Bombay Yacht Club to the jetty across from the Taj Hotel. From here, I hopped onto a waiting speed boat, which ferried me across the glittering waters to the elegant yacht Allegra. With the city’s iconic Colaba harbour as its cinematic backdrop, the storied 130-year-old French luxury department store floated giant red-and-white balloons above the Arabian Sea, while sailboats with its signature crimson flags drifted across the water. From the yachts moored offshore, an audience of editors, stylists, designers, and French and Indian executives looked on as the city witnessed a moment of pure Parisian spectacle — tying the city’s maritime legacy neatly into a historic moment for luxury retail in India. One of the most hotly anticipated debuts, it took almost eight years after their initial courtship for Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail Ltd (ABFRL) and Galeries Lafayette to open its doors in Kala Ghoda. Almost two years went towards painstaking building renovation. “We are supposed to be retailers, instead we became structural engineers and architects,” joked Ashish Dikshit, managing director of ABFRL, while enjoying a sunset cocktail on one of the boats. He added that he felt tremendously proud of the repurposing of two historic buildings, Turner Morrison and the neighbouring Voltas House.

1890,2025,The Hindu,1890,"India’s long battle with lymphatic filariasis: progress and the path aheadPremium In many Indian villages, people living with lymphatic filariasis still recall the day their leg began to swell. It starts innocuously, with a slight puffiness around the ankle or knee. Over time, the swelling hardens into something immovable - a weight they carry for life. Lymphatic filariasis, orhaathipaon(“elephant foot”), is one of India’s most persistent diseases. Caused by microscopic worms transmitted by theCulex mosquito, the disease silently invades the lymphatic system, blocking fluid flow and leaving limbs grotesquely swollen. The damage is irreversible. Unlike malaria or dengue, filariasis does not kill quickly. It disables - stripping away mobility, dignity and income. It is a leading cause of long-term disability worldwide, yet its victims often live unseen, tucked away in villages where the disease is both normalised and stigmatised. Mentions of filariasis date back to ancient Ayurvedic texts, yet the disease continues to remain embedded in India’s public health landscape. India today accounts for approximately40%of the global burden. An estimated 740 million Indians are at risk, andover 7,00,000live with its visible effects including limb swelling, scrotal hydrocele or milky white urine. The numbers are blurry, masked by shame and underreporting. In many rural districts, the disease is so commonplace that people no longer name it; they simply live with it, generation after generation. Infection begins in childhood. Mosquitoes transfer larvae into the bloodstream, which mature silently in the lymphatic vessels. Years later, irreversible deformity appears. For some, it emerges during adolescence, for others, not until middle age. But by then, the economic and emotional costs are already high. Filariasis thrives where sanitation fails, among open drains, stagnant water and inadequate healthcare. It also worsens the poverty that sustains it. For labourers and domestic workers,swollen limbs mean the end of livelihoods.

1891,2025,The Hindu,1891,"Slowing down fashion: Why India must rethink fast fashionPremium When India debates pollution, the spotlight usually falls on coal plants, cars, or power generation. Rarely do we look inside our wardrobes. Despite its polished and glamorous exterior, the fashion industry is, in reality, one of the dirtiest sectors in practice. On a global scale, the industry utilises approximately 79 billion cubic meters of water, contributes 8-10 % of greenhouse gas emissions, and generates 92 million tonnes of waste annually. India stands as the world’s third-largest textile exporter and a rapidly growing consumer market, positioning itself as both a contributor to the issue and a key player in any potential resolution.

From the time I decided in my early 20s that I would wear a lot of pants — for reasons ranging from rebellious (Western clothing!) to pragmatic (less waxing) — there have only been a small pool of heroes to choose from. Katharine Hepburn, Audrey Hepburn, and Diane Keaton became my holy trinity. While the Hepburns had their signature looks — Katharine championed wide-legged pants with button-down Oxford shirts and Audrey chose cigarette/capri pants with ballet flats — Diane Keaton wore her pants every which way. Cropped, wide-legged, boot cut, skinny, straight, and baggy. I discovered Keaton the last, sometime in mid-2010s, when herAnnie Hall(1977) look became the inspiration for a fashion season. While I only remember snippets from the film, her look — suit vests, men’s shoes, baggy pleated pants, knotted ties, and floppy hats — remains fresh. As has been endlessly chronicled since, it was a look that was very much Keaton’s own and it has been hailed as doing as much for pants in her time as Marlene Dietrich and Katharine Hepburn before her. This despite the fact that it had been around a decade since Yves Saint Laurent had introduced the tuxedo and pantsuit for women, and over half a century since Coco Chanel and Jean Patou had introduced pants for women to free them from restrictive clothing.

The collection comprising saris, jackets and layered separates was crafted majorly in silk. Even in khadi pieces, designer Gaurav Jai Gupta used silk.  Talking about the materiality, the designer shared, “The colour takes beautifully to silk because of its glaze, and that is what gives the radiance and depth.” For Gaurav, material selection is one of the most crucial factors when he weaves, it defines how the fabric will behave, how it will take colour, and ultimately how it will feel.

                                R. ASHOK Madurai has always had a cautious approach to fashion. For long, it revelled in shimmering half-saris, pleated pattu pavadais and elegant Sungudi saris draped on the young and the old. Till the early Nineties, blouses were simple and well-defined, with brocade on the borders for a bridal look.

Cut to 2025, and no eyebrows are raised when a young bride shells out ₹1 lakh for a heavily zardozi-worked blouse. Fashion in Madurai has steadily evolved. With exposure to cinema, social media, and travels  across the country, people are now drawn to fabrics, cuts, and embellishments. If Kushboo’s myriad blouses for a TV show tantalised the older generation, now, tailoring boutiques are drawing the younger crowd.

To cater to this varied customer base that is not just fashion conscious but also knows what it wants, these boutiques employ tailors from North India to create customised outfits, blending local weaves with patterns inspired by types of embroidery like aari work.

1902,2025,The Hindu,1902,"Jaipur’s royal legacy finds a contemporary voice in a jewellery and apparel collection There is something about Jaipur that stays with you — the warmth of its sandstone facades, the rhythm of its craftspeople at work, the regal hush of its palaces. It is this sense of history that the city-based jewellery brand Tribe Amrapali and The Palace Atelier have channelled into a jewellery collection that celebrates Jaipur’s royal legacy through a contemporary lens. The Palace Atelier, led by Gauravi Kumari — from the erstwhile ruling family of Jaipur — is a concept store started in 2024 that blends traditional crafts with modern design. “There have been integrations and collaborations I’ve done with other brands,” says Gauravi, “but this feels particularly special because it carries cultural and historical context and  sparks conversation. My great-grandfather, Man Singh  always intended for Jaipur to be a cultural capital — a city of the arts — and that spirit, I feel, had waned for a while. What we’re doing now, in our own small way, is reviving that purpose.” At the heart of the collection lies the Pachranga flag (which still flutters above Chandra Mahal at the City Palace) — the five-coloured royal emblem of the Kachwaha dynasty, first adopted by Raja Man Singh I in 1585 after his victory in Kabul. The flag’s stripes of red, white, yellow, green, and blue, representing earth, air, water, fire, and space, are woven into the conceptual fabric of the line. The designers avoid a literal translation, instead interpreting its vitality through colour, form, and rhythm — an aesthetic equilibrium that runs across the necklaces, earrings, bracelets, and rings.

1904,2025,The Hindu,1904,"Paris wax museum unveils new Diana figure in ‘revenge dress’ A wax museum in Paris on Thursday unveiled a new figure of the late Princess Diana depicted in a black dress that has come to be known as her “revenge dress,” decades after her tragic death in the city. The Grevin Museum, one of Europe’s oldest wax museums, dressed the life-size figure of the late Princess of Wales in the black, off-the-shoulder, figure-hugging cocktail dress Diana wore to a Serpentine Gallery event in London in 1994. It was the same night that King Charles III — atthe time Prince Charles— acknowledged on television that he had been unfaithful with Camilla Parker Bowles. For Paris, the tribute carried extra weight.Diana died in a car crashin a tunnel by the Seine River in 1997, and the city still draws admirers who leave flowers and notes at informal memorials. Diana’s relationship with Dodi Al Fayed andthe crash that killed themimmortalised Diana’s connection with Paris. Museum officials toldThe Associated Pressthat the Grevin director ordered the likeness after being underwhelmed by its counterpart during a visit to Madame Tussauds wax museum in London a couple of years ago. They noted that the unveiling came on the 30th anniversary of an explosive interview that Diana gave to BBC “Panorama,” which observers say dented the standing of the monarchy and the Queen. Some observers noted how the museum’s newest royal guest was positioned far from wax likenesses of her ex-husband and former mother-in-law. High heels, a pearl choker at her neck and a small handbag clasped in both hands completed the sculpture. Tabloids later dubbed the outfit the “revenge dress,” and the museum leaned into that symbolism. French novelist Christine Orban, who wrote “Mademoiselle Spencer,” a novel imagined from Diana’s point of view, said the figure was overdue. She called the black dress a turning pointin Diana’s story. “The dress is very significant of her liberation because in the royal family, black is only worn for funerals, and then such a sexy dress for a Princess o",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/paris-wax-museum-unveils-new-diana-figure-in-revenge-dress/article70306179.ece

Fabrics such as metallic silks, satins and velvets reflected the gleam of race-night lights, while sculpted tailoring and fluid drapes suggested motion even in stillness. The palette — rich in blacks, silvers and jewel tones — lent the collection an understated, nocturnal quality. “For us, Astride was about channelling the energy of racing — that sense of speed, control and anticipation — into couture,” says Rohit Gandhi. “Every garment carries a sense of momentum, whether it’s in a sharply cut jacket or the movement of a drape.” The evening’s theme, Fashion in its Purest Form, brought the focus back to craftsmanship and construction. “It was about stripping away the performative aspect and returning to the essentials — the cut, the form, and the detail,” explains Rahul. “The derby, much like couture, values discipline and precision, and we wanted that parallel to come through.” Malaika Arora walked the runway in a look from the collection tha",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/rohit-gandhi-rahul-khanna-present-astride-at-the-deccan-derby-2025/article70142537.ece

Some are naturally masculine, others feminine — Cartier is more feminine, Breitling more masculine, and perhaps only Rolex appeals to both genders in equal measure.

Technically, a thicker, coarser material takes more time to embroider, but the result feels both Indian and global,” says Pranav, whose design aesthetic is propelled  by the socio-political and cultural landscape. “So, for me now, it is about syncing with my roots and finding who I am,” he says, over the phone from Mumbai. Huemn returned to the runway with its SS’26, collaborating with the new Tata Sierra, at Mukesh Mills, a heritage building in Colaba, reinvented as a performance space. A 300-metre runway cut through the length of the mill and opened out to the sea, adding to the drama.  “For many of us, the Tata Sierra is something we grew up seeing on the road.

Speaking at the Border Security Force’s (BSF) 61st Raising Day event in Bhuj, Mr. Shah described the Election Commission’s Special Intensive Revision (SIR) as a “purification” of the voter list. “Today, the BSF is engaged in preventing infiltration at all borders of the country. Stopping infiltration is not only essential for national security but also to protect the democratic system of the country from being polluted,” he said. Mr. Shah accused certain political groups of opposing the SIR only to keep infiltrators on electoral rolls. “Some parties are against the ongoing SIR as they want to make sure that names of infiltrators remain on the voters’ list… SIR is a purification of voters’ list… We will deport every single infiltrator from this country.

It was neither a competitive race nor was there any pressure on them. People joined for fun, to up their fitness levels or to meet and build a community of like-minded individuals who like to run. Leading them were two college friends, Krishbir Singh and Jyotiraditya Thakur, who founded The Bhag Club (TBC) in June 2024with an objective to promote an athletic mindset among the people of Delhi NCR. “Post pandemic we noticed how peoples’ social lives were negatively affected,” says Jyotiraditya. Krishbir adds there has been a lack of both healthy habits and a sense of athleticism among the majority. Both of them felt community running would help to break the mental and social barriers. They wanted people to run for pleasure and whenever they feel like. “Running needs only motivation and a pair of good shoes unlike other sports that require investment,” says Jyotiraditya. The idea was good but to get things going was not easy. A lot depended on how they marketed the concept. “We had to think of a strategy that would appeal to the young and make them feel it is good and cool to run,” Krishbir says.

Closer home however, the sands of Besant Nagar beach that has several teams come together to play Ultimate Frisbee through the year has an inspiring, and almost equally cinematic story to tell. At the TRIO Invitational Tournament 2025 held in Kuala Lumpur earlier this year, Flywild, one of Chennai’s most promising Ultimate Frisbee clubs clinched the gold, becoming the first club team from India to win an international tournament.  Facing off  players from different countries including Indonesia, China, Japan, Thailand, and USA, Flywild played a well-fought final against the team Pancake Men from Philippines and emerged victorious, in what was also the club’s first international tournament participation. Sedric Emmanuel, the team’s captain, says they initially lost two matches and won one, which meant their fourth match was to decide if they would make it to the quarter-finals.  “We initially struggled through that match. While we play with no pressure back home in Chennai, this was a lot more challenging. We  motivated each other as a team and got through,” he says. Once they were in the quarter-finals, their winning streak continued. The tournament was a culmination of four months of practice, and special camps. “While some of us have played internationally as  part of team India in other international tournaments, this was the first international travel experience for many other members,” says Siva Raman, who coached the team and topped the stats board in the tourney as the player with the most goals and assists. “We took this as a challenge, and decided to create history for Ultimate in India,” he adds. Many young players on the team have inspiring stories to tell, of how their passion for the sport has changed their lives  and  kept them going through hard times.

In contrast, Sanskrit, “a dead language,” was getting ₹2,400 crore, he said.

When Alexander VS founded Bounce Fitness Studio at Panampilly Nagar in Kochi eight years ago, he insisted that it be a “nurturing space” rather than a “torturing” one. A fitness professional for over 25 years, he consciously decided to take a couple of steps backward. “Fitness cannot be seen as an isolated objective. It is a combination of various factors that trace back to a person’s way of life — eating and sleep patterns, time in nature, the activities carried out in a day, life circumstances, history of illnesses and overall sense of wellbeing,” he says. Therefore, every workout plan is different, based on what suits the person. “We have come a long way from the Arnold Schwarzenegger-inspired body building clubs, where we associated fitness solely to having a six pack.” Bounce Fitness Studio

This all-women team, the Team India Masters Women, has players from different cities including Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Delhi, Kochi and Chennai, who have come together for their monthly camp in Chennai in the run-up to the World Beach Ultimate Championships (WBUC) in Portimão, Portugal, from November 16 to 22. “This is the first time that India is sending an all-women team in the Masters category for an international tournament.

Run faster and you will get there quicker!”, is all we hear and do in our lives.  We are constantly surrounded by the demand to cope no matter how. On the other end of the spectrum, our ancient practices teach us to be still. Yoga and classical dance are both indigenous traditions of India that seek the same goal  — to be aware of the breath and let thepraanaguide every action.  To engage both the body and the mind to act at once for a holistic experience.  The ancient practices suggest that we pause to  engage deeply  with life, and  compassionately with ourselves. Yoga enables the mind-body balance that help us make  better choices for living. Dancers are complex movement artistes. They have to be  contortionists, martial artists, poets, story tellers and sculptors all at once. They do not just bring an idea to life when they dance but create life itself in each moment.  As a dancer, my body changes every moment to adhere to a complexly shifting mind.

A professional tennis player for over 16 years who has won the gold medal in the Khelo India Games 2020, Vimalraj says he is thrilled with this win, and says that the countless hours of playing Tennis esports over the last three years has been worth it. Played by a mix of amateur and professional players, Esports tournaments such as this one are structured, competitive video game tournaments that draw in a significant number of spectators. From over five lakh players across the world, 16 top players from countries including Switzerland, France, and USA earned their spots in the WTEC finals at Vegas through eight National Leagues and the Tennis Esports tour. “To qualify for the finals, I had to play several tournaments in the US time zone, but from my home in Chennai and in the process lost a lot of sleep,” he laughs. “Playing these games is an intense ordeal for many players, and I was thankful that I had a good, comfortable space at home to play out of,” he adds. He was backed by India-based Esports company NoScope Gaming.

Her class does not start for another half an hour but she enjoys the occasional chat with her mates before she begins loading her barbell with weights earmarked for her lifts. “Everyone is so friendly here. I enjoy speaking to them. If not, I tend to catch up with my book. Right after, I pick up my weights,” she says. In May this year, Safira lifted 65 kilograms on her deadlift set. Until three years ago when she began her lifting training, she had ‘sub-zero’ athletic abilities, she says, laughing. “Before the lockdown, my son tried to get me to lift but I was very reluctant. Historically, we have heard false news claiming that lifting will ‘affect’ the uterus. It got me worried. But during the pandemic, many doctors put up videos endorsing strength training. I was intent on joining an all-women’s gym because I wanted to feel comfortable. I am now hooked. I take myproteinafter class and ensure that I hit a gram for every kilogram of my body weight,” she says. Safira says that when she first joined the gym, she wore a salwar kameez and dupatta. No questions were asked. Over time, she has warmed up to the idea of tracksuits. Her son runs a gym too but she prefers being here as this women’s-only gym is a liberating space where she is focussed on getting strong, ensuring that she does not depend on kin for care in her 70s. “I want to cook, clean and fend for myself at that age,” she says. “I like coming here because I am able to see women  older than me, causally lifting heavy weights. Younger people too. There is an extra energy. My  mythical aches and pains have disappeared too,” she says.

Instead, he quietly takes a constable’s phone while the officer dozes off, slips back into the lockup, and starts watching reels. With moments like this, director Navaneeth lays out the film’s grammar early on — through the quirks of the principal characters played byPriyadarshiandAnandhi, and even through this random man in the station — signalling thatPremante(love means…) is not a conventional relationship drama. Anything can happen, and the film wants viewers to simply go along for the ride. Madhusudhan (Priyadarshi) and Ramya (Anandhi) meet at a wedding — one where the bride had earlier rejected him and the groom had rejected her in their respective matchmaking rounds. The couple getting married is nicknamed #SaiKo, a cheeky nod to wedding-trend culture on social media. Madhusudhan and Ramya’s meet-cute unfolds over their shared love for mutton biryani, her stubborn streak, her OCD tendencies, and her craving for adventure — even if it means doing the unthinkable. Love blossoms and both families are relieved that their matrimonial searches can finally end. All seems well until friction arises — his night shifts keep him away, and she feels neglected. From here, the story throws up one twist after another. It is disconcerting, because the central conflict is rooted in very real middle-class pressures — an ailing parent, medical debt, and a family home under threat. Premante…briefly examines the moral compass of its protagonists before shifting gears into a logic-defying ride. Underneath the chaos is Ramya’s desire to reclaim the right to make her own decisions, after years of being controlled by her father. Her stubborn insistence on doing things her way takes the narrative into unexpectedly bizarre — often funny, often exasperating — territory.

At The Arena inside this campus, where the Chennai Open was recently played, you would hardly think ofpickleballas a nascent sport. With more than 500 registrations across 40-plus categories, players battled for on-court glory and a prize pool of ₹25 lakh in a sport that blends badminton, tennis and table tennis — earning it the catchphrase: “the game anyone can play”. In the middle of  the action is actress Samantha, whom many of us know as  the leading lady of superhit films likeTheriandRangasthalam. As the owner of Chennai Super Champs, which will compete at the World Pickleball League Season 2 beginning January 2026, the actor is determined to use her star power to draw attention to the sport. “My biggest dream has been to see India go from being a sports-watching nation to a sports-playing one,”  she states, “Pickleball will take us there... because it is the most non-intimidating sport.

For most trail runners, UTMB is not just another ultramarathon; it is a rite of passage, one that demands years of preparation and patience even to earn a place on the starting line. It is an annual trail running event held in the Chamonix valley, which circles the Mont Blanc massif through France, Italy and Switzerland. This ultramarathon race is famous for its gruelling distance of around 170-176 kilometres and extreme elevation gain, making it one of the world’s most prestigious and toughest endurance tests for elite and amateur runners alike. Out of 2,492 participants this year, 1,665 managed to complete the course. For 41-year-old Viswabharath, who had aimed for 32 to 35 hours but battled through unexpected setbacks, the finish itself carried the weight of victory. “The UTMB finals are like a holy grail for trail runners,” he reflects. “Runners wait years to get a chance, unless they are elite. For me, reaching the finish line, despite the pain and the delays was a win.” With his roots in Guntur in Andhra Pradesh, Viswabarath’s relationship with running did not begin in childhood nor did he have structured training. He describes himself as someone who always dabbled in sports but never consistently. What changed was the Covid-19 lockdown. Confined to his home in France, where he is currently based, with only trips to the supermarket for relief, he decided to step outside for a five-kilometre run one afternoon  The sensation of sunlight and fresh air struck him deeply. That decision soon led to regular outings and a new rhythm to life. His early days were shaped by guidance from others.

Nagar with one common goal: to jump-start their day with fun and fitness. Armed with colourful jump ropes, they quickly began swinging them and jumping in rhythm. On the other side stood the instructor, G. Aravindaakshan — a self-taught jump rope enthusiast and founder of Chennai Jumps — guiding the group through the nuances of rope jumping. Over the past few months, Chennai Jumps has hosted several workshops, including activities at Chitlapakkam Lake and Anna Nagar Tower Park, among others. “Jump rope is a tool that is under rated and which is not spoken about. It has a lot of health benefits too,” Mr. Aravindaakshan said. He began skipping during the Covid pandemic and gradually discovered that this simple tool offered much more — with a variety of techniques and possibilities to explore. “I learnt a lot of techniques from YouTube and Instagram and practiced regularly. This helps individuals physically and mentally. When you jump, your full focus shifts to yourself — where your hands need to be and how you need to jump,” he says. According to Mr. Aravindaakshan, jump rope is a highly accessible activity that can be done anytime, anywhere. “All you need is a little space to jump,” he says. “It’s also budget-friendly — your only real investment is the rope itself.” Currently, Chennai Jumps includes participants in age ranging from just 5 years old to 66. In the coming months, Aravindaakshan plans to bring this activity to more public spaces and schools across the city. He intends to create a professional academy for jump rope. Mr. Aravindaakshan charges a nominal fee of ₹100 from those joining his community. “My goal is to create awareness,” he says, “but I also need to cover the cost of the ropes, so I charge this small amount.”",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/jump-rope-for-fun-and-fitness-a-new-community-rises-in-chennai/article69843742.ece

The former South African cricketer has always waxed eloquent on his love of India, and has over the years, enthusiastically taken to the waves in Kovalam and Mamallapuram. “This is probably the first town where the fishing community and the surfing community have come together for surfing. A consistent wave, and great people have enabled the growth of the sport here, which is what I love about Mamallapuram,” says the ambassador for the Surfing Federation of India (SFI). Having seen the emergence of surf stars in the coast here, Jonty is full of praise for young Harish in team India, and a host of other younger athletes. “In India, many surfers come from humble backgrounds and it is not just about them and their surfing, but about the contributions they have received from the community and what they are giving back,” he says. Jonty says for him, it isn’t just to see the rise in talent and how their skills as an athlete advance, but how at such a young age they feel responsible to their communities. “You don’t get to see this often in any sport across the world,” he says. Likening the ongoing ASF Asian Surfing Championships 2025 to the IPL, Jonty says that like cricket which is played so differently and in varying conditions across the world, this competition will enable the athletes here to learn a lot. “You can practise as hard as you want, but you learn so much in competition. All these surfers from across Asia have developed skills from every wave they ride, and the best way for us to develop surfing in India is to carry on competing against surfers from different parts of the world,” he explains. As someone who has made the sea here his home as a surfer, Jonty asks surfers across the world making a beeline for Mamallapuram, both for sport and leisure to bring along their ‘A Game’. “It is a fast, powerful wave.

Dr Ambrish Mithal and Raj Ganpath discuss If you’ve ever tried to lose weight, cutting calories and spending long hours in the gym, this thought must have occurred to you: “I wish there were a pill I could pop and take care of it.” Turns out that there may be a possibility, going by the host of GLP-1 drugs, including Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus, that have flooded the market. What is also clear, however, is that while these drugs may be an effective tool for some people, old-school lifestyle choices, exercise, nutrition, stress management, and sleep cannot be ignored. Fitness and nutrition coach, Raj Ganpath, co-founder of The Quad, talks to endocrinologist Dr Ambrish Mithal, the author of the recently-released book,The Weight Loss Revolution,published by Juggernaut, to answer the many questions potential users may have. They explain who should or should not be taking them and why this does not mean you stop working out and eating well. Edited extracts of an interview Raj Ganpath (RG): Thank you for writing the book, the  first book on weight loss drugs and how to use them in India. So, my first question to you is, what is the problem with weight loss today, and why do you think the existing solutions — exercise, nutrition, and lifestyle changes — don’t work? Dr Ambrish Mithal (AM): The first is that we have to understand why there is a sort of epidemic of obesity: weight loss is a problem because there is too much weight gain these days. And that, of course, is dependent on the environment we grow up in, as well as our habits, which are very different from those of the generation before us. I think the environment encourages unhealthy eating and easy quick fixes, and that’s why the prevalence of obesity is going up. The second part, of course, is that we have always been trained, even as endocrinologists, to think of obesity as basically because someone is eating too much and not exercising. That is still true to some extent, but the difference is understanding that obesity is a brain disease.

While not visible for all users on Friday, some X users could navigate to an account’s bio and select the date it had joined Twitter in order to see where the account was based. X head of product Nikita Bier posted on October 14 that the move was aimed at helping users verify content. “When you read content on X, you should be able to verify its authenticity. This is critical to getting a pulse on important issues happening in the world. As part of that, we’re experimenting with displaying new information on profiles, including which country an account is based, among other details.

The new update let some users see where and when the X account was created, its verification status, where it was based, the number of username changes, and through which country’s app store it was connected. Supporters of the move felt that country-based labels would make it easier to identify accounts spreading misinformation, interfering in foreign affairs, farming engagement in unethical ways, or impersonating a user from another part of the world.

Within a few minutes of playing the game, Ajay, an athlete during his early days, could rally with ease. Later, when he moved to Bengaluru, he became further acquainted with the sport while witnessing the growth of communities surrounding the sport. Soon, Ajay started Spinz Pickleball (Instagram handle: @spinz_pickleball), a space exclusively for the sport, with his schoolmates Sharath Varghese, Yadu Manoj and Lawrence Moraira, at Pongumoodu in Thiruvananthapuram, where the sport has been gaining momentum during recent months. Much like Ajay, entrepreneurs are setting up courts exclusively for pickleball across the Kerala capital after being exposed tothe sport in Tier 1 cities such as Bengaluru and Chennai, among others.Ventures such as The Happy Court, Sportonix Pickleball, and Zero Fitness Performance Studio have helped forge a following for the sport in the city, initially played on badminton courts due to the similarity in dimensions of the court.

Not too long ago, the 39-year-old participated in the Backyard Ultra Bangalore, running for 28 hours and setting the national record for women at 187.6 kms in the process. Backyard Ultra is an ultra-marathon event that was founded in 1910 by Gary Cantrell from Tenessee, USA, that requires participants to complete one loop (one kilometre) in one hour in order to enter the next loop. The unique feature of the race is the lack of a finish line; the race is declared over when only one participant remains to complete the loop. The Bengaluru edition of the race took place recently. “In this format, the most interesting thing is that your family and friends can come and support you, so more than an individual pursuit, it becomes a community activity,” notes Ashwini, who finished second. Ashwini Ganapathi Bhat recalls being athletically-inclined since childhood, engaging in field hockey and other sports since her school days, but she ran a marathon for the first time as an IT professional at an event organised by her company. “We are used to races being about finishing first, but I was intrigued by the distance. It was never about how fast I could cover the distance, but how far I could go.” The fascination with distance led Ashwini to quit her job in 2016, and after a year as a professional photographer, she decided to become a full-time runner. “I realised quite early on, that I have a lot of endurance, which helps one last longer in a race. That is how ultra running happened,” she says, explaining the switch from small distance runs, trails and marathons to ultra events. Running, for Ashwini, has primarily created a global community that looks out for each other and induces perseverance in one another. “Once, I had to travel to the United States for a hundred-miler, and needed an affordable place t",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fitness/marathoner-ashwini-bhat-on-running-the-ultra-mile/article69606360.ece

But as India’s silver economy gathers pace, the landscape is rapidly expanding. More towns across the State are emerging as attractive destinations for senior-living real estate, with Chennai now taking a leading position. Real estate developers — from Tamil Nadu and other parts of India — are increasingly betting on the city. Reflecting this growing trend, Communities — a Niranjan Hiranandani Group initiative — announced its strategic entry into the emerging asset class of premium senior living earlier this week. The launch of ‘Elements’ will take place at Hiranandani Parks, Oragadam, an integrated township in Chennai. This particular project is being developed in partnership with GTB Urban Developers. When asked why the group chose Chennai for its first project in this segment, Niranjan Hiranandani, founder and chairman, Hiranandani Communities, said that the group has always done things differently. He pointed out that when the group first ventured into Oragadam, there were hardly any major developers in the area, but today, the region has witnessed a surge in real estate activity with several prominent players setting up projects there. “We have been able to set the precedence,” he said. Spread across 4.5 acres with a development potential of one million sq. ft., the project will feature 400 residences to be developed in two phases. Each residence will be a thoughtfully designed 2-BHK unit of approximately 700 sq. ft., priced from ₹60 lakh onwards. The overall project value is estimated at ₹300 crore.

1947,2025,The Hindu,1947,"How mixed-use developments are reshaping India’s mini-metro skylines There has been a notable change in the skylines of various cities in India over the past 10 years. The shift is credited to mixed-use development real estate, which integrates residential spaces with commercial, retail, leisure, and cultural spaces, all in one project. The outcome is a self-contained ecosystem allowing residents to work, socialise and shop all in one area. Many realtors are willing to take on the challenge of breaking the borders of sandunes as they are sure to construct a sustainable, engaging and connected urban area from previously empty land. The shift from standalone malls and gated residential colonies to mixed-use areas is a significant improvement in urban planning. For developers, mixed-use projects maximise land use, increase profits, and make neighbourhoods more resilient to economic ups and downs. Forward-thinking realtors are filling this void by adapting under-utilised spaces into vibrant, eco-friendly urban places that are walkable, bringing the convergence of these trends to neighbourhood life, in the process, rethinking the way cities are planned. Apartments in a mixed-use development certainly take more land to construct than a freestanding apartment. Factors such as increased convenience of lifestyle and consumer satisfaction are more than plausible, as is a more optimised profit for the developers. The introduction of mixed-use projects, on the other hand, radically improves this vocabulary. They serve multiple functions within a single, concentrated block, especially in the mini-metro cities of Pune, Kochi, Indore and Ahmedabad. These cities are growing at the fastest rate and need to utilise space vertically to satisfy the needs of an aspiring younger workforce that desires easy access and connectivity. Mini-metros can be at the forefront of this shift. Unlike megacities such as Mumbai and Delhi, they are not constrained by urban legacies and are adopting integrated townships more quickly.

Miniature artist Sukanya Ayde’sThe Prince, The Parrot, and The Horsedepicts a beloved tale of friendship, executed playfully yet with artistic precision. The first window draws you into a lush, deep forest with the three protagonists, and the second window, the opulent palace. The prince, symbolic of royalty and lineage, watches his horse drink from a decorative tray. The stallion, a worthy companion, is a nod to Hermès’s equestrian roots, a heritage that began with harness-making in 1837. Perched on a crescent moon is the parrot, a storyteller and the artist’s muse. Sukanya Ayde “It becomes a stage where these characters reflect the Hermès spirit: craft and culture brought to life through dialogue between tradition and modernity, object and narrative, art and storytelling,” says Ayde, who started working on Hermès’s 2025 theme, ‘Drawn to Craft’, in January, delving into the Maison’s iconic symbolism — the horse, the carré, the lock, the harness — merging them seamlessly with her own visual language. As Hermès’s global footprint stretched across the globe, its collaborations with local artists bloomed. Hermès’s whimsy-infused window displays began by happenstance in the 1930s. A young sales assistant, Annie Beaumel, stepped in to replace the rather decorous window manager who called in sick.

In Kerala, ancestral ortharavaduarchitecture was built for large, multi-generational families, on expansive plots of land, with laterite, jackwood (anjili) and teak, enveloped by generous porches for visitors, and rooms to accommodate slow living. Today, as most families move to the city, there is both a push and pull — do you transplant a home or conserve and retrofit for modern comforts? In 2011, Delhi-based architect Pradeep Sachdeva transplanted his 300-year-old home, Meda — from the village of Mepral, in Kerala, to his agricultural farm in Gurugram. Elsewhere, the Stapati architectural practice has taken this style of architecture to beachfront properties in Goa, a little slice of Kerala with laterite colonnades, and stone flooring, borrowing from vernacular architecture. This style is easily adaptable because it is climate responsive — pitched roofs to accommodate the messy monsoons — as it is built with local material that is both sustainable and rooted in culture. We speak to architects across South India, working at the intersection of restoration and adaptive reuse, on howtharavaduarchitecture can transition to meet the needs of families today. In terms of functionality and materiality, Benny Kuriakose opines that a seismic lifestyle shift has necessitated changes. “Earlier, we had a vessel or space outdoors to wash our feet before we entered; today, we do not have these customs in most places. This change in practices is reflected in design. A need for brighter spaces calls for large windows. Now people are realising the historical value of the houses and instead of demolishing, there is a focus on conservation.” Benny Kuriakose The durability of these buildings is indisputable; they’ve lasted over 200-300 years.

Luxe, luscious vegetation on every balcony could easily become a trend not only related to aesthetics or life style but also with real estate market value. Indeed, the symbiosis of beautifully maintained beautiful public outdoor spaces and property prices is seen as completely redefining how people who live in or are developing properties view terraces. The appeal of a property—and thus its market value—changes notably with a beautifully landscaped balcony. Take the concept of the “green premium,” a bump in value associated with appealing outdoor spaces — particularly those that are landscaped or otherwise have thoughtful design. In cities with a high population rate and very less outdoor amenities, a designer balcony garden can serve as your personal luxury amenity space which not only attracts the attention of potential buyers or tenants. The market confirms that having private exterior areas, like patios with potted plants, will allow you to charge even 12% more compared to homes in the same area but without them. It’s simple – greenery is warming, extends a lounging square footage, and most importantly, creates a vision of wellness and relaxation. Humans pay for these advantages: the overgrown balconies, vertical gardens and potted ornamentals that can transform a compact city apartment into a haven. Not all balcony botanicals are created equal. Their market value impact will vary depending on the calibre and design of these green spaces.

In response, the BIAL is reviewing and refining its processes to enhance the passenger experience, ease congestion and align with evolving needs and safety standards. According to BIAL, prolonged waiting by private cars and cabs creates artificial congestion, hindering traffic flow and inconveniencing passengers and drivers. To address this and to improve the passenger experience, BIAL is introducing a lane segregation system to enforce discipline, prevent unauthorised parking, and reduce dwell times.

1957,2025,The Hindu,1957,"Gurugram’s glamour, growth and global appealPremium A decade ago, Gurugram was seen purely as a corporate enclave. Known for its proximity to Delhi yet firmly a part of Haryana, it has since transformed into a self-contained city with its own distinct identity. But step into Gurugram today, and it would feel like the city has found its rhythm, a seamless combination of business ambition and cosmopolitan flair. The corporate glass facades still gleam, but parallely, a new pulse has taken over. Cafe terraces buzz with conversations, boutique storefronts have become social hotspots, and high streets stay alive long after office hours end. This evolution marks Gurugram’s shift from a business hub into a global lifestyle destination that appeals to corporates, talent, developers, and investors alike. Leading global developers such as CapitaLand, Hines, Tishman Speyer, Tata Realty & Infrastructure, Oberoi, Prestige, Godrej, Mahindra, and Birla have all joined this growth momentum. At the centre of this transformation is a powerful wave of retail-led development, where high-street retail, F&B zones, and experiential spaces are being thoughtfully integrated into mixed-use environments. Developers are creating urban ecosystems where professionals can work, shop, dine and unwind, all within the same environment. The result is a city that doesn’t just host global enterprises but entertains, engages and inspires the people who drive them. Recent data shows that Gurugram accounted for 68% of total retail leasing in Delhi NCR during Q3 2025, highlighting its dominance in the high-street and mall leasing arena. This retail upliftment happens in diverse formats. Premium international fashion brands now share addresses with Fortune 500 companies.

1958,2025,The Hindu,1958,"Bengaluru’s housing market finds stability in the mid-segment The housing market in Bengaluru continues to evolve and thrive, proving itself resilient, adaptive, and full of opportunity. Bengaluru’s real estate narrative is no longer defined by extremes of affordability or luxury but by the steady and confident rise of the mid-segment housing market. This reflects the growing preference for homes that balance aspiration with affordability. The current momentum is powered by major infrastructure development across the city. This includes metro extensions, new transport corridors, and expanding social infrastructure across Bengaluru’s north, east, and southeast. The result is consistent absorption and sustained demand for mid-segment homes. These changes are redefining what ‘livable’ means and expanding the city’s housing map far beyond traditional boundaries. While mid-market housing continues to flourish, the premium segment shows signs of fatigue. It points to affordability pressures that are making homebuyers in this category more cautious. They are taking longer to decide, negotiating harder, and waiting for better value. Developers, in turn, are offering flexible payment plans and discounts, yet sales momentum remains sluggish. The reasons are clear: rising ticket sizes have stretched purchasing power, while income growth has not kept pace with housing prices. Add to that global economic uncertainty and job transitions in the technology sector. As a result, buyers are cautious about big-ticket purchases — and understandably so. Homes priced between ₹65 lakh and ₹1 crore continue to form the core of Bengaluru’s housing demand. These homes cater to salaried professionals earning between ₹10 and ₹20 lakh annually. Moreover, household incomes in this bracket have grown steadily, from ₹18 lakh-₹25 lakh in 2022 to ₹22 lakh–₹30 lakh in 2024. This allows for greater comfort and confidence in home-buying decisions.

Industrial and commercial hubs like Mumbai, Bengaluru and Delhi have always been at the forefront of driving the country’s commercial realty market, but a secondary wave of smaller, more dynamic cities is changing the landscape, offering a range of opportunities for developers, investors and businesses. Mini Metros — smaller cities with populations of anywhere between one and four million — may not hold the skyline glory that their larger counterparts do, but their buzz is clear. These are also State capitals or regional hubs like Pune, Chandigarh, Mysuru, Coimbatore, and Guwahati, where there are good industrial bases, IT parks, educational institutions, and infrastructure is also developing. Their expanding business presence has added allure for business and real estate development. Several reasons underpin why Mini Metros are emerging as the new commercial real estate strongholds. First, better infrastructural connectivity through highways, airports and rail links has made these cities more connected to business and talent. Second, lower overhead costs than traditional metros attract startups and SMEs searching for low-cost office spaces. Third, there are favourable business environments into which industrial corridors and special economic zones have been promoted by government policy. Together, they’ve created a growing ecosystem, one in which sectors like IT, manufacturing, healthcare, education, and retail are all scaling quickly. The easy access and gradual influx of foreign companies and their Indian counterparts have triggered demand for office spaces, commercial complexes, and retail outlets across the Mini Metros.

1960,2025,The Hindu,1960,"Navi Mumbai airport and the making of a cityPremium Like greenfield airports around the world that created tremendous opportunities for their regions and led to the making of global cities around them, the recently inaugurated and soon-to-open Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) is poised to have a similar impact. Set up by Adani Airports and state entity CIDCO, it is expected to transform the Ulwe-Panvel corridor into an emerging global city and a real estate gold mine. This airport was first conceived about 35 years ago. It is expected to not only ease the burden on Mumbai’s existing airport but also to emerge as the epicentre of economic and real estate transformation. “We are seeing a pattern of building new airports in India emerging from Navi Mumbai to Noida’s Jewar and earlier in Hyderabad and Bengaluru. It begins with rapid-fire infrastructure upgrades such as expressways and Metro connections, and then proceeds to the development of aerocities,” said Anuj Puri, chairman, Anarock Group. A view of Navi Mumbai airport. “These include commercial office spaces, hotels, retail, and logistics hubs within a 5km to 10km radius. Housing demand rises by between 20% and 30%, more or less in tandem with the rate of job generation. Naturally, this results in prices rising by anywhere between 10% and 20% annually in the first few years,” he said. “Such airport-based ecosystems emulate the best practices seen around the world and gradually become self-sustaining economic zones in their own right. They will draw in massive aeronautical and non-aeronautical revenue over the coming years,” he added. Obviously, early investors in micro-markets near airports have a strong first-mover advantage and will turn very decent profits as India’s aviation industry continues to grow, he pointed out.

1963,2025,The Hindu,1963,"India’s warehousing transformation gets a global edge The global warehousing industry is at an inflexion point. Sustainability, automation, robotics, and data-driven intelligence are no longer optional — they are fast becoming the backbone of resilient supply chains. India, with its unprecedented growth in manufacturing, 3PL, and e-commerce, is uniquely positioned not only to adopt these global trends but also to adapt and redefine them for the world. India’s e-commerce revolution, for instance, is rewriting the rules of last-mile delivery and urban warehousing. While global players deploy advanced robotics, Indian operators are innovating with modular, cost-sensitive automation that fits local realities. This blend of cutting-edge technology with pragmatic solutions demonstrates a key truth: India is not merely a recipient of global best practices but an active contributor to the evolution of modern logistics. The numbers reinforce this trajectory. In just the first half of 2025, leasing activity across the top eight cities crossed 32 million square feet — a staggering 42% year-on-year jump, as Knight Frank reports. Cities such as Mumbai and Chennai are emerging as powerhouses of demand, with third-party logistics alone driving nearly a third of the activity. This reflects a decisive shift towards Grade A warehouses, stronger compliance, and sophisticated supply chains that are future-ready. Yet, growth at this scale is not without its challenges. Land acquisition hurdles, high capital intensity for advanced automation, and the need for workforce upskilling are real bottlenecks. Mid-size players, in particular, risk being left behind unless the ecosystem embraces collaborative solutions and robust public-private partnerships. If India’s warehousing story is to remain inclusive and sustainable, we must bridge this as we continue to grow. That being said, the opportunities for India are showing no signs of slowing down.

It’s a very well-planned strategy on the part of both the central and state governments to kick-start economic growth, and guess what: smart real estate investors are paying close attention. From Noida’s expanding expressways to Gurgaon’s skyscrapers, and Dwarka’s systematic rise into a future-ready sub-city, infrastructure has emerged as the silent catalyst powering both commercial and residential real estate development. Delhi-NCR has always been a magnet for real estate investment, but what’s happening now is different. It’s strategic. It’s policy-backed. And it’s unlocking new economic centres that weren’t even on the map a decade ago. Take Noida International Airport in Jewar, for instance. What was once a sleepy patch of land is now being reimagined as India’s next global hub. With excellent connectivity, logistics parks, and premium commercial corridors being developed around it, Jewar is becoming a hotspot for both retail and institutional investors. Then there’s Dwarka Expressway – possibly one of the most talked-about infrastructure projects in the region. Extend from Shiv Murti on NH-8 to Kherki Daula, this corridor is explaining how Gurgaon and Delhi connect. Along this route, we’re seeing a boost in high-end residential project offerings, premium office spaces, and hospitality projects that are being part up by investors long before they hit the market. And do not forget Noida, Greater Noida Expressway and Yamuna Expressway, which have become capital of tech campuses, co-working spaces, mixed-use commercial developments, and luxury residential communities. While residential real estate continues to evolve with shifting lifestyle preferences, commercial real estate in Delhi-NCR is currently enjoying one of its strongest growth phases.

Intrinsically associated with memory and emotion, perfumes and aroma play a major role in influencing the mood and atmosphere of any space.  In fact, Bengaluru airport recently introduced a special scent ‘Dancing Bamboo’. This was Bengaluru International Airport’s signature scent developed in collaboration with Aéromé around August this year.  It is diffused mainly in Terminal 2 (T2) of BLR Airport, in areas like check-in and arrival zones. The scent is described as having a rooted, earthy aroma with notes of wood, leather and spice. The idea? To make travellers feel relaxed and more at home. Apart from airports, offices, luxury hotels, even homes boast of signature fragrances which elevate the ambience of the space. Scent today is rapidly moving from an optional lifestyle addition to an integral component of high-end and holistic interior design.

1967,2025,The Hindu,1967,"Why Indian homes are rethinking the open kitchen trend Open kitchens are a popular trend when we talk about modern Indian homes. They look visually appealing, offer a smooth flow between spaces, and reflect a sense of openness. However, behind their beautiful appearance lies a debate: is an open kitchen more about looking neat and stylish, or is it about making cooking easy and practical? This is the open kitchen conundrum. On the one hand is the desire for a clean, clutter-free, and Instagram-worthy space. On the other, is the need for a kitchen that serves its primary purpose by being functional, efficient, and comfortable for everyday use. Open kitchens were once rare in Indian homes. But in the past decade, they have found a strong place in urban apartments and villas. The idea is quite simple: remove the wall between the kitchen and the living or dining area so as to create a more connected and spacious look. This design has many benefits. It allows families to interact more. A parent can cook while talking to their children, doing homework nearby. Guests feel more involved during gatherings, and the home feels bigger and brighter due to better light and airflow. One of the biggest appeals of an open kitchen is how it looks. Clean lines, matching cabinets, hidden appliances, and empty countertops give a sense of calm and order. This design choice reflects the growing trend of minimalism and modern living. However, to maintain this look, many homeowners feel the pressure to keep everything clean and orderly all the time. Even a small pile of dishes or spice jars on the countertop can seem like visual noise. As a result, open kitchens are often built with more storage solutions and clever hiding spots for tools and ingredients. Modular kitchen setups are best when it comes to making a kitchen look modern and stylish. And interior designers and architects are playing an important role in this shift. Many are revisiting traditional open kitchens by adding flexible elements.

1969,2025,The Hindu,1969,"How technology is rewriting India’s land storyPremium For generations, land has been India’s most enduring and sentimental investment, symbolising stability, legacy, and wealth creation. Yet, for many buyers, the path to that promise has been uneven, be it due to unclear titles, scattered records, opaque processes or inflated valuations and unreliable intermediaries that have kept confidence low. But what’s changing today is how it’s being perceived. Land is increasingly being viewed as a serious investment asset driven by better technology, greater transparency, and enhanced convenience and security for buyers. Recent market readings echo this shift in trend: Colliers India (Q3 2025) reports $1.3 billion in institutional flows, up 11% year-on-year, with domestic investors forming about 60% of the total. Industry projections also suggest real estate could account for 14%–20% of India’s GDP by 2047, a potential $10 trillion growth lever. As digital processes simplify discovery, verification, and ownership, investors are looking beyond vertical development to the clarity and control that land offers. Once seen primarily as an emotional pursuit, land is now emerging as a structured, technology-enabled asset class that promises both trust and long-term value. India has been quietly building the skeleton for a more trustworthy land market, making records searchable, registration predictable, and boundaries visible. These reforms allow buyers to see the past of a land parcel, track the present of a transaction, and trust the future of a neighbourhood. At the core lies the Digital India Land Records Modernisation Programme (DILRMP).

However, the disruption also pushed many in the industry to rethink resilience, innovation, and the very foundations of how they operate. One striking example stands right in the heart of Tiruppur. A dynamic glass facade that plays on optical illusion turns heads for its minimal yet striking design as one enters the garment manufacturing facility of SAGS Apparels in Tiruppur. On a built-up area of 52,900 sq.ft., with one-third of the land devoted to landscaping, this industrial building buzzing with over 400 staff has earmarked spaces for greenery, and boasts naturally-lit workspaces, and energy-efficient air-cooling systems that ensure comfort even in peak summers.

Hailed as the most ambitious interior design showroom in the country, and spread across 100,000 sq.ft., it is the size of almost two football fields. At the launch, guests sipped Veuve Clicquot Champagne while admiring wares from Milan’s haute design gallery Nilufer, Vikram Goyal’s museum-worthy brass creations, and whole rooms devoted to bespoke Italian-designed kitchens, bathrooms, home spas and furniture from Europe and the Far East. In a city where fancy store openings happen on an almost weekly basis, it was, by far, the grandest, buzziest opening party. “This is easily India’s most luxury-focused retail concept,” says Greg Foster, artistic director at Jaipur Rugs and former editor ofArchitectural DigestIndia. “To have designs from Nilufar, one of the world’s most important galleries, alongside fabrics from some of the most prestigious European textile houses, fabulous carpets from Jaipur Rugs, certified Indian antiquities from Natesan’s [and more], all under one roof, would be a fabulous concept anywhere in the world, let alone in Worli.” Greg Foster Foster recalls how the debut collection of art works shown by Sabyasachi’s Art Foundation — a series of female forms by artist Atish Mukherjee, in a contemporary take on the Bengal School of Art — were sold out on opening day. The prices ranged from ₹13.5 lakh to ₹52 lakh, and “people were fighting to buy them”, he shares. India is experiencing a retail boom, and luxury consumers are increasingly spoilt for choice as a proliferation of high-end, museum-esque stores are opening across the country.

In 1973, on the moors of the world’s malt whisky capital — Dufftown in Scotland’s Speyside region — William Grant & Sons had assigned a special task to European oak cask number 8720 at The Balvenie distillery. It was destined to patiently house a potion for 50 long years. Though this time, the elixir, comprising just barley, yeast and water, mutated into a potent potion; it absorbed the oaky interactions with the cask that honed its texture, tone and taste. Some of it evaporated, but what remained has stood the test of time and has been titled the 125-year-old brand’s rarest whisky offerings: The Balvenie Fifty – First Edition, limited to just 125 bottles.

The studio at Indiranagar pays homage to Indian craftsmanship, showcasing handpicked pieces from artisans hailing from different states. Whether you are an art connoisseur or just a curious visitor, the Bengaluru studio offers an immersive experience into India’s diverse culture. Some of the standout pieces include refurbished teakwood cinema chairs, Naga tribal panels and planters, handcrafted traditional pillars, and elemental stone lamps. While each installation tells a tale of the region it comes from, and the materials are traditional, they can easily find their place in a modern Indian household. “The pieces you find here are timeless, the idea is to use them in a more contemporary manner,” says Mansi Joshee, co-founder of KhojCrafts. Talking about curating each piece, Mansi says, “Each creation should be a piece, which we believe has a story to tell, showcasing a certain type of craft, and also how we see it fitting into a contemporary household.” A Dhokra metal craft lamp with shade of block print fabric from Rajasthan at KhojCrafts, Indiranagar.

Or needed to, with the Blinkits, Instamarts, and Amazons delivering everything to your doorstep? But despite the digital convenience, luxury retail is enticing people to step into physical spaces by evolving beyond transactions into sensory, immersive experiences — part atelier, part theatre, part shrine to tradition. “It’s all about immersion. Today’s consumer wants spaces that reveal the ‘why’ behind what they’re taking home,” says Astha Khetan, co-founder of The House of Things. Once an esteemed online platform, the brand, as of March 2025, boasts a 25,000 sq.ft. concept store in Udaipur. Here, immersive vignettes and a thoughtfully curated spatial programme invite visitors to slow down and savour the store — from celebrating the richness ofpichwaipaintings to hands-on engagement with a tactile material library that includes everything from bone inlay to textural wallpapers. Astha Khetan with The House of Things’ guest curator Feroze Gujral The mission of highlighting quality craftsmanship and elevated design through experiential retail first bloomed in high-end, exclusive pockets: New Delhi’s Dhan Mill, once a warehouse hub dating back to 1978 and now a symbol of luxury boasting over 65 curated boutiques; Jaipur’s trendy C Scheme and Civil Lines; and South Mumbai’s Kala Ghoda, which saw entrants such as Tarun Tahliani’s Ensemble as early as the 1990s. What once remained confined to these rarefied spaces is fast becoming a mainstream retail strategy, with brands across price points and across the country embracing strategic brand storytelling. Every larger-than-life flagship helmed by designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee in cities such as Mumbai, Kolkata, New Delhi, and Hyderabad is a maximalist performance — much like his clothes and jewellery.

1985,2025,The Hindu,1985,"Swiss watchmakers embrace high jewellery and vibrant dials at Watches and Wonders 2025 The luxury watch industry is on a sticky wicket. After two years of stupendous global sales growth backed by post-COVID revenge shopping, the industry fell back a bit last year — approximately 3% by sales revenue and almost 10% by units sold. Clearly, brands are selling more expensive products and increasing prices. Watch prices over the past three years have outperformed even some of the stock markets. Now that premiums have corrected to some extent from the post pandemic highs, the key concerns facing the industry remain: a persistently strong Swiss franc, and President Trump’s sudden announcement (during the fair) to raise tariffs to 31% on Swiss import — sending the luxury sector into a tizzy. The US has not only been the biggest market for luxury watches, it has also delivered excellent growth over the past three years. No wonder, the industry is worried. Oyster Perpetual Datejust 31

More gold and precious metals. More high jewellery paired with fine watchmaking. Another trend I observed was the increased use of colour and art on dials. The dominant case size remained around 38-40 mm dials, a trend we have been witnessing since 2022. No more solid black, white or greys, no chunkier 46-48 mm watches. What was missing this year, however, was any significant technical breakthrough in watch movements. I saw so many gold case and bracelet watches, that they seemed to outnumber the stainless steel watches, — at least in the central area of Palexpo where the big brands exhibit.

The travelling exhibition has made its way to Chennai, showcasing horological evolution through a collection of vintage timepieces. This travelling showcase is not just about watches; it is a rare glimpse into the mechanics of time itself — how it has been measured, worn, and redefined.

Each set features a series of 17 Breitling watches that represent key moments of the brand’s heritage.

It had its highs and lows, but every time I was low, I rose again stronger,” says jewellery designer Farah Khan Ali. Over the past two decades, Farah has carved out her own space in the world of fine jewellery, redefining what it means to design with soul with her two brands — Farah Khan Fine Jewellery and Farah Khan Atelier. Last week, we caught up with her in Chennai, where she showcased her contemporary collections — Miracle, Aayat, Amaira, Gemspire, and Sca-Ra — each inspired by geometry and symbolism. “At 22, I had no intention of being a jewellery designer, but I was extremely artistic as a child. So, when a friend suggested we take a course together, I thought it was an artistic course, but it turned out to be gemology — a scientific study of gemstones, minerals, and their properties,” she recalls. After completing her gemology course, she enrolled for jewellery designing. “I fell in love with it because it came so naturally to me; creating beautiful pieces of jewellery from nothing, just your imagination made me feel on top of the world.” Starting her career in 1993, she began interning with established jewellers, like Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri, Anmol Jewellers, Mahesh Notandass, and AKM Mehrasons Jewellers. “I realised, at that point, the concept of a jewellery designer did not exist. People were mainly working with babus and in-house designers, and because I came from a family that has been associated with Bollywood, there was curiosity — why wasn’t I acting? In a way, I glamorised the profession. For me, jewellery became not just a product, it became a piece of art because I was making things that were going to outlive their wearer and go down generations,” Farah shares. For Farah, her collections draw heavily from Nature, spirituality and storytelling. “With the Miracle collection, I wanted to remind people that it is a miracle to be alive.

1992,2025,The Hindu,1992,"The return of the everyday rebel: Skoda Octavia RS first drive The Skoda Octavia RS has for long been a cult hero among driving  enthusiasts — the kind of car that sits in that rare space between everyday practicality and pure, unfiltered driving pleasure. It is not just about outright numbers or loud styling; it is also about balance, poise, and the satisfaction that comes from a machine that feels like it was built by people who care about how it drives. And now, the legend returns  — sharper, quicker, and more focused than ever. We got behind the wheel at the Buddh International Circuit and on a technical handling course to find out if the new RS still has that magic, and it didn’t take long for the grin to set in. The first thing that strikes  you is just how responsive it feels. The 2.0-litre turbocharged TSI petrol engine delivers a muscular 195 kW of power and 370 Nm of torque, sent to the front wheels through a seven-speed dual-clutch DSG. This is the most powerful Octavia ever built, and it shows. The throttle response is instant, the gearbox perfectly intuitive, and the RS surges forward with a kind of muscular ease that makes it effortlessly fast.

He defines the experience of rolling through the Himalayas as fulfilling and Team Firefox’s conduct of the event (November 1-10) as impeccable, particularly the massive resources ploughed in to cushion the edges. And in this state of elation, Ranjit has taken a calculated decision not to reprise the effort that begot him this enriching experience and recognition. Because “it is too tough on the system”.

But towering above them all, both in stature and presence , is the GLS. Long referred to as the “S-Class of SUVs,” it represents the pinnacle of Mercedes-Benz’s sport utility lineup — a blend of technology, space, and refinement that’s hard to rival.

It is sharper to look at, smarter inside, and even more comfortable to be driven in. With AMG styling elements, a robust diesel heart, a cabin steeped in tech, and a second-row experience fit for executives, the GLS aims squarely at those who value time, space, and silence over the thrill of driving fast. The GLS commands attention the moment it appears in your rear-view mirror. Stretching over 5.2 metres in length, it’s longer than many pickup trucks, yet Mercedes has shaped it with remarkable elegance. The proportions are balanced, the lines clean, and the stance imposing without ever feeling ungainly.

It looks and behaves like something far more grown up — and that is entirely by design. Hyundai has re-engineered and redesigned it to be taller, wider, and longer in wheelbase, giving it a stronger, more confident stance that is reminiscent of the Creta. The design is bold and assertive, dominated by Hyundai’s parametric grille, horizon-style LED DRLs, and connected LED tail lamps. There is a sense of substance now, a hint of SUV maturity that the old Venue never quite managed to pull off. Even the N Line variant doubles down on that image, with red accents, R17 alloys, and twin-tip exhausts that lend it a sportier, more dynamic personality. Inside, Hyundai has truly raised the bar. The cabin feels richer, more layered, and clearly built to impress. The twin 12.3-inch curved panoramic displays immediately dominates the dashboard  — one for  the instrument cluster and the other for the infotainment hub, both powered by Hyundai’s NVIDIA-based ccNC system. It is fast, slick, and visually stunning. The materials, too, are mostly excellent, from the soft-touch panels to the leatherette upholstery and ambient lighting. The Bose sound system, wireless smartphone connectivity, and voice-enabled sunroof all contribute to a cabin experience that feels one step ahead of its class. Twin 12.3-inch curved displays and premium materials give the cabin a distinctly upmarket vibe.

VLF — short for Velocifero — is an Italian outfit making its India debut with the Mobster 135, a petrol-powered scooter that’s trying to carve out space in one of the toughest two-wheeler markets on the planet. It arrives with sharp styling, a solid spec sheet, and plenty of tech designed  to catch the eye of younger riders looking for something out of the ordinary. Available in four vibrant shades, the Mobster 135 makes a strong first impression in India’s competitive scooter market.

                                Special Arrangement Designed by Alessandro Tartarini, the Mobster 135 wears its streetfighter inspiration  with pride. Its stance is low and aggressive, the bodywork muscular, and the surfaces angular — far removed from the rounded, family-friendly look that defines most Indian scooters. The Mobster comes in four bold shades  — Crimson Override, Ash Circuit, Ghostlight, and Neon Venom — all of which play up its youthful, urban appeal. The Mobster 135 is Powered by  a liquid-cooled 125 cc engine that produces 12.1 hp and 11.7 Nm of torque. VLF claims a top speed of around 100 km/h and a mileage figure of roughly 46 km/l, making it both brisk and reasonably efficient. At 122 kg, the Mobster isn’t too heavy either, and its 155 mm of ground clearance should keep it usable in everyday Indian road  conditions. The 5-inch Bluetooth-enabled TFT display and full-LED lighting give the Mobster 135 a tech-forward edge.

1998,2025,The Hindu,1998,"How do airbags work? Testing. Testing. The auto mechanics are hard at work making sure the air-filled balloon-looking pillow-like bags work and deploy properly in this sleek and brand new car. Look at the dashboard and see how firmly the system is incorporated. But wait a minute, how does it know when to pop out and how can we make sure it doesn’t harm us? Turn on your thought wheels. Airbags have one aim - to protect those inside the car. It is a restraint system which acts to intercept. When a vehicle is met with a sudden impact, the people inside the car tend to move in a direction opposite to that of the forces of collision. This means there is high risk of critical injuries to occur. With airbags, the movement opposite to the forces is restricted and thus, the people inside the car remain relatively safe with lesser injuries. A seatbelt, also a restraint system, works with airbags to protect those inside the car. Car companies want to offer best protection with the airbags they provide in their cars. To ensure this, the airbag mechanism goes through a series of simulations and tests for different types of impact conditions. Afterall, crashes aren’t all a single type. For this the bag is prepped thoroughly. Airbags have one aim - to protect those inside the car.

Once the bag is made, they are kept folded at places in the car’s dash. As crashes happen suddenly, airbags cannot waste even a millisecond.

In the four weeks since a cut in the GST was announced, the company had received bookings of 4 lakh cars and delivered 2,50,000 cars, he said. The company’s factories are working even on Sundays to meet demand, the executive said adding the bookings at the rate of one lakh cars per week will continue till end of Diwali festival and hopefully there after, the executive said. “In the last 4 weeks, we have received 4 lakh bookings. On average every week we have received 1 lakh bookings which is the highest ever for any festival period. Another interesting fact is for our entry-level cars like Celerio, WagonR and the Alto K10, we have received close to 80,000 booking with a growth of almost 70%,” he said. “In our total retail business, which we are doing in the pre-GST period, the contribution of this entry-level car was 16.7% but post-GST now, that has moved to 22.2%. There is a huge jump in the contribution of these entry-level cars, and what we are seeing in our showroom is that plenty of helmets are now there on our discussion tables in our showroom (indicating the presence of two-wheeler owners),” he said. “So a new set of customers are coming in two-wheelers and they are booking the entry level cars and in this 4-week period we have already retailed close to 2,50,000 vehicles which is highest ever for any festival period,” he said He said car penetration will only increase when two-wheelers owner start upgrading to four wheelers. “The traction is good across all the segments but if I go by the definition of the GST 2.0 small cars mean vehicles, which are right now attracting a GST of 18%, the bookings and the growth is much higher compared with the vehicles which fall in ",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/business/maruti-suzuki-gets-1-lakh-bookings-a-week-led-by-small-car-sales/article70163692.ece
2000,2025,The Hindu,2000,"Yamaha charts its next chapter: Two launches, two unveils, and a step beyond the niche While Yamaha has enjoyed consistent success in the premium commuter and 150cc segments, it has long carried an image of being slightly out of reach for the average buyer — aspirational, but not always accessible. With this new mix of launches and EV unveils, the brand appears to be steering toward that elusive middle ground: offering excitement and style, while also addressing broader appeal. XSR155: Retro with relevance The XSR155 marks the arrival of Yamaha’s global “Modern Retro Sport” design philosophy in India — a blend of old-school charm with current-day performance. The design pays homage to classic roadsters with its circular LED headlamp, teardrop tank, and a clean rear section, while underneath it all lies familiar modern hardware. Power comes from a 155cc liquid-cooled, four-valve engine with Variable Valve Actuation, putting out 13.5 kW and 14.2 Nm of torque. It sits on a Deltabox frame, paired with USD forks and a Monocross rear suspension, ensuring that the handling feels sharp and predictable. Dual-channel ABS, traction control, and a 6-speed gearbox with assist and slipper clutch round out the feature list. It’s clear that Yamaha hasn’t skimped on equipment or engineering. The question is whether this kind of motorcycle — stylish, capable, but premium — can find significant traction beyond enthusiasts and urban buyers. Offered in four colour options with Scrambler and Café Racer accessory packs, the XSR155 is priced at ₹1,49,990 (ex-showroom, Delhi). FZ-RAVE: A familiar formula, refreshed FZ-Rave

2001,2025,The Hindu,2001,"2025 Mahindra Thar SUV Review: Improved comfort, iconic design, off-road capability Since its relaunch in 2020, the Mahindra Thar has grown beyond being just an SUV. It has become a cultural statement — a symbol of freedom, exploration, and individuality. Yet, for all its charm, customers were quick to point out that it wasn’t the easiest vehicle to live with on a daily basis. Mahindra has been listening, and the 2025 Thar arrives as the most practical and well-rounded version yet, without compromising on the rugged DNA that made it such a success. Visually, Mahindra hasn’t tampered with the formula too much. The Thar retains its classic, boxy silhouette but gains a few tweaks that elevate its presence. A  new front grille now blends neatly with a dual-tone bumper, while R18 alloy wheels add a touch of sophistication. Two fresh colours join the palette — Tango Red and Battleship Grey — ensuring the Thar stands out even in a sea of SUVs. Inside, the black-themed dashboard feels more premium, and a redesigned steering wheel adds a contemporary edge. These are small touches, but they go a long way in refreshing the cabin’s look and feel. With petrol and diesel options, manual or automatic transmissions, and RWD or 4x4 configurations, the Thar suits both city drives and off-road adventures.

2002,2025,The Hindu,2002,"Ducati Streetfighter V4: The naked Panigale evolves The new Streetfighter V4 continues to trace its lineage directly to the Panigale V4, but this time the resemblance goes far beyond skin deep. At its core lies the same 1,103cc Desmosedici Stradale engine, developed  from Ducati’s MotoGP program, producing  214 hp at 13,500 rpm and 12.2 kgm of torque at 11,250 rpm, all within  Euro5+ compliant trim. It is  an engine  built  for uncompromising  performance, yet refined  to deliver precise control on real-world rads.  The counter-rotating crankshaft and Twin Pulse firing order give it that signature Ducati pulse, and for those who live for track days, an optional Akrapovič exhaust bumps output to 226 hp. Even so, this is not  a motorcycle that has  been softened for the streets—it is  one that has  been meticulously re-engineered to make the most of both worlds. Visually, the Streetfighter V4 remains one of the most striking naked machines on the planet. Its aggressive stance is defined by the low LED headlamp unit flanked by integrated biplane wings that now generate up to 17 kg of downforce at 270 km/h. The overall proportions have been refined,  with the front appearing more planted and the tail sleeker. The sculpted 16-litre aluminium tank, narrow at the waist and broad-shouldered up top, gives the rider more room to move under braking or while cornering. Even the new double-sided Hollow Symmetrical Swingarm contributes not only to improved traction but also to the Streetfighter’s distinctive visual drama. It is  unmistakably a Ducati — raw, mechanical, and beautifully put together. From its counter-rotating crankshaft to the Öhlins Smart EC 3.0 suspension, every detail of the Streetfighter V4 is engineered to deliver pure Ducati exhilaration—on road or track.

                                Special Arrangement We drove the new MINI Countryman JCW at the Buddh International Circuit, and the first impression is clear — this is the most powerful MINI yet. Under the hood lies a 2.0-litre twin-turbo petrol engine that delivers 300 hp and 400 Nm of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission and MINI’s ALL4 all-wheel-drive system. The result is a car that feels planted and alive through every corner, capable of sprinting from 0–100 km/h in just 5.4 seconds, on to a top speed of 250 km/h. The steering is precise, body control is tight, and the chassis balance is exceptional for something that rides 190 mm off the ground. Through BIC’s long, sweeping bends, it corners with composure that’s right up there with sportscar benchmarks — and the quad exhausts ensure you’re constantly rewarded with a throaty, mechanical soundtrack. The Countryman JCW offers multiple drive modes, allowing drivers to tailor its character from relaxed cruising to all-out attack at the flick of a switch. Each mode tweaks throttle response, steering weight, and gearbox behaviour, giving it genuine duality — a commuter on weekdays and a track toy on weekends.

At the core of the G 450d lies a 3.0-litre inline six-cylinder diesel engine paired with a 48V mild hybrid system. The engine delivers  270 kW (362 hp) and an immense 750 Nm of torque, with an additional 15 kW of electric boost available via the integrated starter generator. The result is effortless acceleration — 0 to 100 km/h comes up in just 5.8 seconds — and a top speed of 210 km/h. Despite its formidable size and weight, performance is brisk, and refinement remains exemplary, typical of Mercedes-Benz’s latest generation diesel units. With 241 mm ground clearance, approach and departure angles of 31° and 30°, and differential locks, the G 450d tackles challenging terrain with ease.

Over a 100-kilometre ride through these unpredictable conditions, one thing became clear — the TVS Apache RTX isn’t just another entrant in the adventure segment. It’s a motorcycle built to make adventure riding accessible, enjoyable, and refreshingly unpretentious. At first glance, the Apache RTX commands attention. .

Inside, Mahindra has focused on comfort and usability with newly contoured seats, leatherette upholstery, a 17.8 cm touchscreen infotainment system, and steering-mounted audio controls. RideFlo technology — Mahindra’s latest ride and handling setup — promises marginal improvements in comfort and stability, though the Bolero still feels very much like the tough, body-on-frame SUV it’s always been.

Inspired by the legendary Nissan Patrol, it features muscular proportions, bold C-shaped LED lights, and thoughtful design touches rooted in Indian adventure. Positioned as a disruptor, the Tekton signals Nissan’s comeback in India with premium craftsmanship and strong performance. Nissan India needs a win. For the longest time, the brand has kept itself in the game with a one-product strategy — the Magnite. And while that compact SUV has done well to sustain momentum, Nissan’s ambitions clearly stretch beyond survival. The company isn’t stepping back; it’s gearing up. And the All-New Tekton could be the spark that reignites Nissan’s story in India. Set to debut in 2026, the Tekton represents the next phase of Nissan’s “One Car, One World” strategy — a philosophy that aims to create globally relevant products rooted in local strength. It is the kind of SUV designed to help Nissan reclaim its place in the mainstream and remind buyers what the brand is capable of when it brings its A-game. On paper, the Tekton has the makings of a true game changer — one that could finally give Nissan the traction it’s been looking for. The name Tekton comes from the Greek word for “craftsman” or “architect,” and that’s a fitting metaphor for where Nissan finds itself today — rebuilding, refining, and reimagining its identity. The name conveys precision, purpose, and  confidence in craftmanship. It’s about shaping something with intent — much like what Nissan is attempting to do with its Indian journey.

No hands, no feet, not a corporeal human presence needed. Let’s begin our exploration. Humans and digital technology go way back. Humans and vehicles go even further back. Behold now, this relationship is so at peak that vehicles can handle digital technology smoothly than its master drivers. The invention of the autonomous vehicles (AVs) technology marks a pivotal point in the trajectory of the automobile and transport conglomerate. Every new invention in the technological field of vision, especially those that seem utopian into-the-future, are deemed a sophisticated fancy; modern and romantic in nature. Same goes for AVs. An easier adjective for these vehicles is ‘self-driving’ which is quite apt for how it presents itself. An autonomous vehicle is one that can drive without assistance from the driver. Yet, how do these vehicles “self-drive”? They clearly aren’t advanced robots from Cybertron. Driverless vehicles work effectively due to the fact that they can see. Sounds like some fantasy come true, doesn’t it? What actually is meant here is that there are many radars and sensors installed within the vehicle that can detect and ‘see’ what’s going on around it. In a Waymo car (a self-driving car by Waymo LLC), there are LiDar sensors which the car heavily depends upon to see. LiDar is essentially light detection and ranging where data collected creates a 3D map of environments for the vehicle. The picture of the Waymo here shows you the roof-mounted LiDar sensors. Since an active vehicle means it’s on the move, its environment will change every second. It’s crucial for AVs that they constantly and constantly monitor the data that is fed to them. The cameras, the LiDar sensors, radars - all provide data of what’s happening on the road.

Then the return trip a few years later, again over a week, because I had to take the motorcycle back and my stress-related backaches disappeared magically. Bikers at the event And then the big one. Rajasthan during Demonetisation. Udaipur to Jaipur to Pokhran to Jaisalmer and back to Udaipur in three days — 1,600 kilometres riding along potholes and trenches, enough trauma to make me promise myself I would never swing a leg over a motorcycle again. Yet here I was, walking out of the North Goa airport, excited like it was my first time. Three days for the love of all things motorcycling. The Motoverse (November 21-23). On arrival, the folks at Royal Enfield handed me the key to a Hunter 350 the night before — 11 litres in the tank to explore Goa during the Motoverse. The perfect Goa bike. Whether I was dodging potholes or slicing through them, the suspension took most of the brunt. Compact, nimble, easy to flick through traffic. I was all set. A drone shot of the event It is not every day you see rapper Hanumankind gloving up like a prizefighter before mounting a bike. From Garage Café, he led a pack of riders up to Vagator Hilltop, the venue for what would become three days of controlled chaos.

2010,2025,The Hindu,2010,"Numeros Launches ‘n - First’: A Hybrid Between Bike and Scooter for Urban Riders The design  strays from conventional scooter proportions, featuring larger 16-inch wheels that promise better stability, paired with a low step-through frame for ease of use. Developed in collaboration with Italian design studio Wheelab, the n - First attempts to combine European aesthetics with Indian practicality — a balance that could appeal to urban riders seeking something different from the usual crop of electric scooters. Underneath the design, the n - First is powered by a PMSM mid-drive motor with chain transmission and comes in two battery configurations: 2.5 kWh and 3 kWh. Numeros claims a certified range of up to 109 km (IDC) on the top variant and 91 km on the lower versions. Charging time ranges between five and eight hours, depending on the model. While these numbers place it among other mid-range EVs in the market, real-world performance and battery durability will be crucial factors for long-term acceptance. Where Numeros has tried to differentiate itself is in durability and smart features. The company says the n - First has undergone extensive testing in diverse conditions — from Rajasthan’s heat to Himachal’s cold — to ensure reliability. The scooter is also equipped with IoT-based connectivity features such as theft alerts, remote locking, live location tracking, geo-fencing, and ride analytics through a dedicated mobile app. While the hardware and feature list are in line with what one might expect from an emerging EV brand, Numeros’ biggest challenge lies elsewhere — consumer trust. Despite being around for five years, Numeros remains a small player in a market increasingly crowded with both established manufacturers and aggressive startups. Its earlier model, the Diplos Max+, launched just a couple of months ago, focused on commercial users, giving the brand some visibility but not yet the recognition that drives mainstream adoption. The n - First seems like an attempt to change that narrative by appealing to a wider audience.

2011,2025,The Hindu,2011,"Royal Enfield Bullet 650: A new chapter for an unbroken legend The arrival of the Bullet 650 marks  a rare moment in motorcycling: a pivot without reinvention, a leap forward without abandoning the familiar silhouette generations have grown up with.  The Bullet is not  just another retro-themed motorcycle; it holds the distinction of being the longest-running production motorcycle in existence, with a lineage that stretches unbroken all the way back to 1932. Few machines in the world can claim such uninterrupted lineage, and even fewer can evolve without losing the essence that made them historic in the first place. Its first public outing in India at Motoverse 2025 sparked understandable excitement,  yet, the motorcycle itself stays rooted  in the design language that has defined the Bullet for more than  nine decades. Royal Enfield’s intention is unmistakable: this is not  a reinvention—it is  a respectful continuation of a motorcycle whose identity has become timeless through restraint and relevance rather than constant reinvention. At first glance, the motorcycle  feels instantly familiar.  The long, uninterrupted tank line, the upright stance, the weighty metal construction, and the visual simplicity all reaffirm its lineage. But take a moment to observe and the evolution reveals itself. The 650 twin nestles within a steel spine frame, giving the motorcycle a more planted, muscular profile. The casquette headlamp housing returns, now with an LED setup, supported by the nostalgic “tiger-eye” pilot lamps that anchor the front end. The wider bench seat, the taller handlebar, and the mature stance make the motorcycle feel more regal—almost as if the Bullet has finally grown into the image it has projected for generations. The Bullet 650’s familiar stance is elevated by subtle design updates, from the casquette headlamp to the wider bench seat.| Photo Credit:

2012,2025,The Hindu,2012,"Tata Sierra returns to rewrite the mid-size SUV order Few nameplates in India command the kind of nostalgic admiration the Tata Sierra enjoys. When it arrived in 1991, it did not merely expand Tata’s lineup—it became a cultural marker.  Its distinctive  silhouette and unconventional design made it an object of aspiration at a time when the Indian automotive market was still finding its footing.  Now, more than three decades later and after a 23-year hiatus, the Sierra returns in a completely reimagined avatar. Launched in Mumbai, the all-new Sierra stands as Tata Motors’ boldest attempt yet to elevate the mid-size SUV segment and challenge the status quo. From thievery first glance, it is evident that Tata is not aiming to blend in The new Sierra is positioned as a statement—an SUV created to stand out, push boundaries and offer buyers a richer, more expressive experience than the safe, predictable options that have long dominated the segment. The modern Sierra retains the soul of the original while reinventing itself for a new generation. Where the first model was celebrated for its distinctive stance and individuality, the new Sierra builds on those traits with a contemporary, award-winning design that has already garnered global recognition. Upright posture, squared-off geometry, and sculpted surfaces give it a powerful visual signature, blending nostalgia with a premium, forward-looking aesthetic. Equipped with Level 2+ ADAS and proven crashworthiness, the Sierra prioritises occupant protection without compromise

Pet dog owners in GCC areas are advised to have their dogs get vaccinated with the anti-rabies vaccine and microchipped. Then, the owners must proceed to apply for a licenceonline through a designated portal, paying an annual fee of ₹50 per pet along with submission of vaccination proof. While microchipping for cats is optional, vaccinations are conducted at clinics prior to the online registration process. The provision of free services like microchipping and vaccination for the pets is available at the veterinary clinics in Thiru Vi Ka Nagar, Nungambakkam, Kannammapet, Meenambakkam, Pulianthope, and Llyods Colony from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. on all days of the week, including Sundays. The owners need to provide their name and phone number at the clinic to have their pets vaccinated and microchipped. “Yes, microchipping is safe and it is recommended for all companion dogs regardless of breed and size. An ideal age for microchipping a puppy would be at eight weeks,” explained Samaran Thamarai, Humane Education Officer at Blue Cross of India. After December 7, the authorities will conduct a door-to-door inspection. The primary fine of ₹5000 will be imposed for each unlicensed pet discovered. The GCC designated clinics offer free vaccinations for pet owners, including other areas. However, microchipping is restricted only to pets from GCC areas.

Former Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac and KIIFB Chief Executive Officer K.M. Abraham have also received show-cause notices from the ED. The ED said it has issued show-cause notices to the Chief Minister, Mr. Isaac and Mr. Abraham on November 12 for the contravention of FEMA provisions and master direction of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) “by the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) and its authorities” amounting to ₹466.91 crore. The notices, issued by Rajnish Dev Burman, Adjudicating Authority, Special Director, ED, are related to adjudication proceedings under FEMA. According to the notices, the charge is that ₹466.91 crore – which is part of the funds raised through rupee-denominated bonds (masala bonds) – was used to purchase land. This action was “specifically prohibited” and was in contravention of the RBI master direction dated June 1, 2018, according to the ED. KIIFB, a body corporate developed by the Kerala government for mobilising funds for infrastructure development, had floated ‘masala bond’ in the London Stock Exchange and the Singapore stock exchange to raise funds to the tune of ₹2,672.8 crore under external commercial borrowing (ECB). According to the notices, the Chief Minister, Dr. Isaac or Mr. Abraham are not required to appear in person. The CPI(M) has attributed the ED notices to “a political ploy of the BJP during election time” in Kerala. Responding to the notices, Dr. Isaac, who was Finance Minister when the bond was floated, described these as “politically motivated” and a “smokescreen.” He said the ED has been “regular” in issuing such notices on the “masala bond issue” ahead of elections in Kerala.

2016,2025,The Hindu,2016,"Crushed stones beneath our railway tracks? Why? Clinkety-clack. Clinkety clack. The train has left the station. What remains is the solitary railway track. Oh wait, the track is not alone. The track sleeps on the stone bed. I know where your mind went. No. The stones underneath the railway tracks are not simply ballast. They are part of it. The concept of ballast owes itself to the ships. The idea of stabilizing mammoth ships on oceans gave rise to ballast. When modern railways were underway in England, the gravel ballast from ships was used to support the railway roadbeds (roadbed is the entire foundation for the railway track). Ballast is not exclusively stones. They can be any material placed at the bottom to provide stability to the vessel. Track ballast keeps the tracks in place and supports the full weight of the trains when they move over it. For railways, construction of the roadbed is crucial. The roadbed alone cannot withstand the pressure from the weighty moving train. A loaded passenger train weighs an average of about 1100 tonnes (that’s like 250 elephants altogether!). To alleviate, a layer of crushed stones becomes ballast over the roadbed. Let’s understand the diagram here. It shows sections of railway roadbeds along with tracks. Dimensioned cross-sections of two roadbed and tracks situations: one with gravel ballast, and another with stone ballast.

Before spreading out the stones, the roadbed surface is prepared such that water drains over to the sides. If you remove the layer of ballast, you’ll see that the roadbed is crowned in shape. Over the ballast, railway sleepers (the thick rectangular support tie that lies perpendicular to the track) are distributed. With the steel track laid, the work is done. The thickness of the ballast layer ranges from anywhere between 150mm (minimum) to 300 or even 40",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/children/crushed-stones-beneath-our-railway-tracks-why/article70166447.ece

There is no such thing as too much research. 2. You cannot and should not plan a strict itinerary. And 3. Something almost always goes wrong.

She stayed for two weeks with a college friend in Civil Lines — cycling to cafés like Curious Life and Tapri Tea House, sketching the peeling façades along MI Road, and wandering through Johri Bazaar on languid afternoons. “Jaipur taught me that slowing down doesn’t mean being idle,” she says. “It means noticing the textures of a place.” At Aramness Gir in Gujarat, where she spent four days in late November last year, she learnt stillness. Mornings began with soft safaris through dew-drenched scrub; afternoons were for reading by the pool. Evenings ended with a sattvic thali beneath the stars — simple millets, leafy greens and buttermilk — eaten in silence under lantern light, phones left behind in the room. “That quiet was uncomfortable at first,” she admits, “but it’s the kind that rearranges your thoughts.” Her most recent pause was at The Postcard Mandalay Hall in Fort Kochi in March. Days slipped by easily — sketching at Qissa Café, watching the fishermen at the Chinese nets before dusk, and catching Kathakali rehearsals at Greenix Village. “It’s the in-between moments I travel for,” she smiles. “Slow travel doesn’t change your life overnight — it seeps in, quietly, like tidewater.” Salvita is not alone. Many millennials and Gen Z travellers now value presence over itineraries, preferring tofeela place rather than conquer it. “You shouldn’t come back from a holiday exhausted,” she says.

I am strapped into the paramotor harness, the sand still cool beneath my feet, when the wing catches the first clean gust. The engine steadies, the beach slips backward and in a few seconds I am gliding above the water as the coastline shimmers  below me. The view feels immediate and unreal at the same time, as if the day is unfolding all at once from 400 feet above the sea. Vihang Adventures, in association with Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC), is offering this experience every day through its paramotoring operations at Rushikonda and Sagarnagar beachfront. The activity was formally introduced on November 15 in the presence of APTDC Chairman N Balaji. Since then, the early morning and late evening rides have already become  sought-after slots, largely because these flights allow passengers to watch sunlight shift across the coastline while paramotoring steadily at about 400 to 500 feet above sea level. The rides cover an aerial radius of approximately five to six kilometres for riders to see long, unbroken stretches of the beach, rocky hillocks and the gradual turn of the sea towards the harbour. According to Surya Teja, the lead pilot and one of the driving forces behind the project, the team currently manages around 30 flights a day, with a plan to increase capacity in the coming days. He explains that the long-term goal is to reach a 100 rides per day. “We are also preparing to introduce Jeep parasailing and jet skiing so that visitors may plan entire adventure itineraries,” says Surya.

2023,2025,The Hindu,2023,"How an island in Norway defied time: Welcome to Sommarøy Imagine a place where the sun never sets for months, and time almost seems to stand still. Welcome to Sommarøy, a tiny island in Norway. What looks like a scene straight out of a dream, this small island and its old fishing village in the Arctic feel like a different world—one without the usual boundaries of time. Sommarøy is a small island located above the Arctic Circle, surrounded by sparkling blue waters and rugged, scenic landscapes. Snow-capped mountains, white sandy beaches, and crystal-clear fjords make it look like a place from a storybook. The island is home to a tight-knit community of locals who have lived here for generations. Most make their living from fishing, harvesting the sea’s bounty, and working closely with nature. Life here is simple and closely connected to the rhythms of the land and sea, giving the island its unique charm. What makes Sommarøy truly special is how its residents chose to live without strict schedules. With the sun shining for almost 24 hours in summer, clocks seemed less important. Locals follow the natural rhythm of day and night instead of fixed hours. Fishing, and daily chores happen when it feels right, not according to the clock. Imagine wanting to swim or having coffee at 2 a.m.—on Sommarøy, that’s perfectly normal because time doesn’t feel like it matters. People spend long evenings on the beach, go for hikes, or simply enjoy time with family and friends. Life here flows at its own pace, showing that sometimes, nature can be the best guide for how we live. Sommarøy’s unusual lifestyle is shaped by the Arctic’s natural wonders. On the island, the sun does not set from 18 May to 26 July, a full 69 days of continuous daylight—this is the famous Midnight Sun. Imagine playing on the beach or going fishing while the sky stays bright at midnight! In winter, the opposite happens. The island experiences the Polar Night, when the sun barely rises for weeks.

When inVaranasi, do as the Gods do. At this historic city, which brings to life many history and spiritual lessons, you can now stay in ancestral homes to soak in the quintessential Banaras experience. What strikes you as you walk in to juSTa Kashi Parampara, located just 800 metres from the iconic Assi Ghat, is not just the handcrafted wooden pillars evoking a sense of strolling into ahaveli, the sandstonejaaliwork and the artwork that adorns its corridors, but also the central courtyard – a standard feature in most traditional Indian homes. At Kashi Parampara, this courtyard not only provides an abundance of natural light but also serves as a stage for art and culture. It was also once a free clinic – since the property was bought more than 80 years ago by the grandfather of the current owner, Manish Dwivedi. “As he was an eminent doctor, he used to run a free clinic for the neighbourhood. My grandmother, a disciple of Girija Devi and a member of the Banaras Gharana, filled the home – and this courtyard – withbhaitaks(an intimate, small audience performance) and held many conversations on art, culture and music. In fact, we used to have several students of music and scholars stay at this residence, and spend hours discussing culture and music,” recalls Manish. Today, the same 80-year-old ancestral home has been converted into a hotel, welcomes guests from across the country and abroad with a traditionalaarthiwelcome – a pujari reciting mantras – that prepare you to soak into true Banaras spirit.

The incident is the latest in a series of data leaks at major South Korean companies, including SK Telecom. The government, which held an emergency meeting on Sunday, is looking into whether Coupang violated safety rules regarding personal information protection, said Minister of Science and ICT Bae Kyung-hoon. Coupang said on Saturday that it learned of the data breach on November 18 and reported it to authorities. It said it was working with law enforcement and regulatory authorities. The company, whose services are ubiquitous for many Koreans using its “Rocket” fast deliveries, has said it had 24.7 million active commercial users in the third quarter. Yonhap News Agency reported on Sunday that a Chinese former employee at Coupang was suspected of being behind the breach. Coupang sent a complaint to police this month, and police are investigating, Yonhap said, without citing the sources of its information. Coupang could not immediately be reached for comment outside business hours. The breach exposed customers’ names, email addresses, phone numbers, shipping addresses and certain order histories but not payment details or login credentials, Coupang said.

As we get ready to explore the heritage site, our guide pauses to take another call from a school seeking to schedule a visit for another group of students. “We get a lot of enquiries from schools,” she tells us. For the unversed, Ras Al Khaimah is UAE’s lesser known getaway where visitors can soak in adventure, history and culture at a leisurely pace, unlike the glitz and glamour ofDubai, Abu Dhabi or Sharjah. Now on the UNESCO World Heritage Cultural Tentative List (a tentative list is a preliminary inventory of a country’s cultural and natural sites that it may want to propose for World Heritage status in future), Al Jazeera Al Hamra is one of the prime attractions for history enthusiasts. Translated from Arabic, Al Jazeera Al Hamra denotes Red Island. This is said to be the last remaining pearling village in the Gulf region, the rest having been demolished since the discovery of oil. A part of the village’s ruins have been left untouched, as per UNESCO requisites, while other portions have been restored using materials such as coral stones and sandstones similar to the ones originally used by Za’ab tribes to build their homes and souks. As we walk through the alleyways filled with powdery dust, our guide shares the story of how the ancient tribes lived in the region, from the 16th Century till the late 1960s, before moving en masse to Abu Dhabi in search of livelihood and an urban lifestyle. The Al Jazeera Al Hamra settlement was established in the land of Al Qasimi, the ruling dynasty of Ras Al Khaimah.

In  2024 alone, there were 1.3 million new infections reported worldwide, with India reporting 68,450 new cases. Today, with the availability of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART), persons with HIV who have access to these medications do not become sick with AIDS, the illness caused by the HIV. Research has shown, that the life expectancy of people living with HIV who are receiving ART and are  virologically suppressed, is almost similar to persons who don’t have HIV. . This has become possible due to the scientific discoveries of several antiretroviral medications which are given in combination to persons with HIV. There are no vaccines to prevent HIV infection, but with the discovery oflenacapavir, a new, long-acting injectable antiviral medicine, HIV can today be prevented if lenacapavir is given twice a year as  pre- exposure prophylaxis(PrEP). This is  exciting news for  an infection that has no cure. A UNAIDS report shows that at the end of 2025, just before asudden collapse in global fundingtriggered a crisis in the global AIDS response, the remarkable efforts of communities and governments had brought down the numbers of new HIV infections by 40% and of AIDS-related deaths by 56% since 2010.

2035,2025,The Hindu,2035,"Which country is closest to space? Space officially begins about 100 km above the Earth’s surface, a boundary known as the Kármán line. But Earth isn’t a perfect sphere — it’s slightly flattened at the poles and bulged at the equator. Because of this shape, the distance from the centre of the Earth to the surface isn’t the same everywhere. So, being closest to space doesn’t just depend on a mountain’s height — it also depends on where it’s located on the planet. If we went by the simple logic that the tallest mountain must be closest to the sky, the answer would be Mount Everest. But surprisingly, it’s not! Because of Earth’s shape, points near the equator are actually farther from the center of the Earth, making them closer to outer space. That’s why a mountain near the equator can be closer to space than even the tallest peak in the world! So, which country is closest to space? It’s Ecuador, home to Mount Chimborazo, a dormant volcano near the equator. Even though Mount Everest is taller above sea level, the peak of Chimborazo is actually farther from the center of the Earth. Because Earth bulges at the equator, this makes Chimborazo the closest point on Earth to outer space. If you stood on Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador, you’d be 2,000 metres closer to space than if you were standing on Mount Everest!",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/children/which-country-is-closest-to-space/article70185856.ece

As a precautionary measure, the train services between Neral and Matheran were suspended from June to October, though the shuttle services between Aman Lodge, near the hill station's entry post, and Dasturi point continued to operate, they said. Matheran, a small hill station near Mumbai that attracts a large number of tourists, receives heavy rainfall during the monsoon season. As the area has experienced landslides, track damage, and embankment washouts during past monsoons, the narrow-gauge train services are suspended as a precautionary measure. This year, services on the 21-km Neral-atheran narrow gauge line, which passes through the picturesque ghat section, were suspended from the first week of June. The services on the Neral-Matheran narrow gauge corridor will resume from November 6. Four services — two each from Neral and  Matheran — will be operated daily, the Central Railway said in a release on Tuesday. The first train for Matheran from Neral will depart at 8.50 a.m. and reach its destination at 11.30 a.m. The second train will depart at 10.25 a.m. and reach Matheran at 1.05 p.m. From Matheran, the trains will leave at 2.45 p.m. and 4 p.m. and reach Neral at 5.30 p.m. and 6.40 p.m., respectively, it said.

Now in India for the first time, he is preparing a pop-up in Puducherry that brings his classical training into conversation with local flavours he has been exploring since he arrived. Hosted by The Promenade hotel, the pop-up will bring Vila’s style of modern French cooking to Puducherry. The seven-course tasting menu, offered in vegetarian and non-vegetarian formats, reflects the precision of his classical training along with the small local influences he has begun exploring in India. “I travel a lot, and I love to mix my kitchen with the kitchen of another chef,” he says. “Here, I want to introduce French technique but also use ingredients like ghee, Pondicherry salt and Kerala pepper to bring a little of India into the menu.” Parsnips in a citrus-inspired texture and maple syrup ice cream

                                Special Arrangement The menu moves through classic French structure: hors d’oeuvres, soup, entrée, palate-cleansing sorbet, and a choice of mains before dessert. Both versions begin with a a vol-au-vent, a light, crisp pastry with filling, and salad, before splitting into a chilled vichyssoise, a leek, and potato soup for vegetarians and a Lyon-style onion soup for non-vegetarians. A cocoa tartlet layered with braised red onions, porcini and truffle forms the entrée, followed by a raspberry–kaffir lime sorbet. The mains offer two choices: Provençal vegetable tian or truffle-scented celery risotto on one side, and richer options like beef Wellington, ghee-poached sea bass or slow-cooked chicken with morels on the other. Dessert stays firmly in French territory, closing with either a spiced tarte Tatin or a mille-feuille, and finally, coffee with a small entremet.

2039,2025,The Hindu,2039,"Indian cacao farmers with craft chocolate ambitionsPremium Opening the windows of the tree house on Varanashi Organic Farms was a soothing balm. Looking out into treetops spearing the cotton-candy sky at this 100-acre family farm in Adyanadka, a village in Dakshina Kannada District, our city bones were lulled into finding their forest feet. For the next three days, we immersed ourselves in the Cacao Residency hosted by the cacao-growing farm along with Goya, a food media company, and the Indian Cacao & Craft Chocolate Festival, a five-year-old initiative that brings together the stakeholders in India’s cacao and craft chocolate ecosystem. We learnt about the evolution in farming methods and processing techniques, witnessed the making of a craft bar, and tasted a selection of small-batch chocolates. At a time when headlines are being overtaken by news of rising cocoa prices, and social media is warningconsumers to check the labelfor ‘chocolate flavouring’ — an attempt by brands to find cheaper ways to keep their products on shelves — it was interesting to walk up to the oldest cacao trees in South India. Partha Varanashi, the ninth-generation farmer of this over-200-year-old property, shares how these 65-year-old trees were brought as saplings to the farm by his late grandfather Varanashi Subraya Bhat. Numerous strains of cacao from South America and other cacao-growing countries were tried and tested for their viability and yield at the Central Plantation Crops Research Institute before settling on two hybrids. From Bhat, these saplings were distributed to other farms in the region, “and within the next five years, they were producing over 50 tonnes of cacao [sold to Cadbury]”, says Varanashi. Partha Varanashi at Varanashi Organic Farms In the mid-80s, however, “when Cadbury lowballed farmers on the price for cacao”, Bhat’s other founding venture, the farmers’ cooperative Central Arecanut and Cacao Marketing and Co-operative Society (CAMPCO), added another first.

2040,2025,The Hindu,2040,"A UNESCO honour and a culinary awakening: Lucknow rediscovers its soul through food Lucknow has officially been declared a UNESCO Creative City of Gastronomy during the 43rd Session of the UNESCO General Conference, currently underway in Uzbekistan. The recognition celebrates the city’s centuries-old Awadhi cuisine, its living food traditions, and inclusive cultural heritage. It is a fitting honour for a city where age-oldtundaykebabs are still cooked and eaten much as they were a century ago — the only change being the passing of ladles and appetites from one generation to the next. But beyond the historic lanes of Chowk, a quiet food revolution is taking shape. New restaurants are creating outward-looking dining experiences in the rapidly gentrifying pockets of Gomti Nagar, while others are reinterpreting traditional fare to give diners fresh perspectives on local cuisine.

And while kebabs, nihari, biryani and chaat form the backbone of Lucknow’s UNESCO bid, how these foods are accessed in their original establishments is unlikely to change. Yet, a growing number of Lucknowites now seek easier access to classic bazaar fare — in cleaner surroundings and without the accompanying after-effects. For years, sit-down dining options were limited to staples such as Quality, Royal Café, or Chinese favourites Jone Hing and Chung Fa. Today, diners are looking for a wider range of international flavours that still retain a sense of comfort and familiarity. Sassy Canteen, founded in 2019 in Balmiki Nagar and now operating in an expanded space, represents this shift.

And a group of ‘daughters’ from  Chug village in western Arunachal Pradesh  are changing the region’s landscape with a 12-seater fine dining heritage restaurant that is named Damu’s. The all-women’s team here curates custom menus with heirloom recipes using hyperlocal farm produce. In the last 18 months, they have helped redefine healthy eating choices for  both  locals and  tourists. But Damu’s Heritage Dine is much more than a restaurant. It is a concept in sustainability and an experience in ancient wisdom. It is the story of empowerment and identity of the Monpa tribe with a strong connection to the forests and its conservation. They live in balance with Nature, rearing their bovines  and growing their own grains (millets, barley, corn),  fruits, vegetables, spices and condiments. Each meal prepared by Damu’s women is forage-based and carries the taste and soul of the eastern Himalayas. “We only buy salt, oil and chicken from the market,” says Rinchin Jomba, the main chef at Damu’s. Living in her 150-year-old ancestral house made with wood, sturdy stones and mud, Rinchin’s life was simple like those of most women around her: Farming, weaving or doing casual labour and taking care of the families. Now, 10 of them have turned entrepreneurs managing the  restaurant out of Rinchin’s refurbished house and, many others with them now run small businesses such as homestays, paper-making (Mon shugu)units, handicraft shops and a living museum that showcases a typical Monpa tribal’s  way of life. Launched in March 2024, Damu’s, has steadily gained visibility as a sustainable tourism initiative aimed at preserving traditional architecture and reviving culinary heritage.

Cafes today are made for lingering – over endless cups of cappuccinos or matchas, working on your laptop, networking with colleagues or indulging in conversations with friends. However, back in the 1940s, there weren’t many places in the capital where one could do that. There were roadside chai shops, sure, but no organised coffee houses as such, until the United Coffee House (UCH) came up in the heart of the city in 1942. Connaught Place, at that time, was known more for its drapery and equestrian shops, and bakeries and it was up to Lala Hans Raj Kalra to see the potential for a coffee house where people could linger over cups of the hot beverage and spend hours discussing everything from politics to art. “That is also perhaps the reason it was not named something like a ‘Lazeez Khana’ because we were never about food. We were always about coffee, culture and conversations. It was named United Coffee House because we were unified by thoughts and cultures,” says Akash Kalra, managing director, United Group, who grew up listening to how his grandfather founded the restaurant which is now in its 84th year.

The first course dazzles, the middle one tests you, and dessert usually arrives like a white flag. But at the Masters of Food & Wine dinner at Park Hyatt Chennai, the rhythm felt different. Chefs Balaji Natarajan, Executive Chef Park Hyatt Chennai, and Ashley Nunes, Executive Chef Park Hyatt Hyderabad, were clearly thinking about energy — how a plate lands, and how quickly it disappears. The result was a seven-course dinner that did not behave like a marathon, but more like a steadily unfolding competition between two chefs who enjoy agreeing and disagreeing in flavour. “We knew the menu had to keep building tempo with every course,” Ashley said. With Ashley rooted in European technique and Balaji grounded in South Indian flavour, they realised early on that their defaults did not naturally overlap. They needed a meeting point, and Japanese cuisine became that anchor. From there, the menu took shape as a relay, each course picking up where the previous one left off. The evening opens with an amuse-bouche of warm bread and three compound butters — miso, chive, and a South Indian podi that maps out the flavours the chefs were negotiating. Then begins the sequence of courses, each paired with a wine that shaped the pace of the meal. Chef Balaji Natarajan

If one were to travel from southern Kerala to the north, the ingredients of thesadya, the way the dishes are cooked, placed on the banana leaf and the order in which they are served changes.

Newly-weds Murali K and Sandhya Rajendran (names changed on request) remember the confusion when they celebrated their first Onam together with asadya. The banana leaves were washed and dried. That is when they realised they had no clue how to place the banana leaf. Should the tapered end face right or left? And what about the plethora of dishes that had arrived from the caterer? There was no instruction on how to serve it and where it should be placed on theela.
