{"id": "f365929f-ece", "text": "Camillo Golgi and Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal: Nobel Prize-winning pioneers who described the nervous systemPremium Though divided by fierce scientific rivalry \u2014 Golgi defending the idea of a continuous nerve network, Cajal championing the \u201cneuron doctrine\u201d, their discoveries together reshaped biology. Golgi\u2019s revolutionary staining method revealed the hidden architecture of nerve cells, while Cajal\u2019s interpretations proved that the nervous system was made of individual units: neurons. Their Nobel Prize marked not only a clash of ideas but the birth of modern neuroscience, and its impact extends to global health, neurology, psychiatry and public policy even today. Camillo Golgi was born on July 7, 1843, in Corteno, Italy. From modest beginnings, he studied medicine at the University of Pavia and began his career as a physician in psychiatric and hospital wards. With limited resources, he improvised laboratory space in his own kitchen. Out of these unassuming beginnings came one of the most transformative methods in biology: the silver chromate stain (a chemical reaction used to create a brick-red or brown-black color to make certain things, especially cells, visible under a microscope). Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal, born on May 1, 1852, in Petilla de Arag\u00f3n, Spain, was raised under the stern discipline of his physician father. A gifted illustrator who once dreamed of becoming an artist, he redirected his talents toward science. His eye for detail and artistic hand later gave rise to some of the most iconic images in the history of medicine: the first clear drawings of neurons. In 1873, Golgi developed thereazione nera\u2014 the \u201cblack reaction.\u201d The method impregnated a small fraction of nerve cells with silver chromate, revealing their entire shape under the microscope: cell body, dendrites, and axon. For the first time, the nervous system was visible not as a blur but as a forest of branching, living structures. A human neocortical\u00a0pyramidal neuron\u00a0stained via Golgi technique.

The discovery not only guided prevention and treatment but also shaped public health strategies worldwide. Robert Koch was born on December 11, 1843, in Clausthal, a mining town in the Harz Mountains of Germany. A precocious child, he taught himself to read by age five and later studied medicine at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, where pathologist Jacob Henle, an early proponent of germ theory left a lasting influence. After graduating in 1866, Koch worked as a country doctor and briefly served as a military physician during the Franco-Prussian War. Without access to formal laboratory facilities, he built his own microscopes and equipment, devising simple but effective methods that foreshadowed his breakthroughs in microbiology. Koch\u2019s first great success came in 1876, when he identified Bacillus anthracis as the cause of anthrax. He introduced new methods to culture bacteria in pure form using gelatin and later agar, and developed staining techniques to make microbes visible under the microscope. From these experiments, he formulated Koch\u2019s postulates, four criteria to establish a causal link between a microorganism and a disease. These postulates provided microbiology with its first rigorous framework, which continues to influence infectious disease research today, though adapted for viruses and molecular methods. Koch\u2019s most celebrated discovery came in 1882. In a landmark lecture to the Berlin Physiological Society, he announced that he had identified the tubercle bacillus (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) as the cause of tuberculosis.

The policy, adopted in 1991, will be discussed and voted on later this week by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine advisers hand-picked by U.S. health secretary and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \"After extensive review, we did not discover safety or effectiveness data that support delaying the choice parents have to vaccinate their newborns against hepatitis B,\" said Michael Osterholm, an infectious-disease expert at the University of Minnesota who helped found the Vaccine Integrity Project that released the review. The Vaccine Integrity Project is an initiative dedicated to safeguarding vaccine use in the United States set up to counter controversial vaccine information and recommendations from the Trump administration that are lacking or contrary to scientific evidence. The revamped CDC advisory panel, following Kennedy's firing of all 17 previous expert members, in September decided to postpone a vote to delay the birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine.\u2019 Since then, U.S. President Donald Trump and other health officials have called for delaying the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine until as late as age 12, saying that the virus is largely sexually transmitted. Osterholm said the evidence clearly supports keeping the current U.S. policy. Hepatitis B is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis B virus. It primarily spreads through blood, semen, or certain other body fluids. Infants infected with hepatitis B during their first year of life have a 90% chance of developing a chronic infection, increasing the risk of serious liver disease such as cirrhosis or cancer. In a 2024 study reviewed by the Vaccine Integrity Project, the CDC had analysed data on children born between 1994 and 2023 and found that offering the ", "label": "NO", "source": "data/iex_explained_classified.csv", "year": "2025", "paper": "The Hindu", "topic_hint": ""}

The initiative, led jointly by the Oriental Research Institute (ORI), Mysuru, and the Karnataka State Archives, aligns with the Union government\u2019s Digital India Mission and the National Mission for Manuscripts. Officials said the portal will provide global access to the State\u2019s cultural heritage and strengthen long-term conservation and research. As a key component of the plan, ORI Mysuru is set to house the National Centre for the History of Indian Sciences, further strengthening its role as a premier knowledge repository. The Institute has already embarked on an ambitious programme to digitise its entire collection of palm leaf and paper manuscripts, while also establishing a dedicated website to make rare resources accessible to scholars worldwide. To accelerate digitisation, ORI has entered into an MoU with the Mahabharata Pratishthana, Bengaluru, and is also partnering with the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA), New Delhi. The Institute is upgrading its technology infrastructure to support AI-enabled tools for script recognition, metadata tagging, and digital restoration of damaged materials - an area where initial experiments have shown promising results, officials pointed out. A short audio-visual presentation has already been produced to demonstrate ongoing work and showcase the transformative potential of the digital heritage initiative. Training programmes for digital archivists and expanded digitisation capacity are also part of the broader roadmap.

Sritej has shown only 5% recovery and continues to undergo intensive neuro-rehabilitation in Hyderabad. Speaking toThe Hindu, a family member said that progress of the victim has been painfully slow despite round-the-clock care. \u201cHe is unable to talk, eat or drink on his own, and sometimes even struggles to breathe,\u201d the relative said, describing a year marked by uncertainty and heavy emotional strain. Eight-years-old at the time of the incident, Sritej suffered severe brain injury and oxygen supply to his brain was cut off during the stampede. Doctors say the damage was extensive, and that recovery depends on the brain gradually regaining the ability to interpret signals. After being admitted to KIMS Hospital, Secunderabad, in a semi-conscious state with dangerously low oxygen saturation on the night of December 4, 2024, he was immediately intubated and placed on ventilator support in the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit. He remained there for over four months before beingdischarged on April 29, 2025 and moved to a neuro-rehabilitation facilityfor long-term treatment. For the family, the past year has felt frozen in grief. Sritej\u2019s mother, 35-year-old M. Revathi, died in the stampede. She, her husband Bhaskar, and their two children had gone to the screening because Sritej was an ardent fan of Allu Arjun, an outing that turned into devastation. \u201cLife has not moved at all for us. We lost her, and now he is fighting every day,\u201d the family member said. The financial burden has been equally crushing. According to Sritej\u2019s father, Magudampalli Bhaskar, the family needs nearly \u20b990,000 a month for treatment every month, besides the additional expenses. \u201cThe treatment is expensive, and we need more help.

Hypertension is the leading modifiable risk factor for heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease, Apple noted, adding that it impacts approximately 1.3 billion adults globally. Apple Watches will use data from the device\u2019s optical heart sensor, analysing how users\u2019 blood vessels respond to heartbeats. The algorithm works passively in the background, per Apple, reviewing data over 30-day periods. Users are set to be notified if the watch detects consistent signs of hypertension. The gadget-maker added that if users get a hypertension notification, it is recommended that they log their blood pressure for a week with a blood pressure cuff and share the results with a doctor. \u201cWhile hypertension notifications will not detect all instances of hypertension, with the reach of Apple Watch, the feature is expected to notify over 1 million people with undiagnosed hypertension within the first year,\u201d noted Apple in a newsroom article.

He was responding to a question on whether the government proposes to expand the use of AI-enabled early-warning systems for real-time detection of disease outbreaks, antimicrobial resistance patterns and public health emergencies across states. The Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools since April 2022, in media scanning and verification to detect early warning signals and generate alerts for timely management of potential outbreaks, Jadhav said.

Most of the deaths were attributed to chikungunya -- characterized by fever and joint pain that can be debilitating but rarely fatal -- while the flu-like dengue claimed 12 lives, the country's deputy health minister Carilda Pena said on state TV. The chikungunya virus emerged in Cuba's western Matanzas province in July, but soon spread to all 15 provinces of the country of 9.7 million people. Simultaneously, the communist island has been afflicted by an outbreak of dengue that hit as Cuba battles shortages of clean water, food, fuel and medicine during its worst economic crisis in decades. Cuba, long known for its medical and pharmaceutical expertise, was able to deal a swift blow to a previous chikungunya outbreak in 2014. This time, the one-party state reports, the outbreak spiraled out of control due to \"lack of hygiene, accumulated garbage\" and people storing water in tanks to mitigate the intermittent availability of clean tap water.

In advanced or aggressive tumours, a multimodal approach yields the best outcomes by targeting cancer at various levels. Surgery excises the solid tumour and adjoining lymph-nodes, adjuvant radiation destroys microscopic cancer cells in the tumour bed after surgery, and chemotherapy destroys cancer cells that are potentially circulating in the body. With  advances in robotics and radiation therapy enhancing  precision care and saving patients\u2019 lives, it is important for patients and caregivers to understand these new techniques. Robotic surgery, a cutting-edge form of minimally invasive (keyhole) surgery, is rapidly transforming cancer care worldwide. Unlike traditional open or laparoscopic procedures, robotic platforms allow surgeons to operate in hard-to-reach areas of the body with unprecedented precision and flexibility, making it an increasingly preferred option for complex cancer surgeries. The most widely used system today is not an autonomous robot but a highly sophisticated master-slave tele manipulator.

It governs how the body uses energy, maintains hormonal balance and supports vital functions. When metabolic processes remain efficient, the body is better protected from disease. When they weaken, several health issues begin to surface. Many conditions that are now common\u2014such as type 2 diabetes, fatty liver, hypertension, obesity and PCOS\u2014share a common root in metabolic imbalance. What makes this especially important is how quietly these changes develop. Early signs are often subtle, appearing as low energy, irregular sleep, increased appetite or gradual weight gain. Because these symptoms feel routine, they are often overlooked. Daily lifestyle patterns have a major influence on metabolic health. Long hours of sitting, irregular meal timings, excessive processed foods and inadequate sleep gradually push the body into a state of poor energy regulation. Over time, this affects blood sugar control, fat distribution and inflammation levels, creating a higher risk for chronic illness. On a positive note,  metabolic health responds well to steady, practical changes. A  balanced approach to food, regular movement, and consistent sleep routines help the body use energy more effectively. Awareness also plays a key role\u2014individuals who recognise their risk factors are able to make timely adjustments long before disease sets in. Routine health assessments further support early detection and prevention. Ultimately, metabolic health is shaped by  choices made every day.

Experts widely note that the public often associates frozen shoulder with a major injury, but this assumption delays care. \u201cHonestly, many people get frozen shoulder without any big trigger,\u201d says Dr. Kalaivanan. Limited arm movement in daily life can slowly inflame and tighten the shoulder capsule. Even mild pain, if it leads to avoiding movement can accelerate stiffness. Chetan Shashikant Pophale, senior consultant, spine surgeon, Apollo Speciality Hospitals, OMR, Chennai, adds that in a large share of cases the problem starts simply because the shoulder is not taken through its full range for long periods. \u201cEven slight posture-related strain, diabetes, thyroid ", "label": "NO", "source": "data/thh_articles_yes_classified.csv", "year": "2025", "paper": "The Hindu", "topic_hint": ""}

But if the digestive tract isn\u2019t as healthy as it should be, it could cause a number of issues. One condition pertaining to the digestive tract, is Crohn\u2019s disease. And this week being marked as awareness week for Crohn\u2019s, here is all you need to know about it. Crohn\u2019s disease is a long-term condition in which the digestive tract becomes swollen and inflamed. The digestive tract is the long, hollow tube from the mouth to the anus, comprising the esophagus, stomach, small intestine and large intestine. While Crohn\u2019s disease can affect in part of the digestive tract, it is most often the small and large intestine that are affected. Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis are two common conditions that fall under the category ofinflammatory bowel disease. Crohn\u2019s disease is named after Burrill B. Crohn, an American gastroenterologist who first described the condition in 1932, along with his colleagues,  Leon Ginzburg and Gordon D. Oppenheimer. The type of Crohn\u2019s disease depends on which part of the digestive system is affected. In ileocolitis, the most common form, the end or lower part of the small intestine and part of the large intestine are affected. Ileitis affects only the ileum or small intestine, while colitis affects only the large intestine (colon). Gastroduodenal is when the stomach and the beginning of the small intestine (duodenum) are affected. In jejunitis, the upper half of the small intestine (jejunum) is affected, while in perianal disease, there is inflammation around the anus. The exact cause of Crohn\u2019s disease is not fully understood as yet, but researchers believe several factors may play a role in its development. It is thought that the disease may be linked to the immune system: a normal immune system reaction triggers inflammation that eventually goes away, but in atypical reaction, bacteria that is normally found in the", "label": "NO", "source": "data/thh_articles_yes_classified.csv", "year": "2025", "paper": "The Hindu", "topic_hint": ""}

A precocious child, he taught himself to read by age five and later studied medicine at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, where pathologist Jacob Henle, an early proponent of germ theory left a lasting influence. After graduating in 1866, Koch worked as a country doctor and briefly served as a military physician during the Franco-Prussian War. Without access to formal laboratory facilities, he built his own microscopes and equipment, devising simple but effective methods that foreshadowed his breakthroughs in microbiology. Koch\u2019s first great success came in 1876, when he identified Bacillus anthracis as the cause of anthrax. He introduced new methods to culture bacteria in pure form using gelatin and later agar, and developed staining techniques to make microbes visible under the microscope. From these experiments, he formulated Koch\u2019s postulates, four criteria to establish a causal link between a microorganism and a disease. These postulates provided microbiology with its first rigorous framework, which continues to influence infectious disease research today, though adapted for viruses and molecular methods.

Many bacteria and parasites don\u2019t simply swim or glide in straight lines. In three dimensions, they trace corkscrew-like tracks through their surroundings. Malaria parasites, for example, glide through soft 3D gels and, in the skin of a bitten host, on paths that look like stretched springs. For any such organism, the main challenge is noise. Random bursts of energy from their environment and fluctuations in their own force-generating machinery constantly try to twist it off course. Classic work onEscherichia colibacteria has shown that a bacterium can lose its orientation within about a second because of rotational diffusion, i.e. collisions with surrounding molecules that slowly yet surely randomise its direction. Yet malaria parasites and other similar microorganisms must stay roughly on track for tens of seconds or more if they\u2019re to find nutrients and \u2014 in the parasite\u2019s case \u2014 a blood vessel.

The solution is two-pronged - stop making more waste and clean up the waste already made. Bioremediation literally means \u201crestoring life through biology.\u201d It harnesses microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, algae and plants to sequester or transform toxic substances such as oil, pesticides, plastics, or heavy metals. These organisms metabolise these pollutants as food, breaking them down into harmless by-products such as water, carbon dioxide, or organic acids. In some cases, they can convert toxic metals into less dangerous forms that no longer leach into the soil or groundwater. There are two broad types: In situ bioremediation,where treatment happens directly at the contaminated site \u2014 think oil-eating bacteria sprayed on an ocean spill. Ex situ bioremediation,where contaminated soil or water is removed, treated in a controlled facility, and returned once cleaned.

The new research, publishedineBioMedicine, part of The LancetDiscovery Science, has identified specific genetic markers that significantly increase susceptibility to oral cavity cancer, one of the most common and preventable cancers in India, primarily linked to tobacco use. The Genome-Wide Association study (GWAS) was done by researchers at Centre for Cancer Epidemiology (CCE), ACTREC. Researchers compared 2,160 cases of Buccal Mucosa cancer with 2,325 controls from various geographical regions in India and conducted a genome-wide scan to understand the role of genetic susceptibility in the development of oral cancer. They discovered genetic risk loci on chromosomes 5 and 6, near the genes CLPTM1L-TERT, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQB1, and CEP43. Additionally, a meta-analysis that included data from Europe and Taiwan identified novel risk loci near the NOTCH1 gene. The investigators calculated a polygenic risk score and found that tobacco chewers with a high polygenic risk score (indicating higher genetic susceptibility) developed Buccal Mucosa cancer 10 years earlier than those with a low polygenic risk score. In India, there are around 1,41,342 cases of oral cancer, with an average age-standardised rate of 10.0 per 1,00,000 people. In some states, this rate ranges from 25 to 33 per 100,000.

Rather than a wall with two fixed slits, he imagined a very light slit that would recoil when a single photon passed through it. If one could measure that recoil, one could in principle tell which path the photon took. At the same time, one could also look for an interference pattern, which is a sign that light behaves like a wave. Einstein hoped this would show a conflict inside quantum theory itself. Niels Bohr however argued that the plan would fail. For almost a century, the argument stayed on paper because nobody had a way to test the idea. A new study by University of Science and Technology of China researchers has now realised a way, by replacing the movable slit with a single atom. The findings were published inPhysical Review Letterson December 2. A focused laser beam held the atom in place. The researchers cooled the atom close to its ground state, where its random motion was as small as quantum physics allowed. In this state, the uncertainty in the atom\u2019s momentum is similar to the momentum of a single photon. The idea was to check whether the atom\u2019s recoil could be used to say which way a photon went and how that information affected the interference pattern. In the study team\u2019s setup, a photon scattered off the trapped atom in a way that defined two possible paths, which were then recombined to form bright and dark fringes on a detector. At the same time, the photon gave the atom a small \u2018kick\u2019 upwards or downwards, depending on the path. Thus, knowing more about the atom\u2019s recoil told the team more about which path the photon took. By tweaking the beam\u2019s strength, the team could tune the atom\u2019s momentum uncertainty. When the uncertainty was large, the two recoil states overlapped and it became impossible to tell which path the photon took, yet the interference pattern was sharp. When the uncertainty was small, the recoil was distinct but the interference became less visible.

If left untreated, the infection had a near-100% mortality rate, relentlessly destroying the immune system and leaving patients vulnerable to fatal opportunistic infections.

Of this about 10,000 m3, less than 5% by volume but containing most of the radioactivity, needs deep, long-term geological storage in the form of geological disposal facilities (GDFs). These caverns purpose-built hundreds of metres underground are packed with waste containers, cement backfill, and a suitable host rock such as clay. Cement plays several roles in these facilities, including holding waste in place, supporting tunnels and vaults, and helping slow the movement of radioactive elements if groundwater ever gets in. Conventional Portland cement has a very high pH, above 12, which is good for strength and for trapping many radionuclides, but it also creates problems. When water is exposed to this cement it becomes very alkaline itself, and thus able to corrode steel and aluminium, produce hydrogen gas, and damage clay barriers like bentonite by weakening their ability to absorb fluids. To avoid creating such problems in the repository, engineers have developed low-pH cements with porewater pH closer to 10\u201311. These mixes reduce the amount of ordinary Portland cement and add materials such as silica fume and blast furnace slag, producing calcium-silicate-hydrate gels. One such formulation, known as the CEBAMA mix, has emerged as a strong candidate for use in European disposal concepts. It has a lower pH with a favourable mechanical performance and chemical compatibility with clays and host rocks. However, there are still important questions about how CEBAMA will evolve over many centuries \u2014 due to chemical influences as well as in the presence of microbes that live in alkaline and low oxygen environments.

It could be the first attempt to establish a permanent nuclear power source beyond earth orbit, signalling the start of a new era in space. While solar energy can power some simple moon-based activities, it\u2019s constrained by the two-week-long lunar nights and the scarcity of sunlight at the poles. For a sustained moon and Mars presence, humans\u2019 energy independence thus becomes a critical enabler. This is also why the US\u2019s lunar nuclear programme is notable. In conversations on this topic on the earth, nuclear power often features as an alternative that is compact, dense, and reliable. Devices called radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) have powered the Voyager spacecrafts\u2019 odyssey through the solar system. They convert heat released by the slow decay of plutonium-238 nuclei into electricity, and are immune to dust and darkness. But RTGs only produce a few hundred watts of electric power, enough for instruments but insufficient for human habitats or industrial operations. Compact fission reactors are the next leap. About the size of a shipping container, these reactors can generate tens to hundreds of kilowatts, and can power life support, laboratories, and manufacturing units. The next leap on the demand side will be industrial operations like in-situ resource utilisation, which can convert Martian water ice into rocket fuel and oxygen, which need over 1 MW of continuous power. Sunlight alone can\u2019t reliably supply this magnitude beyond the earth\u2019s orbit. This is where nuclear power reactors are attractive. On Mars, reactors buried beneath the regolith could take advantage of the natural shielding to protect equipment and inhabitants from cosmic radiation while producing large amounts of energy.

Adrenaline levels rise, your heart races, palms sweat, and blood flow and muscle tone are redistributed to prepare you to act. Your bladder and bowels are controlled by smooth muscle and sphincters. Stress hormones can make the bladder muscle more irritable and can loosen the sphincter. Thus you may feel your bladder is fuller than it really is or that you\u2019re closer to leaking. Similarly, anxiety can change the pattern of contractions in the intestines and sometimes speed up movement in certain segments, producing cramps and an urgent need to pass stool. Many researchers believe that among animals, emptying the bladder or bowels could make the body slightly lighter and more agile and may also remove internal distractions so that an animal can focus on escaping or fighting. Even if this logic isn\u2019t complete, the fact remains that evolution has tolerated clearing waste under acute stress over a long time. Anxiety also changes how you pay attention to bodily sensations. Sensations from the bladder and gut that you\u2019d normally ignore become harder to do so. In people with chronic anxiety, signals travel back and forth along nerves such as the vagus nerve and stress hormones influence how sensitive the intestines are.

The bill, known as the SAFE CHIPS Act, was filed by Republican Senator Pete Ricketts and Democrat Chris Coons. It would require the Commerce Department, which oversees export controls, to deny any license requests for buyers in China, Russia, Iran or North Korea to receive U.S. AI chips more advanced than the ones they currently are allowed to obtain for 30 months. After that, Commerce would have to brief Congress on any proposed rule changes a month before they take effect.

The observation, recorded during a routine evening field visit in April, opens an unexpected window into the behaviour of a species long assumed to remain within sandy stretches of the intertidal zone. The sighting occurred when Harish Prakash, a faculty member in the Department of Life Sciences at GITAM University, accompanied by researchers Abhisree MK and Rohan Kumar, noticed an unusual movement on the beach at low tide. What at first appeared to be the typical foraging activity of shoreline fauna soon revealed itself to be a rare interaction. A horn-eyed ghost crab, a species widely regarded as a keystone species and indicator of coastal health, was seen handling and consuming a mottled lightfoot crab. The latter is a species that occupies rocky crevices and does not ordinarily cross paths with its sand-dwelling counterpart. Harish explains that the significance of this record lies not only in the act of predation but also in the geographical overlap it implies. \u201cThe horn-eyed ghost crab is generally restricted to sandy zones. Its possible presence within the rocky section of the intertidal area indicates a behavioural extension, likely tied to nocturnal foraging,\u201d he says. According to Harish, this is the first documented instance of the species actively hunting this particular crab, which suggests a temporary merging of habitats where sand and stone occur in close succession. The research team believes that such interactions could be limited to these transitional areas, where the rhythm of waves and tides creates mixed terrain.  \u201cGeneralist predators, such as ghost crabs, tend to adjust their diet to the availability of prey, which varies across seasons and locatio", "label": "NO", "source": "data/thh_articles_yes_classified.csv", "year": "2025", "paper": "The Hindu", "topic_hint": ""}

On rare occasions, the second look totally upends conclusions made from the initial glance. That is how a bird record from Adyar Estuary on October 26 underwent a revision. The bird was first believed to be a Dusky Crag Martin, and the photos were squatting in the memory card largely unseen, even less examined. Around a month later, a study of the photos by an eBird reviewer demanded a re-identification of the bird. And as it turned out, what had been seen on the last Sunday of October in 2025 was an altogether different feather, one spiralling into Chennai for the first time. The visitor to the Adyar Estuary, that day, that was mistaken for a Dusky Crag Martin was actually an Indian edible-nest swiftlet (Aerodramus unicolor), also known as the Indian swiftlet.

The Modi Government has now nearly signed a death warrant for these hills, already denuded by illegal mining. It has declared that any hills in the range with an elevation of less than 100 metres are not subject to the strictures against mining. It is an open invitation for illegal miners and mafias to finish off 90% of the range which falls below the height limit set by the Government. On the northernmost end of the Aravalli range, the national capital has embarked on its annual smog season this month. A hazy mist of dust, smoke and particulate matter has been settling down on millions of citizens as they go about their daily lives breathing in toxic air. Even as the smog becomes a part of our yearly routine, research increasingly shows that it is a full-scale, slow-motion public health tragedy. Estimates of the human toll of this pollution go as high as 34,000 deaths in just 10 cities annually. Last week the news headlines reflected yet another evolving tragedy.

In this case \u2014 as in many States \u2014 the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation (TNCSC), which procures paddy on behalf of the Food Corporation of India (FCI), found itself in a spot because of time overruns and charges of corruption. One of the reasons cited is the rise in the coverage of the crop during the season, by about two lakh acres, which was known as early as mid-August. This is because farmers feel it is a safe bet to grow paddy rather than other crops due to minimum assured returns. The glut is not restricted to Tamil Nadu. Going by the data of the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, the procurement of paddy (in terms of rice) all over the country was nearly 119.86 lakh tonnes as on October 31, 2025 compared to 82.08 lakh tonnes on the corresponding day last year. In the last three years, with regard to rice and wheat, the quarterly opening stock position, as on October 1, was consistently higher than what is prescribed under the norms for the central pool. In the case of rice, the quantity is at least two times more than the requirement. In October this year, the stock was 356.1 lakh tonnes against the norm of 102.5 lakh tonnes. Compared to wheat, rice is still abundant, if one goes by the Union government\u2019s data for the last three years on procurement and offtake under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) and other schemes.

Nowhere is harnessing this potential more urgently than in the agriculture sector, the backbone of India\u2019s economy and the largest employer of its women. Despite their growing presence on farms, women\u2019s contributions remain systematically unremunerative. By leveraging recent shifts in trade and technology, India has an unprecedented opportunity to unlock pathways that recognise women as equal partners in agricultural transformation. In the past decade, structural shifts in the Indian workforce have drawn rural men into higher-paying non-farm jobs, leaving women to replace them to do the agricultural work. As a result, women\u2019s employment in agriculture surged by 135%, and they now account for over 42% of the sector\u2019s workforce. Two out of every three working women are now in agriculture. Yet, this rise has come with diminishing returns. Nearly half of the women in agriculture are unpaid family workers, with their numbers jumping 2.5 times from 23.6 million to 59.1 million in just eight years. As a result, today, one in three working women in India is unpaid. In States such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, more than 80% of women workers are in agriculture, and over half of them receive no wages. Much of this invisibility stems from systemic inequities. Women are not officially recognised as farmers, own only 13-14% of land holdings, and earn 20-30% less than men for equivalent work. Asset ownership, decision-making power, and access to credit and government support remain male-dominated, trapping women in low-value activities. As a result, women\u2019s greater participation has not translated into higher income for the economy, as agriculture\u2019s share of the national GVA fell from 15.3% in 2017-18 to 14.4% in 2024-25.

Thestudyhas identified an important balance between arsenic-methylating bacteria, which convert inorganic arsenic into the toxic organic forms, versus demethylating archaea, which can undo this process. Where the methylating bacteria dominate, rice plants absorb the compound dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) and its more toxic derivative, dimethylated monothioarsenate (DMMTA). These compounds pose health risks to humans as well as induce straighthead disease. \u201cStraighthead needs to be considered as a physiological disorder rather than a disease in the absence of any infectious agent,\u201d rice pathologist Sridhar Ranganathan, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said. \u201cThe symptoms are erect panicles with unfilled grains, often remaining green.

In parts of the US and China, farmers have reported significant outbreaks, often in newly established or rotated paddies. West Bengal in India and Bangladesh have also previously reported straighthead disease. The condition can result in up to 70% yield losses in severely affected areas.

The study involved analysing data from 1975 to 2014 and examining changes through three waves over 40 years. The researchers found that small farms were indeed more productive, especially in the early years (1975\u201384), citing more intensive family labour, higher attention, and adding more fertilisers per unit compared to larger landholders. The 1960s have shown that smaller farms are generally more productive than large farms in terms of yield per acre. However, the new study proves that even during those early years, the productivity scale was not as tilted towards small farms as previously thought. The findings suggest that the inverse farm size-productivity relationship, where the productivity decreases as the farm size increases, was never as pronounced in the semi-arid regions of India. As agrarian distress dragged on in these regions, the productivity advantage of small farms faded in the later years (2009-2014). \u201cThe smallholders still matter greatly for food security and rural stability, but they are increasingly vulnerable due to monocropping and high input costs.

Originating from teosinte, a wild grass domesticated in Mesoamerica over 9,000 years ago, it was gradually transformed through centuries of selective breeding by Indigenous farmers. From a small-eared plant with a handful of hard kernels, maize thus evolved into the high-yielding, single-stalked crop recognised worldwide today. Today, maize is the world\u2019s most widely grown grain. Beyond food, it underpins global economies as animal feed, biofuel, and a raw material for countless industrial products.

Expertshave projectedthe average global maize productivity could fall by up to 24% by the late 21st century under SSP585, a high-emissions scenario consistent with continued fossil-fuel use.

One of the possible reasons for this is that the GDP growth rate was boosted by a low base, since the sector had grown just 2.2% in the July-September 2024 quarter. The other, more troubling reason, is the impact of the U.S.\u2019s tariffs. Merchandise exports grew in September, the first full month of 50% tariffs, as earlier orders were being fulfilled.

The rupee has been on a declining trend since May 2025, and it hit a fresh low at the end of August at a little more than \u20b988 per dollar. After this, analysts forecast that if the central bank did not step in at \u20b989 a dollar, it would go as high as \u20b990 a dollar. In November 2025, the rupee was down 0.8% while the dollar was also depreciating, marking a \u201cpuzzling\u201d trend, Aditi Gupta, Economist at BoB research, wrote. \u201cAnnualised daily volatility was just 1.4% in the first half but increased to 4.9% in the second half,\u201d Ms. Gupta said. While the widening trade deficit is cited as a factor, she said that the depreciation this time was more a result of the sentiments of traders in the backdrop of uncertainty surrounding the U.S.-India trade deal. \u201cReceding FPI interest in Indian equities has also added to the depreciating currency,\u201d she added. If the uncertainty continues, the rupee will stay at \u20b989 to \u20b990 a dollar, the experts concluded.", "label": "NO", "source": "data/thh_articles_yes_classified.csv", "year": "2025", "paper": "The Hindu", "topic_hint": ""}

TheGross Domestic Product (GDP)registered a six-quarter high growth of 8.2% in Q2 of 2025-26,underpinned by resilient domestic demand amidst global tradeand policy uncertainties. On the supply side, real Gross Value Added (GVA) expanded by 8.1%, aided by buoyant industrial and services sectors. Unveiling the December monetary policy, Reserve Bank Governor Sanjay Malhotra said economic activity during the first half of 2025-26 benefited from income tax and Goods and Services Tax (GST) rationalisation, softer crude oil prices, front-loading of government capital expenditure, and facilitative monetary and financial conditions supported by benign inflation. High-frequency indicators suggest that domestic economic activity is holding up in the October-December quarter, although there are some emerging signs of weakness in few leading indicators, he said. \"GST rationalisation and festival-related spending supported domestic demand during October-November,\" he said and added rural demand continues to be robust while urban demand is recovering steadily. Also, investment activity remains healthy with private investment gaining steam on the back of expansion in non-food bank credit, and high capacity utilisation. The governor also noted that merchandise exports declined sharply in October amid subdued external demand, accompanied by softer services exports. On the supply side, agricultural growth is supported by healthy kharif crop production, higher reservoir levels and better rabi crop sowing. Manufacturing activity continues to improve, while the services sector is maintaining a steady pace, Malhotra said. \"Taking all these factors into consideration, real GDP growth for 2025-26 is projected at 7.3%, with Q3 at 7%; and Q4 at 6.5%.

{"id": "9e5d98e4-015", "text": "Rupee cost averaging for NRIsPremium India\u2019s investment landscape appeals to domestic and NRI investors alike, but it doesn\u2019t come without its own set of challenges. Investors need to brace for market swings, currency fluctuations and global economic shifts. Investor sentiment has taken a hit during the recent phase of correction in the Indian market. As a result, many of them try to time the market. But it is hardly easy to time a market that moves in unpredictable cycles and makes short-term bets a risky proposition. Many investors try to chase peaks and avoid dips, only to end up making costly mistakes. A smarter strategy is Rupee Cost Averaging (RCA), allowing investors to capitalise on market volatility without getting caught up in short-term noise. Instead of worrying about the right time to invest, RCA ensures NRIs stay invested, absorb market shocks and accumulate wealth steadily over time. RCA is a disciplined investment strategy where a fixed sum is invested periodically regardless of market conditions. This means that when market prices are low, more units are purchased, and when prices rise, fewer units are bought. Over time, this strategy evens out the average investment a unit and shields investors from short-term fluctuations. Consider an NRI investing \u20b925,000 a month in an equity mutual fund via a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP). If the Net Asset Value (NAV) is \u20b9100, you purchase 250 units. If the NAV drops to \u20b980, you buy 312 units. If the NAV rises to \u20b9120, you purchase 208 units. Instead of trying to outguessing the market or thinking about when to invest, this approach allows NRIs accumulate wealth steadily while reducing risk. Market movements are unpredictable and for NRIs who are not closely tracking Indian markets daily, staying updated on every fluctuation is impractical. RCA ensures investments continue uninterrupted, eliminating the need to make impulsive decisions during downturns. By sticking to a pre-set investment plan, they can benefit from market corrections.

{"id": "d4593ba7-630", "text": "Smart credit card usage: 6 costly mistakes to avoidPremium Credit cards help you make high-ticket purchases and, when used responsibly, contribute to building a strong credit profile. However, there are some mistakes which can adversely impact your financial life if not avoided. A portion of your credit limit is available as a Cash Limit, which can be used to withdraw cash from an ATM using your credit card. However, most credit cards impose finance charges on the withdrawn amount from the first day, along with a one-time cash advance fee applicable to every ATM cash withdrawal. Additionally, purchases made after a cash withdrawal typically do not qualify for an interest-free period until the entire outstanding balance is repaid. This can lead to significant charges that may become difficult to pay off, increasing the risk of falling into a debt trap. Therefore, it is strongly advised to avoid withdrawing cash using a credit card unless it is a last resort in case of an emergency. Even if you have to opt for this, you should make sure to repay the amount as soon as possible to minimise additional charges. Credit cards provide users with a higher purchasing power. Access to more funds, combined with the convenience of an interest-free period, can sometimes lead to impulse purchases. Consistently spending beyond your means can accumulate a high credit card balance, which can potentially spiral into unmanageable debt. This raises the risk of late payments and additional costs in the form of late payment penalties and finance charges on outstanding as well as new transactions. To avoid this, the best approach is to make a monthly budget and stick to it by only spending as much as you can afford to repay at the end of the statement cycle. If you cannot clear the total dues on a card by the due date, you can have the option to pay a minimum amount due. While this helps avoid late payment fees and negative impact on your credit score, it comes with a cost. When you pay only the minimum due, as remaining balance, as well as any new", "label": "NO", "source": "data/thh_articles_yes_classified.csv", "year": "2025", "paper": "The Hindu", "topic_hint": ""}

{"id": "8af30194-c4f", "text": "The importance of Small Savings SchemesPremium Small Savings Schemes, kown as Post Office Savings Schemes, are a popular and useful means for people for channelising savings. Credit quality is top-notch as it is run by the government, and interest rates are competitive. Interest rates are fixed by the government every quarter e.g. the rates for the current quarter, April to June 2025, were announced on March 31. Today we will see, on what basis the rates are fixed by the government. As per an old decision of the Government, the rate of interest on Small Savings Schemes will be aligned with Government Security (G-Sec) rates of similar maturity with a spread i.e. mark-up. As an example, the spread on Senior Citizens Savings Scheme will be 1% over comparable maturity G-Secs. The rationale for linking it to G-Sec yields in the secondary market is that it is in line with interest rate movements; G-Sec yield movements reflect actual and anticipated economic events pertaining to interest rate movement. To clarify the concept, let us say the benchmark G-Sec rate is X% and the mark-up as per the formula is Y%. Hence, the rate should be X% plus Y%. However, if the rate is higher, say X% plus Y% plus Z%, then Z represents the generosity of the Government for the benefit of citizens. The rates on Small Savings Schemes are reviewed every quarter. However, rates are not revised downward every quarter even when G-Sec rates are sliding, which is the \u2018Z\u2019 referred earlier. Post Office Savings Deposit rate is 4%. Public Provident Fund (PPF), which is a 15-year scheme (though it can be extended), is supposed to have a spread of 25 basis points (100 bps = 1%). The relevant G-Sec rate (the average of G-Sec of corresponding maturity from December 2024 to February 2025) relevant for the quarter April to June, was 6.85%. By that logic, PPF rate is (6.85 + 0.25= 7.1%) maintained now. Post Office Term deposits of 1, 2 and 3-year maturity are to be at the corresponding G-Sec rate, without any markup.

Times have changed, and how! According to industry data, a kidney transplant that cost about \u20b95 lakh in 2013 is now more than \u20b918 lakh. A heart transplant that cost about \u20b99.8 lakh a decade ago, now costs about \u20b934 lakh. In fact, a study of medical cost trends from 2013 to 2025 showed that surgery costs had surged by up to 300% across the board. And it does not include post-operative care or long-term rehabilitation. It is fair to say that this is not a minor spike but a structural shift in healthcare economics. Now, a pertinent question is: Is my health insurance coverage growing at the same pace? By the time most of us reach our mid-40s, we have usually ticked all the important financial planning boxes: home loan, term cover and of course, health insurance. This most likely includes a \u20b910-15 lakh health policy for the family. But here\u2019s the uncomfortable truth: While healthcare costs have moved on, most of our insurance policies haven\u2019t. The reason is that medical inflation in India outpaces general inflation by a significant margin. Currently, India\u2019s retail inflation is at 3.34%. That is quite low, but on average, it hovers around 5-6%. However, medical inflation in urban India has been about 14% for a while. It is true that new-age surgical technologies are improving outcomes, but they are also pushing up the cost of medical care. For instance, what used to be a \u20b970,000 angioplasty 10 years ago now costs almost \u20b92.5 lakh. A routine knee replacement can set you back by \u20b95-6 lakh, while cancer treatment costs vary widely. But one thing is certain - they can be financially devastating sans insurance. The costliest part apart from the surgery itself is diagnostics, pre- and post-hospitalisation, ICU, medication and long-term follow-ups.

{"id": "79f7ce65-84f", "text": "India needs to design an inclusive pension systemPremium Pensions are essential for maintaining economic stability and dignity after retirement. Retirees often face financial instability due to reduced earning capacity, rising health-care costs, and inflation, necessitating a safety net in the form of pensions. The Economic Survey 2025-26 reports that Indian pension assets amount to just 17% of GDP, compared with up to 80% in many advanced economies. Currently, only around 12% of India\u2019s workforce is covered by formal pension schemes. The coverage is also disproportionate, with public sector and organised private sector workers being protected under multiple parallel schemes. In contrast, the only protection for the informal sector is voluntary adoption under the National Pension System and Atal Pension Yojana. These two schemes accounted for about 5.3 % of the total population in FY24. Integrate the informal sector Notably, almost 85% of the informal labour force is generating more than half of the country\u2019s GDP. As markets evolve, the gig economy will only expand further. Their exclusion from the pension framework is not only a policy gap but also a looming financial crisis in the making. By 2050, India\u2019s old-age dependency ratio will increase to 30%. Consequently, India\u2019s path to achieve developed economy status by 2047 will depend, in no small measure, on our efforts to secure the future against old-age poverty. Currently, the expansion of pension coverage is hindered by issues that are linked to scalability, sensitisation, and sustainability. The primary reason for the exclusion of informal workers from the pension framework is the fragmented nature of pension schemes. Although the government has introduced social security for gig workers, funded in part by aggregators, this only addresses a fraction of the informal sector and adds another parallel scheme to an already complex web.

Swaminathan, \u2018the man who fed India\u2019Premium The Viksit Bharat aspiration, which has gained considerable momentum, will require a significant development of scientific capability, and some of this, especially in the new digital economy, will have to be aatmanirbhar. There is much to learn in this context from the most successful experiment in atmanirbharata in the past, which was the achievement of food self-sufficiency in the 1960s.M.S. Swaminathanwas the man who did it and he was a living hero to all of us. This is the centenary year of his birth and it has seen the publication of a new biography,M.S. Swaminathan: the Man who Fed India, by Priyambada Jayakumar. Ms. Jayakumar had the benefit of detailed discussions with him on both the personal and professional side of his life and she has produced a book which is a great read. However, in this article, I will focus on some lessons from his experience which have relevance for the future. Scientific advancement was at the core of the Green Revolution and the book brings out that such advances are not achieved by dedicated scientists working in isolation in a lab. They involve collaboration with other scientists and a cross-fertilisation of ideas. It was known that wheat productivity could be increased through application of fertilizers and other inputs, but the problem was that the higher weight of grains caused the plant to bend and lodge if the stalk was not strong enough. Swaminathan was trying to use radiation to develop a genetic mutation that would have a stronger stalk, but this approach was not getting anywhere. M.S. Swaminathan, the conservationist and advocate of environmental protection Swaminathan walked ahead of his time: scientific community Can\u2019t think of any Indian more decorated internationally than M.S.

{"id": "a089231c-080", "text": "Why is India not importing corn from the U.S.? | Explained The story so far: Among the key areas of disagreement between the U.S. and India regarding trade is a demand that India should import U.S. corn. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said that India has 1.4 billion people but does not import a single bushel of corn from the U.S. (25 kg approximately). India\u2019s maize yield is quite poor and is below four tonnes per hectare whereas the world average is six tonnes. Despite that, India had been largely self-sufficient and has sometimes even exported maize,  mainly for poultry and other livestock feed as well as for human consumption. With the ramp up of ethanol blending of petrol, India has had to balance between its food needs and ethanol production. For instance, it has to decide between sugar manufacture versus diverting sugarcane products to ethanol production. Similarly, India has also had to ramp up maize feedstock for ethanol production. This Kharif-Rabi-Spring season, the maize crop is expected to supply some 10 to 12 million tonnes for ethanol production out of an overall 50 million tonnes production, says H.S. Jat, Director of the ICAR-Indian Institute of Maize Research in Ludhiana. He adds that there will not be any need to import maize this year given the bounty crop expected. India has, however, been importing maize in recent times, apparently for ethanol. For instance, overall maize imports were some one million tonnes in 2024-25 (60% from Myanmar and much of the rest from Ukraine). This represents an almost eight times increase over the previous year. India doesn\u2019t import U.S. corn, much of which is Genetically Modified (GM). India has allowed only GM cotton cultivation, with GM brinjal and mustard cultivation remaining in the investigation stage. Some critics say that fears over cultivating GM crops such as alleged toxicity and diseases will apply to imported GM corn produce as well if it enters the food chain.

Chennai\u2019s flat layout, increasing paved area, and the three rivers running through it from catchments in Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram also mean that when a storm system inundates those basins and Chennai together, water levels will rise quickly. Recent floods in north Chennai exposed the encroachment and shoddy desilting of the Kosasthalaiyar. With its ability to tolerate flooding diminished, the GCC had to shut some drains and pump stagnant waters against reverse flow. By lingering near Chennai, the new storm had similar effects.

This is not unprecedented as in 2018, it slid 11%-12% against the dollar. The comparison is instructive because the political and trade backdrops have echoes of that earlier period. In 2018, during the first term of U.S. President Donald Trump, global dollar strength, rising U.S. interest rates and trade tensions pressured emerging market currencies, including the rupee. The RBI used its first longer-term currency-swap as a systemic liquidity check. In 2019, it completed a $5 billion three-year dollar/rupee swap. And in February 2025, it carried out a $10 billion dollar/rupee buy-sell swap auction to infuse long-term rupee liquidity into the banking system under global stress. Such swaps are a standard tool by central banks to supply liquidity, shore up forex reserves and prevent disorderly currency depreciation when the dollar surges or capital flows reverse. The steep rupee slide in November arises in a context of external pressures \u2014 a widening current-account deficit, driven partly by higher imports of bullion, as a hedge in uncertain times, and exporters scrambling to maintain competitiveness amid high U.S. trade tariffs.

Russia would withdraw from the territories it has captured outside the five oblasts and pledge not to attack neighbouring countries again.

Antibiotic residues, resistant organisms and environmental discharge connect these sectors in powerful ways. AMR does not remain confined to hospitals. It moves through soil, water, livestock, markets and food systems, making it a true One Health challenge. Therefore, any national plan must be matched by real and coordinated action across all levels of governance. The first National Action Plan on AMR, launched in 2017, was a significant step forward. It brought AMR into national consciousness, encouraged multi-sectoral participation, improved laboratory networks, expanded national surveillance and supported stewardship. It also placed AMR firmly within a One Health framework, recognising the links between human health, animal health and the environment. Despite this progress, implementation during the first plan period remained limited at the State level. Only a small group of States \u2014 Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Sikkim and Punjab \u2014 developed formal State Action Plans, and only a few moved meaningfully into execution. The majority continued to rely on fragmented activities within individual sectors; State-wide, multisectoral One Health structures did not take shape in most parts of the country. This slow uptake was not due to a shortage of national effort, but because the major determinants of AMR fall under State jurisdiction.

Around 60 people took part. The speakers, authors Vadrevu China Veerabhadrudu and Sree Padma Holt, talked about the concept of village goddesses in A.P., how they have been reimagined and interpreted by devotees over the years with changing times and how they were finally incorporated into Shaiva, Vaishnava and other belief systems. Tracing the origin of Goddess Kanaka Durga, Padma Holt, an educator and researcher who taught in Bowdoin University, the U.S., talked about how the goddess is an amalgamation of many forms and was a grama devata at first, then a tribal goddess, then she was worhipped as the destroyer of the evil and protector of the people before being worshipped in the present form.

The case of Lieutenant Samuel Kamalesan, dismissed from the Indian Army for refusing to enter the sanctum of his regiment\u2019s temple or gurdwara during mandatory parades, is one such clash. The Delhi High Court upheld the dismissal (Samuel Kamalesan vs Union of India), and the Supreme Court of India declined to interfere. The legal result is clear. The moral unease remains. The Court relied on military necessity, discipline and the power given by the Constitution under Article 33. The judgment places his refusal within the frame of disobedience of a lawful command rather than the practice of personal faith. Seen through that narrow lens, the courts acted exactly as they believe they should in military matters: defer to the generals. But that deference should not end the national conversation.

{"id": "697150fe-91a", "text": "Flexible inflation targeting, a good balancePremium The present Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) framework in India as a mandate for monetary policy to manage inflation at 4% (+/-) 2% is ending in March 2026 and is under review. In this regard the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has brought out a well-researched discussion paper, and has several questions for which views have been sought. Here, this article addresses three questions: headline versus core (excluding food), acceptable level of inflation, and inflation band. Before responding to these questions, it is pertinent to highlight that inflation control by itself is an important objective of monetary policy. High inflation, above a tolerable level, is a regressive consumption tax that affects poorer households more disproportionately than the rich and households whose incomes are hedged. Indeed, high and volatile inflation hurts savings and misdirects investments. The issue of acceptable level of inflation came up first before the Chakravarty Committee which was of the opinion that \u201c\u2026the acceptable rise in prices is 4 per cent (reflecting changes in relative prices necessary to attract resources to growth sectors)\u2026.\u201d The reasoning given is somewhat opaque. The RBI has been focusing on inflation management all along, and more explicitly since the dismantling of automatic monetisation in 1994 that gave functional autonomy to the RBI in conducting monetary policy. In 2016, India adopted the FIT framework that also gave, in a broad sense, institutional autonomy. Since 2016, India\u2019s inflation is range-bound, by and large, despite facing multiple shocks. This is an achievement for a framework that is still evolving. An issue that keeps recurring is the issue of what to target \u2014 headline or core inflation. If the overall objective of inflation control is to promote savings and investments and to protect the poor from shocks, then headline inflation should be the appropriate target.

According to the National Judicial Data Grid, there are 4.69 crore cases pending in district courts. Another Bench of the Court has asked judges in Delhi to undergo training due to a lack of basic knowledge. There are a few options to make changes in the administration of justice. The Code of Civil Procedure and the Civil Rules of Practice contemplate procedures to be followed by courts in entertaining proceedings, issuing summons to the defendants, and for the appearance of parties. Subordinate judges handle this. They are forced to call every suit for the appearance of parties or order the issue of fresh summons and receive vakalathnamas. This takes up much time in the morning, leaving judges with very little time for the disposal of cases on merits. In most subordinate courts, the calling of cases goes on from 10.30 a.m. till well past noon. Quality time is lost by attending to such clerical and ministerial work. A judicial officer in the lowest rank in hierarchy can be appointed in every district court to call all the cases of that particular cadre of courts (senior civil judges or civil judges or district munsifs, as the case may be).

The cases can be taken up, as in this list, from 10.30 a.m. every day by each court, and these courts can dispose of matters listed till evening.
