2,2025,The Hindu,2,"For a disabled-inclusive society, committed action and accountability are the need of the hourPremium A popular video narrates the story of an individual waking up in a world designed for people with visual impairment, where writing and signage are in braille, a world that feels different and overwhelming for someone with other needs. The video serves as a gentle reminder to all of us, to perhaps look outward through a different lens. This week, December 3, proclaimed by the United Nations as the International Day of Persons with Disabilities was observed. This  is a day dedicated to promoting an understanding of disability-related issues, mobilising support, and increasing awareness to help persons with disabilities integrate into society. This year’s theme, ‘Fostering disability-inclusive societies for advancing social progress’,focuses on creating a society where every individual can participate fully and without barriers. While advocacy for the rights of persons with disabilities continues to grow, as a society, we are falling behind in translating this advocacy into practical, workable outcomes. How do we create an inclusive society and thereby promote social progress? The biggest challenge appears to be accessibility. While physical medicine and rehabilitation focus on improving mobility and reducing complications thereby enabling individuals to be more socially active, the next step is ensuring that the environment itself is accessible to persons with disabilities. Accessibility challenges are everywhere. For instance, while we have policies supporting the right to education, there remains a disconnect between policy and implementation, with many families still struggling to enrol their children in educational institutions. Similarly, expanding economic opportunities should be a priority area for policymakers committed to creating an inclusive society. In essence, building a disability-inclusive society requires more than awareness—it demands committed action, thoughtful planning, and accountability. As we reflect upon the International Day of Persons with Di",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/for-a-disabled-inclusive-society-committed-action-and-accountability-are-the-need-of-the-hour/article70356421.ece
3,2024,The Hindu,3,"Editor’s Note: Putting Muslims in their place? The return of Donald Trump to the White House shows how demagogues the world over are successfully convincing large swathes of voters that their continuing post-pandemic distress will vanish magically if they get rid of that one evil enemy. Trump identified this enemy as illegal immigrants and others whom he ominously called “the enemy within”, which seems to be the American equivalent of the “urban naxal”. If Israel and India have both created models of virulent masculinity, as Martha Nussbaum wrote, this is derived from the sense of eternal victimhood that Zionist and Hindutva fundamentalists share, and both direct their aggression at Muslims, whom the Christian colonial project had already conveniently vilified. Since 2014, a series of measures has sought to demonise India’s Muslim community—the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019,the criminalisation of triple talaq, and the various jehads fromCOVIDandlove jehadto land jehad and vote jehad. Even for the Jharkhand Assembly election campaign, the BJP has aggressively raised the bogey ofillegal Bangladeshi immigrantsrobbing tribal lands and tribal women. That the spotlight would soon turn on the Waqf Board was never in doubt. Hindutva warriors have always spread the jealous narrative of waqf being the largest property owner after the Railways and Army, a carefully cultivated piece of disinformation. If one considers that the Hindu religious boards in the three States of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana alone control more than 10 lakh acres of land, then the 9.4 lakh acres estimated to be under waqf falls into better perspective; even more so when you consider, as the Congress party’s Rajya Sabha MP Syed Naseer Hussain explains in his interview to Vikhar Ahmed Sayeed in this issue, that even the smallest cemetery and mosque in the country is technically waqf land. The returns from waqf properties have always been low and not used adequately for the benefit of disadvantaged Muslims.

Sritej has shown only 5% recovery and continues to undergo intensive neuro-rehabilitation in Hyderabad. Speaking toThe Hindu, a family member said that progress of the victim has been painfully slow despite round-the-clock care. “He is unable to talk, eat or drink on his own, and sometimes even struggles to breathe,” the relative said, describing a year marked by uncertainty and heavy emotional strain. Eight-years-old at the time of the incident, Sritej suffered severe brain injury and oxygen supply to his brain was cut off during the stampede. Doctors say the damage was extensive, and that recovery depends on the brain gradually regaining the ability to interpret signals. After being admitted to KIMS Hospital, Secunderabad, in a semi-conscious state with dangerously low oxygen saturation on the night of December 4, 2024, he was immediately intubated and placed on ventilator support in the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit. He remained there for over four months before beingdischarged on April 29, 2025 and moved to a neuro-rehabilitation facilityfor long-term treatment. For the family, the past year has felt frozen in grief. Sritej’s mother, 35-year-old M. Revathi, died in the stampede. She, her husband Bhaskar, and their two children had gone to the screening because Sritej was an ardent fan of Allu Arjun, an outing that turned into devastation. “Life has not moved at all for us. We lost her, and now he is fighting every day,” the family member said. The financial burden has been equally crushing. According to Sritej’s father, Magudampalli Bhaskar, the family needs nearly ₹90,000 a month for treatment every month, besides the additional expenses. “The treatment is expensive, and we need more help.

6,2025,The Hindu,6,"Parliament approves Bill to levy higher excise duty on tobacco Parliament on Thursday (December 4, 2025) approved a Bill to levy a higher excise duty on tobacco and related products once the GST compensation cess ends, with the Rajya Sabha returning the legislation to the Lok Sabha. The Lok Sabha passed the Central Excise (Amendment) Bill, 2025 on Wednesday (December 3). Replying to a discussion on the Bill in the Rajya Sabha, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said this was not an additional tax, and the tax burden, as currently applicable under the GST regime, would continue. She said that in the last GST Council, it was discussed in detail, and as was agreed earlier, that the compensation cess collection would probably come to a stop at the end of December. ""Let me assure here itself straight away that the tobacco products will still be taxed under the demerit category at 40% in the GST frame of things. They will still be taxed at 40%, but there will not be any compensation,"" Ms. Sitharaman said. The provisions of the Bill will come into effect once the GST compensation cess, which is currently levied on tobacco, comes to an end. The cess will cease to exist after the ₹2.69 lakh crore loan taken to compensate States for revenue loss during the COVID is repaid, which is likely to happen in the next couple of weeks. Ms. Sitharaman said the items could not be taxed beyond 40% under the new GST changes, even if they were demerit goods. ""The incidence of tax on tobacco and tobacco-related products has therefore come down. You have no compensation. The highest rate that you have in GST is 40%, and as a result, it gives the impression that the government has allowed a lesser tax on tobacco, and therefore, it's going to become affordable. The intent is not that,"" she said. The Finance Minister said that within the GST scheme of things, it continued to be at the highest rate, but now that the compensation cess could not be collected.

7,2025,The Hindu,7,"Apple Watch introduces hypertension notifications in India Apple has introduced hypertension notifications for Apple Watch users in India, enabling the smartwatch to detect signs of chronic high blood pressure/hypertension, and alert the user so they can be made aware. Hypertension is the leading modifiable risk factor for heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease, Apple noted, adding that it impacts approximately 1.3 billion adults globally. Apple Watches will use data from the device’s optical heart sensor, analysing how users’ blood vessels respond to heartbeats. The algorithm works passively in the background, per Apple, reviewing data over 30-day periods. Users are set to be notified if the watch detects consistent signs of hypertension. The gadget-maker added that if users get a hypertension notification, it is recommended that they log their blood pressure for a week with a blood pressure cuff and share the results with a doctor. “While hypertension notifications will not detect all instances of hypertension, with the reach of Apple Watch, the feature is expected to notify over 1 million people with undiagnosed hypertension within the first year,” noted Apple in a newsroom article.

The programme is mandated with surveillance and response to outbreak prone communicable diseases, Jadhav said in a written response. He was responding to a question on whether the government proposes to expand the use of AI-enabled early-warning systems for real-time detection of disease outbreaks, antimicrobial resistance patterns and public health emergencies across states. The Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools since April 2022, in media scanning and verification to detect early warning signals and generate alerts for timely management of potential outbreaks, Jadhav said. The Integrated Health Information Platform (IHIP) is a paperless, case-based, near real-time reporting system introduced in 2021 to strengthen national disease surveillance. All 36 states and Union Territories report through IHIP, which provides a unified platform for public-health monitoring at the district, state, and national levels, Jadhav stated. The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) was launched by government in September 2021 to support the development of an integrated, citizen-centric national digital health ecosystem. Several national health programme platforms, including Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY), Nikshay portal, Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) and non-communicable diseases (NCD) are integrated with ABDM enabling public health facilities in the states and UTs to use ABDM enabled software, to create Ayushman Bharat Health Accounts (ABHAs) and digital health records for seamless interoperability across the ecosystem.

Most of the deaths were attributed to chikungunya -- characterized by fever and joint pain that can be debilitating but rarely fatal -- while the flu-like dengue claimed 12 lives, the country's deputy health minister Carilda Pena said on state TV. The chikungunya virus emerged in Cuba's western Matanzas province in July, but soon spread to all 15 provinces of the country of 9.7 million people. Simultaneously, the communist island has been afflicted by an outbreak of dengue that hit as Cuba battles shortages of clean water, food, fuel and medicine during its worst economic crisis in decades. Cuba, long known for its medical and pharmaceutical expertise, was able to deal a swift blow to a previous chikungunya outbreak in 2014. This time, the one-party state reports, the outbreak spiraled out of control due to ""lack of hygiene, accumulated garbage"" and people storing water in tanks to mitigate the intermittent availability of clean tap water. With the country under US sanctions and its critical tourism sector left in ruins by Covid, a dearth of foreign currency has seen a steep decline in Cuba's medical services and prevention programmes such as mosquito fumigation.",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/chikungunya-dengue-kill-21-children-in-crisis-hit-cuba/article70352948.ece

Conducted between August and December 2023, the Chronic Kidney Disease of unknown etiology (or uncertain cause) CKDu - AGRI study surveyed agricultural workers across all five agro-climatic zones of the State -- the North-East, North-West, Western, Cauvery Delta, and Southern regions. Using a stratified multi-stage cluster sampling method, researchers studied 3,350 farm workers from 125 villages, collecting data on occupation, health and environmental exposures. The researchers observed a striking seasonal variation in kidney function. During August -- one of Tamil Nadu’s hottest months -- 17.4% of participants had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)  below 60 mL/min/1.73 m². When tested again in December, kidney function had returned to normal in most. “These were asymptomatic, sub-clinical episodes of acute kidney injury,” says R. Sakthirajan,co-author of the study, senior assistant professor, Institute of Nephrology, Madras Medical College. “Because all assays were done in a single reference laboratory, the variation almost certainly reflects physiological stress rather than measurement error.” The team point out that these transient injuries are linked to repetitive heat and dehydration stress during fieldwork -- a pattern also documented in Central America and Sri Lanka. “We plan to follow participants across different seasons to track kidney markers, hydration, and individual heat exposure,” adds Sudharshini Subramaniam, co-author of the study, associate professor, Institute of Community Medicine. “This will help confirm whether repeated seasonal stress leads to chronic kidney disease over time.” The study found an overall CKD prevalence of 5.31%, with nearly half of these cases classified as Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown aetiology (CKDu) -- that ",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/study-reveals-heat-linked-kidney-strain-among-tamil-nadus-agricultural-workers/article70220409.ece

The congress, which brought together 250 international and 450 national faculty, and 1,200 delegates, is a four-day event that aims to spread awareness on nuclear medicine and scale up its services in India, said E. Prabhu, president, SNMI. Nuclear medicine is a specialty of medicine in which minute quantities of radioactive material are used for diagnosis and treatment. While it is now a well-established specialty in India, with 540 nuclear medicine centres, it still serves only a small fraction of the population and is heavily concentrated in the private sector, Dr. Prabhu said. Currently, 87% of the nuclear medicine centres function in the private sector, while a majority of training happens at government institutions. “At present, our 540 centres serve, on an average, 0.7 per million population. In the United States, nuclear medicine centres serve 4 per million of the population; in Germany, it is 10 per million, and in Japan, 20 per million,” he pointed out. The need for greater awareness, greater patronage and financial resources as well as innovative strategies to scale up nuclear medicine services are some of the many issues being discussed at the Congress, Dr. Prabhu contended. “In order to scale up to at least a few per million in India, we will require 2,700 centres,” he said.

The 32-year-old was among the very first South Africans -- and Africans -- to receive a dose of lenacapavir, a drug taken twice a year that has been shown to reduce the risk of HIV transmission by more than 99.9 percent, making it functionally akin to a powerful vaccine. ""I didn't even feel any pain,"" she said with a relieved smile after receiving the two injections that form the first dose. Five other patients received lenacapavir Tuesday at a clinic outside of Pretoria as part of an implementation study by a Wits University research unit and funded by the international health agency Unitaid, which works on ensuring equitable access to medical innovations. The study would enrol 2,000 people and ""follow them for at least a year to understand how this prevention option works in real life"", according to the Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute (RHI)'s Saiqa Mullick. With close to one in five adults living with HIV, South Africa has one of the highest rates in the world, and reported last year the highest number of new infections for any single country -- 170,000. Until now, the best available prevention drug for HIV-negative people was through a daily pill. The twice-yearly lenacapavir jab would be ""life-changing"", said the clinic's manager Magdaline Ngwato, especially for young people who struggled to maintain the daily schedule of the pill and groups like sex workers or LGBTQ patients who wanted to be discreet.

16,2025,The Hindu,16,"Could unregulated use of alternative medicines be causing kidney disease in Telangana?Premium Across Telangana,doctors are battling a problem that is becoming increasingly common: kidney failure. These patients are young, many are the breadwinners of their families, and most do not have the usual risk factors of chronic kidney disease (CKD), which are diabetes and hypertension. Then why are their kidneys failing? Even as researchers continue to examine the drivers of this pattern and nephrologists struggle to save patients,a paper published last year, may perhaps point to one of possible answer: the growing number of patients consuming self-prescribed alternative medicines. While the link has not yet been scientifically established, this is a line of inquiry researchers now want to pursue. It may be noted that certain alternative medicines have beenimplicated in liver injuriesin India. The study, led by nephrologists from Osmania General Hospital and Apollo Hospitals, examined 75 patients and was published in theIndian Journal of Nephrologyin August 2024. Conducted between March 2021 and November 2022 at Osmania General Hospital, it was a single-centre, prospective observational study documenting the clinical and epidemiological profile of patients with chronic kidney disease of unknown aetiology in Telangana and assessing their kidney histology. Among the 75 patients, the mean age was 41.7 years and 68% were men. A majority, amounting to 77.3%, relied on groundwater as their primary drinking water source. 40% reported having used alternative medicine in the past and 46.6% underwent kidney biopsies as part of the evaluation. Manisha Sahay, professor and head of the nephrology department at Osmania General Hospital and one of the authors of the study, said many patients who report using alternative medicine had taken these substances without medical guidance. “Patients often rely on suggestions from friends or unlicensed quacks who do not hold any degree in any recognised system of medicine.

17,2025,The Hindu,17,"From robotic surgery to radiation beams: understanding precision healing in oncologyPremium Cancer treatment is essentially governed by the holy trinity of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. In advanced or aggressive tumours, a multimodal approach yields the best outcomes by targeting cancer at various levels. Surgery excises the solid tumour and adjoining lymph-nodes, adjuvant radiation destroys microscopic cancer cells in the tumour bed after surgery, and chemotherapy destroys cancer cells that are potentially circulating in the body. With  advances in robotics and radiation therapy enhancing  precision care and saving patients’ lives, it is important for patients and caregivers to understand these new techniques. Robotic surgery, a cutting-edge form of minimally invasive (keyhole) surgery, is rapidly transforming cancer care worldwide. Unlike traditional open or laparoscopic procedures, robotic platforms allow surgeons to operate in hard-to-reach areas of the body with unprecedented precision and flexibility, making it an increasingly preferred option for complex cancer surgeries. The most widely used system today is not an autonomous robot but a highly sophisticated master-slave tele manipulator. The surgeon sits at an ergonomic console, viewing a magnified 3D high-definition image while controlling robotic arms equipped with wristed instruments that offer greater dexterity than the human hand. Every movement is directly translated in real time — the robot never acts independently. Features such as  tremor filtration and motion scaling enable delicate tasks that were previously difficult or impossible with conventional methods. For cancer patients, robotic surgery offerssignificant advantages: considerably less pain, minimal blood loss, fewer infections, smaller scars, shorter hospital stays, and a quicker return to normal life. Importantly, multiple large studies have shown that cancer cure rates and long-term cancer outcomes are equivalent to open or laparoscopic surgery.

19,2025,The Hindu,19,"All you need to know about: tongue tiesPremium Is your baby unable to latch on deep enough during breast feeding, does she spit out milk often, or does she seem to choke on it, is she not putting on weight though feeding frequently? It might be just a thick fold of tissue in the baby’s mouth. Maybe, it is time to check if your baby has a tongue tie, or a lip tie. Both conditions, also referred to as Ankylogloassia, have a similar cause. A  fold of tissue, called the frenulum, which is attached to the gums, is thicker than normal and thus restricts lip movement. In the mouth, there are two types of frenula - the fold connecting the tongue to the floor of the mouth, called lingual frenulum, and the fold connecting the lips to the gums, also known as labial frenulum. The function of these folds is to provide support to the tongue and lips, allowing for normal movement of the mouth, but sometimes, the fold can become thick, or unnaturally short, restricting free movement. An abnormal lingual frenulum causes tongue ties and a problem with the  labial frenulum and buccal frenulum can cause a lip tie and cheek tie, respectively. What exactly causes the thickening of the frenulum is not clear, but dentists have advanced the argument that it could be genetic, and is passed down generations. The Wright Parkway Dental Clinic in Florida, U.S., in a social media post, had listed statistics which show that about 10% of babies are born with a lip tie and nearly 8% of babies have a tongue tie. Authors of apaperin theInternational Journal of Paediatric Otorhinolaryngologymention that while tongue tie is the most well-known of these conditions, lip tie and cheek tie have gained increasing attention in recent years due to their potential impact on breastfeeding, speech, and dental health.

Former Inspector General of Police (IGP) Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, who turned a witness and testified before the tribunal against Ms. Hasina and Mr. Kamal, has been sentenced to five years in prison after he admitted to his involvement in the crackdown of the protests which led to the fall of the Hasina government. The verdict by the International Crimes Tribunal-1 (ICT-1) represents the most dramatic legal action against the Awami League leader and comes just months before the parliamentary elections, which are scheduled for February. The tribunal also asked the government to provide compensation to the families of the victims and to those who were injured during the crackdown. Attorney-General Md Asaduzzaman said Ms. Hasina, who is now in exile in India, and Mr. Kamal, who is also in exile, cannot appeal the ruling as long as they remain fugitives.

Not only is it a question of time, Kejriwal is also wary of “mainstream” media, a fact that he admits when we finally meet. After a postponement, the interview is set for 9:00 pm, and when we get to his current residence at 5 Ferozeshah Road, Kejriwal has just returned from a long day of campaigning for what is being seen as a make-or-break election for both him and his party. But Kejriwal himself does not display any such anxiety. He enters the drawing room with a smile and a slight spring in his step, visibly tired but upbeat. As we talk, his social media team calls every now and then, relating tweets that make him smile. He asks them to draft a quote tweet “that I will check later”. Hearing the news that Dhruv Rathee’s upload of Unbreakable, a 30-minute documentary about his arrest (whose screening was stopped by the Delhi Police), has garnered 8.5 million views on YouTube, his smile widens. “By stopping it, they achieved just the opposite,” he says. In the freewheeling conversation that follows, Kejriwal says that he is confident of winning Delhi a third time.

23,2025,The Hindu,23,"Laveran’s discovery of the malaria parasite and its enduring influence on infectious disease researchPremium In 1907, French physician and parasitologist Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine “in recognition of his work on the role played by protozoa in causing disease.” His discovery in 1880 that malaria is caused by a protozoan parasite -- later namedPlasmodiumrepresented a decisive break from prevailing theories that attributed the disease to “bad air” or environmental miasma. Laveran’s microscope observations in the blood of malaria patients not only revealed the biological cause of the disease but opened a new field of research in parasitic pathogens. Laveran was born on June 18, 1845, in Paris, into a family with a strong medical and military tradition. He studied at the École du Service de Santé Militaire de Strasbourg and later served as a military physician during the Franco-Prussian War. His extensive clinical exposure to febrile diseases, especially during postings in Constantine, Algeria, shaped his scientific curiosity. It was there, in a region with high malaria burden, that he made the breakthrough that defined his career. At the time, malaria was widely believed to result from environmental influences. Through careful and repeated microscopic examination of fresh blood samples, Laveran observed pigment-containing, motile organisms -- identifying them as protozoan parasites on November 6, 1880. This was the first demonstration that a protozoan could cause disease in humans. Although initially met with hesitation in some scientific circles, his findings gained wide acceptance as other researchers replicated the observations, and later work by Sir Ronald Ross established the mosquito as the transmission vector. After returning to France, Laveran continued his research at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, where he broadened his investigations to other protozoan diseases such as trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) and leishmaniasis. His work played a key role in shaping the emerging field of tropical medicine.

25,2025,The Hindu,25,"Camillo Golgi and Santiago Ramón y Cajal: Nobel Prize-winning pioneers who described the nervous systemPremium Though divided by fierce scientific rivalry — Golgi defending the idea of a continuous nerve network, Cajal championing the “neuron doctrine”, their discoveries together reshaped biology. Golgi’s revolutionary staining method revealed the hidden architecture of nerve cells, while Cajal’s interpretations proved that the nervous system was made of individual units: neurons. Their Nobel Prize marked not only a clash of ideas but the birth of modern neuroscience, and its impact extends to global health, neurology, psychiatry and public policy even today. Camillo Golgi was born on July 7, 1843, in Corteno, Italy. From modest beginnings, he studied medicine at the University of Pavia and began his career as a physician in psychiatric and hospital wards. With limited resources, he improvised laboratory space in his own kitchen. Out of these unassuming beginnings came one of the most transformative methods in biology: the silver chromate stain (a chemical reaction used to create a brick-red or brown-black color to make certain things, especially cells, visible under a microscope). Santiago Ramón y Cajal, born on May 1, 1852, in Petilla de Aragón, Spain, was raised under the stern discipline of his physician father. A gifted illustrator who once dreamed of becoming an artist, he redirected his talents toward science. His eye for detail and artistic hand later gave rise to some of the most iconic images in the history of medicine: the first clear drawings of neurons. In 1873, Golgi developed thereazione nera— the “black reaction.” The method impregnated a small fraction of nerve cells with silver chromate, revealing their entire shape under the microscope: cell body, dendrites, and axon. For the first time, the nervous system was visible not as a blur but as a forest of branching, living structures. A human neocortical pyramidal neuron stained via Golgi technique.

26,2025,The Hindu,26,"All you need to know about: metabolic healthPremium Metabolism today is recognised as one of the strongest indicators of overall health. It governs how the body uses energy, maintains hormonal balance and supports vital functions. When metabolic processes remain efficient, the body is better protected from disease. When they weaken, several health issues begin to surface. Many conditions that are now common—such as type 2 diabetes, fatty liver, hypertension, obesity and PCOS—share a common root in metabolic imbalance. What makes this especially important is how quietly these changes develop. Early signs are often subtle, appearing as low energy, irregular sleep, increased appetite or gradual weight gain. Because these symptoms feel routine, they are often overlooked. Daily lifestyle patterns have a major influence on metabolic health. Long hours of sitting, irregular meal timings, excessive processed foods and inadequate sleep gradually push the body into a state of poor energy regulation. Over time, this affects blood sugar control, fat distribution and inflammation levels, creating a higher risk for chronic illness. On a positive note,  metabolic health responds well to steady, practical changes. A  balanced approach to food, regular movement, and consistent sleep routines help the body use energy more effectively. Awareness also plays a key role—individuals who recognise their risk factors are able to make timely adjustments long before disease sets in. Routine health assessments further support early detection and prevention. Ultimately, metabolic health is shaped by  choices made every day. Improving  metabolic health does not require dramatic changes, but it does require a conscious shift towards healthier routines that support the body’s natural rhythm. A simple reminder captures this approach well: Think healthy, build steady habits, nourish the body wisely, sleep well, stay informed and stay proactive.

Despite this, most diagnoses still rely on conventional tools and tests which often detect the disease only after significant damage has occurred.

Metabolomic profiling, the large-scale study of these molecules, allows researchers to detect subtle changes in the body’s chemistry that may precede disease. Using advanced techniques like liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, scientists can analyse hundreds of metabolites from a single blood sample. In the recent study, researchers used dried blood spots, a simple finger-prick method, to collect samples from 52 individuals, including healthy participants, diabetics, and those with diabetic kidney disease (DKD).

33,2025,The Hindu,33,"Desk-bound employees increasingly prone to frozen shoulder, say expertsPremium Frozen shoulder -- medically known as adhesive capsulitis -- affects an estimated 2–5% of the general population and is significantly more common among individuals with diabetes. Despite its prevalence, experts warn that early symptoms are often subtle and easily overlooked. Many patients assume shoulder pain requires a fall, injury or heavy exercise to be taken seriously, but specialists emphasise that this is incorrect. The condition frequently develops quietly in everyday environments, especially among desk-bound workers whose routines restrict shoulder movement for long hours. A mid-30s Chennai-based IT professional experienced this pattern in a way orthopaedic experts say is becoming increasingly  typical. His workdays -- 10 to 12 hours at a laptop, gradually led to night pain and mild difficulty lifting his arm. He ignored these early signs for nearly two months. By the time he sought medical attention, “the shoulder was already in the frozen stage,” recounts Kalaivanan Kanniyan, senior consultant orthopaedic surgeon, SIMS Hospital, Chennai. Though he eventually recovered with physiotherapy and ergonomic corrections, the process took several months. According to Dr. Kalaivanan, this underscores why unexplained shoulder pain needs timely evaluation: early intervention could have prevented progression. Experts widely note that the public often associates frozen shoulder with a major injury, but this assumption delays care. “Honestly, many people get frozen shoulder without any big trigger,” says Dr. Kalaivanan. Limited arm movement in daily life can slowly inflame and tighten the shoulder capsule. Even mild pain, if it leads to avoiding movement can accelerate stiffness. Chetan Shashikant Pophale, senior consultant, spine surgeon, Apollo Speciality Hospitals, OMR, Chennai, adds that in a large share of cases the problem starts simply because the shoulder is not taken through its full range for long periods. “Even slight posture-related strain, diabetes, thyroid ",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/desk-bound-employees-increasingly-prone-to-frozen-shoulder-say-experts/article70344359.ece

But if the digestive tract isn’t as healthy as it should be, it could cause a number of issues. One condition pertaining to the digestive tract, is Crohn’s disease. And this week being marked as awareness week for Crohn’s, here is all you need to know about it. Crohn’s disease is a long-term condition in which the digestive tract becomes swollen and inflamed. The digestive tract is the long, hollow tube from the mouth to the anus, comprising the esophagus, stomach, small intestine and large intestine. While Crohn’s disease can affect in part of the digestive tract, it is most often the small and large intestine that are affected. Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are two common conditions that fall under the category ofinflammatory bowel disease. Crohn’s disease is named after Burrill B. Crohn, an American gastroenterologist who first described the condition in 1932, along with his colleagues,  Leon Ginzburg and Gordon D. Oppenheimer. The type of Crohn’s disease depends on which part of the digestive system is affected. In ileocolitis, the most common form, the end or lower part of the small intestine and part of the large intestine are affected. Ileitis affects only the ileum or small intestine, while colitis affects only the large intestine (colon). Gastroduodenal is when the stomach and the beginning of the small intestine (duodenum) are affected. In jejunitis, the upper half of the small intestine (jejunum) is affected, while in perianal disease, there is inflammation around the anus. The exact cause of Crohn’s disease is not fully understood as yet, but researchers believe several factors may play a role in its development. It is thought that the disease may be linked to the immune system: a normal immune system reaction triggers inflammation that eventually goes away, but in atypical reaction, bacteria that is normally found in the",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/all-you-need-to-know-about-crohns-disease/article70338072.ece

The five-year, $2.5 billion agreement with Kenya was signed on Thursday (December 4, 2025) by Kenyan President William Ruto and Secretary of State Marco Rubio to replace a patchwork of previous health agreements that had traditionally been run by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) for decades until the Trump administration dismantled it earlier this year. The elimination of USAID as a separate agency sparked widespread criticism and concern in the global health community as its immediate impact resulted in the defunding of multiple hundreds of programmes focused on the developing world, including cuts to maternal and child care, nutrition and anti-HIV/AIDS programmes. Mr. Rubio said the agreement with Kenya “aims to strengthen U.S. leadership and excellence in global health while eliminating dependency, ideology, inefficiency, and waste from our foreign assistance architecture.” He also praised Kenya for its role in leading and contributing to the international stabilisation force working to combat powerful gangs in Haiti. Mr. Ruto lauded the agreement and said Kenya would continue to play a role in Haiti as the gang suppression force transitions to a broader operation. Under the health deal with Kenya, the U.S. will contribute $1.7 billion of the total amount, with the Kenyan government covering the remaining $850 million. The agreement focuses on preventing and treating diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis with an emphasis on faith-based medical providers, although all clinics and hospitals enrolled in Kenya's health insurance system will be eligible to receive funding, according to U.S. officials. “This cooperation framework is quite a departure from th",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-kenya-sign-first-of-what-are-expected-to-be-dozens-of-america-first-global-health-deals/article70360374.ece

On the flip side, deaths due tonon-communicable diseases (NCDs) now account for two-thirds of global mortality. India is among the countries where  top NCD killers are ischaemic heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, and mental health disorders According to the GBD Study 2023, published recently inThe Lancetand theJournal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC), ischaemic (low supply of blood to a body part, leading to a lack of oxygen and nutrients for tissues and cells) heart disease was the leading cause of death in 2023. In the 2023 list of fatal diseases, stroke took the third spot, followed by lower respiratory infections and diabetes. Lower respiratory infections occupied the third spot, stroke the fourth, ischaemic heart disease the fifth, and diabetes the 20th on the 1990 chart. The study noted the fall in the global mortality rates, but flagged the rise in health inequalities and chronic lifestyle-related diseases. “The rapid growth in the world’s ageing population and evolving risk factors have ushered in a new era of global health challenges.

Lenacapavir, which is taken twice a year, has been shown to reduce the risk of HIV transmission by more than 99.9 %, making it functionally akin to a powerful vaccine. In South Africa, where one in five adults lives with HIV, a Wits University research unit oversaw the rollout as part of an initiative funded by the international health agency Unitaid, which works on ensuring equitable access to medical innovations. ""The first individuals have begun using lenacapavir for HIV prevention in South Africa... making it among the first real-world use of the six-monthly injectable in low- and middle-income countries,"" Unitaid said in a statement. The implementation study would enrol 2,000 people and ""follow them for at least a year to understand how this prevention option works in real life"", explained the Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute (RHI)'s Saiqa Mullick. A broader national rollout is expected next year, starting with 400,000 doses that would be received through an international group, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, Mullick said. Neighbouring Zambia and Eswatini received 1,000 doses last month as part of a U.S. programme and launched the drug at World AIDS Day ceremonies on Monday. In Eswatini's Hhukwini constituency, dozens lined up for the shot at a lively public event filled with song and dance.

38,2025,The Hindu,38,"Robert Koch’s Nobel Prize: winning discoveries on tuberculosis and the foundations of bacteriologyPremium In 1905, German physician and microbiologist Robert Koch was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine “for his investigations and discoveries in relation to tuberculosis.” At a time when TB claimed millions of lives, Koch’s identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis as the causative agent transformed medical science and confirmed that the disease was infectious, not hereditary. The discovery not only guided prevention and treatment but also shaped public health strategies worldwide. Robert Koch was born on December 11, 1843, in Clausthal, a mining town in the Harz Mountains of Germany. A precocious child, he taught himself to read by age five and later studied medicine at the University of Göttingen, where pathologist Jacob Henle, an early proponent of germ theory left a lasting influence. After graduating in 1866, Koch worked as a country doctor and briefly served as a military physician during the Franco-Prussian War. Without access to formal laboratory facilities, he built his own microscopes and equipment, devising simple but effective methods that foreshadowed his breakthroughs in microbiology. Koch’s first great success came in 1876, when he identified Bacillus anthracis as the cause of anthrax. He introduced new methods to culture bacteria in pure form using gelatin and later agar, and developed staining techniques to make microbes visible under the microscope. From these experiments, he formulated Koch’s postulates, four criteria to establish a causal link between a microorganism and a disease. These postulates provided microbiology with its first rigorous framework, which continues to influence infectious disease research today, though adapted for viruses and molecular methods. Koch’s most celebrated discovery came in 1882. In a landmark lecture to the Berlin Physiological Society, he announced that he had identified the tubercle bacillus (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) as the cause of tuberculosis.

40,2025,The Hindu,40,"Malaria parasites corkscrew their way deeper through skinPremium Helical paths are everywhere in the microscopic realm. Many bacteria and parasites don’t simply swim or glide in straight lines. In three dimensions, they trace corkscrew-like tracks through their surroundings. Malaria parasites, for example, glide through soft 3D gels and, in the skin of a bitten host, on paths that look like stretched springs. For any such organism, the main challenge is noise. Random bursts of energy from their environment and fluctuations in their own force-generating machinery constantly try to twist it off course. Classic work onEscherichia colibacteria has shown that a bacterium can lose its orientation within about a second because of rotational diffusion, i.e. collisions with surrounding molecules that slowly yet surely randomise its direction. Yet malaria parasites and other similar microorganisms must stay roughly on track for tens of seconds or more if they’re to find nutrients and — in the parasite’s case — a blood vessel. Earlier physical models typically described such microorganisms as self-propelled ‘beads’ buffeted by random noise. These models were mostly two-dimensional; sometimes they added a simple, constant torque to make the beads circle around. However they didn’t fully treat 3D helical motion in the presence of noise that had a memory, which is to say noise whose present value depends on its recent past. At the same time, geometry-based work on malaria parasites had shown how their curved, rod-like shape and flexibility helped them loop around obstacles and structures like blood vessels, but without describing how they could move that way in detail. A new study by Heidelberg University researchers may have bridged this gap. They observed malaria parasites gliding through synthetic hydrogels and then reconstructed their paths using a model, publishing their findings inNature Physicson November 24. “Our new investigations show that malaria parasites move almost exclusively on right-handed helices in 3D environments,” Ulrich S",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/malaria-parasites-corkscrew-their-way-deeper-through-skin/article70352877.ece

Perhaps its scourge may be behind us now as a new scientific breakthrough seems to have cracked the physics of the incessantdrip-drip. A new paper published inPhysical Review Lettershas explained how a water jet breaks up into unstoppable droplets. Researchers from the University of Amsterdam found that the disturbances that trigger the breakup of ‘laminar jets’, i.e. the arc-shaped stream of liquids, into droplets are not caused by external noise or dysfunctional nozzles but by “thermal capillary waves”. Simply speaking, the team found that even when a jet is isolated from external noise, it will still have heat-driven capillary waves. The source of the heat is random thermal motion in the liquid. These waves act like ‘seed’ disturbances and have an amplitude of about one ångström, or one ten-billionth of a metre. They eventually grow and make the jet break into droplets. This is no frivolous finding: per the paper, it could have several application in areas involving droplet formation, such as inkjet printing, food technology, aerosol drug delivery, and DNA sampling.",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/why-do-faucets-drip/article70348866.ece

On the sizzling tawa, the batter meets the heat with a hiss as a ladleful is spread into a circle. A cracked egg follows, gently melding into the surface. Then comes the star  — a spoonful of tender, spicy mutton curry — spread evenly across the top. A drizzle of oil runs around the edges, and after a few minutes of slow roasting, the dosa emerges perfectly balanced — crisp on the edges, soft at the centre,  bursting with flavour. Served hot on the banana leaf, the kari dosa goes well with a side of spicy mutton offal  gravy. The true Madurai way to enjoy it is to tear off a piece of the dosa along with the mutton, let it soak in the spicy gravy, and then take a hearty bite. The crisp edges of the dosa, the soft centre infused with egg, and the rich   masala and pepper-laced flavours of the mutton come together in a  a perfect balance of heat, texture, and comfort. This iconic kari dosa traces its origin to Konar Kadai, an eatery in Madurai that began nearly 90 years ago.

The government's retraction came hours after reports first circulated about the designation, which was an error made “before reviewing,"" according to a statement. The initial decision, published in the official Iraqi gazette on November 17, had placed the two groups — both allies of Iran and also Iraq's Shiite militias — among 24 organisations targeted under a national asset freeze order, accusing them of “participating in committing a terrorist act.” Iraq is under increasing pressure from the United States to clamp down on local Iran-backed militias. Baghdad is also struggling to balance its relations with Washington and Tehran, amid fears of a new Israel-Iran war that could spill over into neighbouring countries. “The names of Hezbollah and the Houthis will be removed"" in a corrected publication of the official gazette, the government said. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani ordered an investigation into the error. Two Iraqi officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue, said the reversal of the designation was the result of a pressure campaign by Iran-aligned political factions and armed groups in Iraq. The factions accused the government of targeting regional allies and risking a confrontation with Tehran, the officials said. The designation also drew condemnation from much of the Iraqi public that supports the Palestinians and sees Hezbollah and the Houthis as resistance movements against Israel.

45,2025,The Hindu,45,"Why does India need bioremediation? | Explained Human waste is leading to a decaying world where access to clean air, water or soil is becoming increasingly difficult. The solution is two-pronged - stop making more waste and clean up the waste already made. Bioremediation literally means “restoring life through biology.” It harnesses microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, algae and plants to sequester or transform toxic substances such as oil, pesticides, plastics, or heavy metals. These organisms metabolise these pollutants as food, breaking them down into harmless by-products such as water, carbon dioxide, or organic acids. In some cases, they can convert toxic metals into less dangerous forms that no longer leach into the soil or groundwater. There are two broad types: In situ bioremediation,where treatment happens directly at the contaminated site — think oil-eating bacteria sprayed on an ocean spill. Ex situ bioremediation,where contaminated soil or water is removed, treated in a controlled facility, and returned once cleaned. Modern bioremediation combines traditional microbiology with cutting-edge biotechnology. First, new biotechnologies are enabling humans to gain unprecedented insight into biology, allowing them to identify biomolecules with useful characteristics. Second, these technologies allow humans to replicate these biomolecules under desired conditions of use, such as sewage plants or agricultural lands. For example, genetically modified (GM) microbes are designed to degrade tough chemicals like plastics or oil residues that natural species struggle with. Synthetic biology also allows for “biosensing”,  organisms that change colour or fluorescence when they detect toxins, providing early warnings of contamination.

Although pollution has been reducing, rivers such as the Ganga and Yamuna receive untreated sewage and industrial effluents daily.

The new research, publishedineBioMedicine, part of The LancetDiscovery Science, has identified specific genetic markers that significantly increase susceptibility to oral cavity cancer, one of the most common and preventable cancers in India, primarily linked to tobacco use. The Genome-Wide Association study (GWAS) was done by researchers at Centre for Cancer Epidemiology (CCE), ACTREC. Researchers compared 2,160 cases of Buccal Mucosa cancer with 2,325 controls from various geographical regions in India and conducted a genome-wide scan to understand the role of genetic susceptibility in the development of oral cancer. They discovered genetic risk loci on chromosomes 5 and 6, near the genes CLPTM1L-TERT, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQB1, and CEP43. Additionally, a meta-analysis that included data from Europe and Taiwan identified novel risk loci near the NOTCH1 gene. The investigators calculated a polygenic risk score and found that tobacco chewers with a high polygenic risk score (indicating higher genetic susceptibility) developed Buccal Mucosa cancer 10 years earlier than those with a low polygenic risk score. In India, there are around 1,41,342 cases of oral cancer, with an average age-standardised rate of 10.0 per 1,00,000 people. In some states, this rate ranges from 25 to 33 per 100,000. Despite similar lifestyle factors, the onset and progression of the disease can vary significantly among individuals.

Researchers from the Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences (BSIP), an autonomous body under the Department of Science and Technology (DST), found a bamboo stem with unusual markings in silt-rich deposits along the Chirang River in Imphal Valley. Their detailed analysis identified these as thorn scars, prompting further investigation into its identity and significance, it said. The team studied the fossil's morphology — including nodes, buds and thorn scars — in the laboratory and assigned it to the genus Chimonobambusa. Comparisons with living thorny bamboos such asBambusabambosandChimonobambusa callosahelped reconstruct the plant’s defensive traits and ecological role. ""This is the first fossil evidence that thorniness in bamboo—a defence against herbivores—was already present in Asia during the Ice Age. Its preservation is particularly significant because it comes from a period of colder and drier global climates, when bamboo was wiped out in many other regions, including Europe.

The Burtele Foot, so named because the bones were found at a site called Burtele in northeastern Ethiopia’s Afar region, showed that this species was bipedal but still had an opposable big toe, a feature useful for tree climbing - evidence that while it walked upright it did so in a different manner than people today. The fossils show that two closely related hominins - species in the human evolutionary lineage - lived at the same time and place, withAustralopithecus afarensisas the other species. This raised the question of whether these close cousins leveraged the same resources or were sufficiently different as to avoid direct competition. A. afarensisis the species that includes the famous fossil Lucy, discovered in 1974 in the Afar region. The new findings add depth to the understanding of this period of human evolution, long before our speciesHomo sapiensarose roughly 300,000 years ago. “They provide us with the most conclusive evidence showing thatA. afarensis- Lucy’s species - was not the only human ancestor that lived between 3.5 and 3.3 million years ago,” said paleoanthropologist Yohannes Haile-Selassie, director of Arizona State University’s Institute of Human Origins and lead author of the study published this week in the journalNature. “As a result, we now know that the earlier phases of our evolution were not linear, meaning only one species living at any given time,” Haile-Selassie said.

The rupee fell to 89.92 after the policy decision was announced, down from 89.78 before the announcement. The rupee has declined 5% over the year so far and is Asia’s worst-performing currency. Weakness in trade and capital flows has bogged down the rupee this year, with the drag compounded by steep U.S. trade tariffs, pushing the currency below the 90 per dollar mark. A majority of economists in a Reuters poll conducted ahead of last week’s gross domestic product data had expected the repo rate to be lowered by a quarter point at the policy meeting, followed by a pause through 2026. However, some analysts and market participants had pared rate cut bets after data showed the South Asian economy expanded at a sharper-than-expected clip of 8.2% in the July-September quarter. The RBI also took steps to boost liquidity in country’s banking sector to support what the Governor Sanjay Malhotra defined as a “goldilocks economy”.",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/indian-rupee-us-dollar-rbi-monetary-policy-on-december-5-2025/article70360457.ece

52,2025,The Hindu,52,"One-atom experiment settles Einstein’s challenge in Bohr’s favourPremium In the 1920s, Albert Einstein proposed a twist on the double-slit experiment. Rather than a wall with two fixed slits, he imagined a very light slit that would recoil when a single photon passed through it. If one could measure that recoil, one could in principle tell which path the photon took. At the same time, one could also look for an interference pattern, which is a sign that light behaves like a wave. Einstein hoped this would show a conflict inside quantum theory itself. Niels Bohr however argued that the plan would fail. For almost a century, the argument stayed on paper because nobody had a way to test the idea. A new study by University of Science and Technology of China researchers has now realised a way, by replacing the movable slit with a single atom. The findings were published inPhysical Review Letterson December 2. A focused laser beam held the atom in place. The researchers cooled the atom close to its ground state, where its random motion was as small as quantum physics allowed. In this state, the uncertainty in the atom’s momentum is similar to the momentum of a single photon. The idea was to check whether the atom’s recoil could be used to say which way a photon went and how that information affected the interference pattern. In the study team’s setup, a photon scattered off the trapped atom in a way that defined two possible paths, which were then recombined to form bright and dark fringes on a detector. At the same time, the photon gave the atom a small ‘kick’ upwards or downwards, depending on the path. Thus, knowing more about the atom’s recoil told the team more about which path the photon took. By tweaking the beam’s strength, the team could tune the atom’s momentum uncertainty. When the uncertainty was large, the two recoil states overlapped and it became impossible to tell which path the photon took, yet the interference pattern was sharp. When the uncertainty was small, the recoil was distinct but the interference became less visible.

The work, led by French virologistsFrançoise Barré-SinoussiandLuc Montagnierat the Institut Pasteur, was the first glimpse of what would become one of the most devastating pathogens in modern human history. At the time, neither Barré-Sinoussi nor Montagnier knew that they had isolated the emperor of all viruses. In the years that followed, it became tragically clear the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), as it came to be known, was not ordinary. Patients who acquired HIV did not recover and every attempt to create a vaccine failed. If left untreated, the infection had a near-100% mortality rate, relentlessly destroying the immune system and leaving patients vulnerable to fatal opportunistic infections. Today, more than four decades later, while HIV is no longer a death sentence, it remains far from cured. The virus has merely transitioned from a guarantee of death to a lifelong, tightly managed chronic illness. Survival today depends on strict, uninterruptedantiretroviral therapy— a regimen that comes with side effects and imposes the constant psychological burden of adherence, since any lapse risks viral rebound, with the added danger of the development of drug resistance. Thus after 42 years of unprecedented investment of time, money, and scientific effort, we are left with a rather abysmal report card. There is stillno vaccine. And of theestimated 91.4 million peoplewho have ever been infected with HIV, only ahandful of individualshave been declared “cured”.

Of this about 10,000 m3, less than 5% by volume but containing most of the radioactivity, needs deep, long-term geological storage in the form of geological disposal facilities (GDFs). These caverns purpose-built hundreds of metres underground are packed with waste containers, cement backfill, and a suitable host rock such as clay. Cement plays several roles in these facilities, including holding waste in place, supporting tunnels and vaults, and helping slow the movement of radioactive elements if groundwater ever gets in. Conventional Portland cement has a very high pH, above 12, which is good for strength and for trapping many radionuclides, but it also creates problems. When water is exposed to this cement it becomes very alkaline itself, and thus able to corrode steel and aluminium, produce hydrogen gas, and damage clay barriers like bentonite by weakening their ability to absorb fluids. To avoid creating such problems in the repository, engineers have developed low-pH cements with porewater pH closer to 10–11. These mixes reduce the amount of ordinary Portland cement and add materials such as silica fume and blast furnace slag, producing calcium-silicate-hydrate gels. One such formulation, known as the CEBAMA mix, has emerged as a strong candidate for use in European disposal concepts. It has a lower pH with a favourable mechanical performance and chemical compatibility with clays and host rocks. However, there are still important questions about how CEBAMA will evolve over many centuries — due to chemical influences as well as in the presence of microbes that live in alkaline and low oxygen environments. Microbial activity in cements is a famously double-edged sword: microbes can corrode concrete in structures like sewers even as certain bacteria can spur a process called microbially induced carbonate precipitation (MICP).

56,2025,The Hindu,56,"The science, technology, and pitfalls of using nuclear power in spacePremium The US recently announced plans under its Lunar Fission Surface Power Project to deploy asmall nuclear reactor on the moonby the early 2030s. It could be the first attempt to establish a permanent nuclear power source beyond earth orbit, signalling the start of a new era in space. While solar energy can power some simple moon-based activities, it’s constrained by the two-week-long lunar nights and the scarcity of sunlight at the poles. For a sustained moon and Mars presence, humans’ energy independence thus becomes a critical enabler. This is also why the US’s lunar nuclear programme is notable. In conversations on this topic on the earth, nuclear power often features as an alternative that is compact, dense, and reliable. Devices called radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) have powered the Voyager spacecrafts’ odyssey through the solar system. They convert heat released by the slow decay of plutonium-238 nuclei into electricity, and are immune to dust and darkness. But RTGs only produce a few hundred watts of electric power, enough for instruments but insufficient for human habitats or industrial operations. Compact fission reactors are the next leap. About the size of a shipping container, these reactors can generate tens to hundreds of kilowatts, and can power life support, laboratories, and manufacturing units. The next leap on the demand side will be industrial operations like in-situ resource utilisation, which can convert Martian water ice into rocket fuel and oxygen, which need over 1 MW of continuous power. Sunlight alone can’t reliably supply this magnitude beyond the earth’s orbit. This is where nuclear power reactors are attractive. On Mars, reactors buried beneath the regolith could take advantage of the natural shielding to protect equipment and inhabitants from cosmic radiation while producing large amounts of energy. The idea of deploying such reactors on the moon itself is lucrative, where they can help maintain warm habitats for explorers,",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/lunar-fission-nuclear-power-in-space-india-opportunities/article70342916.ece

58,2025,The Hindu,58,"Why do we feel the need to go to the bathroom when we’re nervous or scared?Premium When you’re nervous or scared, your body enters its fight-or-flight mode, controlled by the autonomic nervous system. Adrenaline levels rise, your heart races, palms sweat, and blood flow and muscle tone are redistributed to prepare you to act. Your bladder and bowels are controlled by smooth muscle and sphincters. Stress hormones can make the bladder muscle more irritable and can loosen the sphincter. Thus you may feel your bladder is fuller than it really is or that you’re closer to leaking. Similarly, anxiety can change the pattern of contractions in the intestines and sometimes speed up movement in certain segments, producing cramps and an urgent need to pass stool. Many researchers believe that among animals, emptying the bladder or bowels could make the body slightly lighter and more agile and may also remove internal distractions so that an animal can focus on escaping or fighting. Even if this logic isn’t complete, the fact remains that evolution has tolerated clearing waste under acute stress over a long time. Anxiety also changes how you pay attention to bodily sensations. Sensations from the bladder and gut that you’d normally ignore become harder to do so. In people with chronic anxiety, signals travel back and forth along nerves such as the vagus nerve and stress hormones influence how sensitive the intestines are. This is one reason irritable bowel syndrome often flares when a person is stressed: there may be more gas and more cramps even without an infection.",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/why-do-we-feel-the-need-to-go-to-the-bathroom-when-were-nervous-or-scared/article70348530.ece

In front of a big Gabba crowd in Brisbane, the hosts took on the attack with a slew of boundaries as they chase England’s first-innings 334. Weatherald, in only his second Test, slammed 10 fours and a six as he made a composed maiden Test half-century. Head, Australia’s wrecking-ball hero in the first Test at Perth, was the only wicket to fall, out for 33, with Marnus Labuschagne alongside Weatherald on 27. It left Australia trailing by 204 after England were dismissed in the second over of the day with Joe Root unbeaten on 138. They resumed on 325-9 after Root guided them from a precarious 5-2 with his maiden century on Australian soil and 40th overall in a gripping day one. He added nine to the overnight score with partner Jofra Archer before the number 11 fell for a career-best 38, caught spectacularly by a diving Labuschagne in the deep off Brendan Doggett. It ended a valuable 10th-wicket partnership of 70 -- a record for England at the Gabba.

A staggering 33 lakh people were affected at the peak of the flood in Bihar. Indeed, the Kosi River breaches the walls of its embankmentevery few years, imperilling lives and livelihoods, and earning it the name ‘river of sorrow.’ In the eastern Gangetic plains and the adjoining floodplains, rivers have overflowed during the monsoons for centuries, causing catastrophic floods. The Kosi originates in Tibet and Nepal and later joins the Ganga in Bihar. Often called “saptaKosi” because of its seven tributaries, it is a fragile and dynamic river that naturally carries large quantities of sediment. Over the years, the river has shifted its course by several kilometres, subsequently triggering floods. According to a report of the People’s Commission on the Kosi basin, an independent commission, the river has moved 120 km westwards in the last 250 years due to a heavy natural sedimentation process. Experts suggest the construction of a barrage in Nepal in the 1950s, followed by an embankment in Bihar, has significantly altered the river’s natural flow. Embankments are artificial structures made of earth, stone or concrete, designed to control water flow in flood-prone areas. These structures are made to endure the effects of gravity, water pressure, and other external forces and are expected to remain stable over time. While they are often promoted as an ideal solution to protect settlements and enhance agriculture, experts have long warned of their limitations. In 1951, the G.R.

That’s how India’s biodiverse semi-aridgrasslandsand savannas have been undervalued ever since the British colonial era. For the masters, the woody forests of the subcontinent fuelled industrialisation, while the grassy biomes served no purpose in their timber-driven colonisation. Much of post-independence policy and jurisprudence drew heavily from the erstwhile rulers and “wastelands” made their way into land records and government policy. In 1985, a National Wastelands Development Board was created to bring a more scientific basis “to identify, classify and develop the wastelands” towards more productive uses. Ravines, scrub lands, degraded scrub forests, degraded pastures, grazing lands, barren rocky areas, glaciers and snow-covered mountains, along with mining or industrial wasteland and degraded plantation land, were all classified aswastelands. For decades, studies have shown that far from being a wasteland, these savanna grasslands are flourishing ecosystems that not only harbour unique biodiversity but also provide livelihoods to millions of pastoral communities. TakeMaharashtra, for instance. The State’s livestock economy was valued at over ₹59,000 crore in 2018-2019, and that’s just one year. Grasslands play a crucial role in building and maintaining healthy soils, primarily through their deep, fibrous root systems that stabilise the ground, enhance soil structure, and promote long-term carbon storage. Unlike forests, where most biomass is above ground, grassland productivity is concentrated below ground, creating dense root mats that improve water infiltration, reduce erosion, and buffer soils against drought. These roots continually deposit organic matter, enriching soils with stable carbon compounds that can persist for centuries. Grassland soils also support diverse microbial and fungal communities that drive nutrient cycling and maintain soil fertility.

Speaking at the Reuters NEXT conference in New York, Robby Stein, vice president of product for Google Search, addressed concerns that the company’s efforts to provide more AI-powered features — which deliver direct answers to queries — would reduce traffic to external websites. “Google sends billions and billions and billions of clicks out every single day, and the outbound clicks are largely stable. So that’s actually not changing,” Stein said, adding that new ways people are searching, such as using their phone cameras or asking long, complex questions, are creating new opportunities. “We think over time that’s expansionary. The pie is growing very, very fast.” Stein also sought to allay investor concerns that a shift to conversational AI could disrupt Google’s lucrative advertising model. He compared the current transition to the migration from desktop to mobile, saying advertising will evolve to fit the new format. Ads in an AI chat experience can be “incredibly helpful,” he said, citing an example of a user with a raccoon problem being offered relevant products. Stein’s comments came as reports emerged that rival OpenAI had declared a “code red” to improve ChatGPT amid growing competition from Google.

Sound waves pervade our atmosphere and a certain portion of those sound waves are what we refer to as noise (Sounds change into its alter ego ‘noise’ when we, subjectively, don’t want them there or think they are too disruptively chaotic, silly).  But, it is possible to build a temporary reality sans noise. We owe this new reality to the science of noise cancellation. Sound engineers are always looking to make sound more ambitious. It didn’t take them too long to master the art of cancelling noise. In 1934, German inventor Paul Lueg discovered that we could control unwanted sounds. That is, if a sound wave is unwanted, it could be muted by the introduction of an opposing sound wave of the same frequency which cancels that wave. Sound engineers are always looking to make sound more ambitious.

You might have often seen the acronym in headphone ads. By the 1950s, the active noise cancellation method was properly researched and getting implemented. Shortly thereafter, ANC became the state of the art, crucially commercialised by headset companies. There are three major components that make noise cancellation work. They are: 1. Microphones These do the job of detecting target sounds from the atmosphere. 2. Processor (processing system) Once the sounds are captured, the processor will analyse the sound. Frequency, magnitude, etc. are calculated and another sound is generated in the opposite phase (inverse wave form). 3.

The MPC also decided to continue with the neutral stance. “For the first time since the adoption of flexible inflation targeting (FIT), average headline inflation for a quarter at 1.7% in Q2:2025-26, breached the lower tolerance threshold (2%) of the inflation target (4%). It dipped further to a mere 0.3% in October 2025. On the other hand, real GDP growth accelerated to 8.2% in Q2, buoyed by strong spending during the festive season which was further facilitated by the rationalisation of the goods and services tax (GST) rates,” Mr. Malhotra said in his address. Inflation at a benign 2.2% and growth at 8%, for the first half of this year presents a rare goldilocks period, Mr. Malhotra added. While stating that globally, contrary to earlier expectations, growth has been relatively strong, he said that evolving geopolitical and trade environments, however, continue to weigh on the outlook. “Inflation paths remain divergent with headline inflation remaining above target in most advanced economies, while pressures in most emerging markets are contained, providing room for accommodative monetary policy.” The Governor noted that conflicting pulls and pressures from AI-fuelled optimism and concerns over high valuations are playing out in global equity markets, while divergence in the monetary policy trajectory of central banks is adding to the uncertainty on capital flows and yield spreads. Taking various factors into account, real GDP for 2025-26 is projected at 7.3% which is 0.5% more than the earlier projection. CPI inflation for 2025-26 is now projected at 2% which is 0.6% downwards from the earlier projection, the Governor said.

If you are unable to do so, the intervention of the court is the only option… You would have to work it out or the court will make the appointment,” Justice Pardiwala, heading a Bench, addressed Attorney General R. Venkataramani, appearing for the Governor, and senior advocate Jaideep Gupta, for the Kerala government, standing on either end of the courtroom. The hearing began with Mr. Venkataramani conveying to the court that the Governor, who is also Chancellor of the two universities, preferred two names, Dr. Ciza Thomas and Dr. Priya Chandran, as Vice Chancellors of APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University and the Kerala University of Digital Sciences, Innovation and Technology, respectively. However,Chief Minister Vijayan did not agree with him. Mr. Venkataramani said his preference was dictated by the fact that Ms. Thomas and Ms. Chandran had commonly figured in the VC panels prepared by both the search committees headed by retired Supreme Court judge, Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia. Mr. Gupta cut in, saying the “Chancellor has agreed to the very two names the Chief Minister has found unacceptable”. The court said the point was to have the most qualified persons appointed as Vice Chancellors. “We want the most meritorious of the names in both the universities,” Justice Pardiwala emphasised.

Festival director Syed Sultan Ahmed stressed the importance of films as a medium to teach life skills in the classroom. The program has a ‘Watch, Learn, Make’ framework that provides a masterclass for children up to class 10, and includes masterclasses for students in acting, cinematography and production. “Films such asPushpa, KGFandAnimalcan exert a negative influence on a child’s behaviour,” says Ahmed. “For this reason, SCIFF takes months to filter through the entries, curating films that showcase moral values and different cultures, ensuring that children are introduced to films best suited for their cognitive development.” A sample of the fare showcased at SCIFF include two animated films,Sullinkayiby Megha Kulkarni andGhughuti Ki Maalaby Ketan Pal.Sullinkayiis humorous, refreshing, and extremely relatable in its message about dates, the dry fruit.

Many parents expose their innocent children on social media platforms, she said.

Since Microsoft's European headquarters are located in Ireland, the DPC is the EU's lead data regulator for the company. The organisation that brought the complaint, Eko, which says it fights for ""people and planet over profits,” accused Microsoft of violating Europe's data protection law.

WhatsApp, owned by Facebook parent Meta Platforms, rolled out its AI chatbot feature for European Union users in March after delays. The Commission, which is the bloc's executive arm, said a recent policy update could mean that rival AI companies are blocked from offering their AI assistants on the platform, while Meta's chatbot service remains accessible to users. Regulators are scrutinising new terms and conditions for business customers, who can use AI assistants to communicate with customers over WhatsApp. Teresa Ribera, the commission's vice president overseeing competition affairs, said the bloc wants to prevent Big Tech companies from boxing out innovative competitors. “This is why we are investigating if Meta’s new policy might be illegal under competition rules, and whether we should act quickly to prevent any possible irreparable harm to competition in the AI space,” she said in a press statement.

This technological leap in quantum computing was called Quantum Echoes. Unlike the 2019 Sycamore experiment, which claimed “quantum supremacy” for completing a random-number task faster than any supercomputer, Quantum Echoes was not a speed race but a test of understanding. Scientists measured out-of-time-order correlators (OTOC) — tiny echoes that reveal how disturbances travel through a network of qubits. The method resembles giving a material a microscopic “poke,” reversing time evolution, and listening for the returning echo. The echo’s strength reveals how quickly information disperses, offering insight for chemistry, materials science, and superconductivity. Despite its scientific importance, the experiment does not bring the world closer to breaking encryption or to Q-day. Q-day refers to the day a cryptographically relevant quantum computer becomes powerful enough to break public-key encryption. It would not instantly expose all secrets, but any encrypted data stored today could be decoded later if intercepted now — a risk known as “harvest now, decrypt later.” Governments and researchers are already preparing. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has standardised new post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms — CRYSTALS-Kyber for encryption and Dilithium for digital signatures. These rely on mathematical problems that are believed to resist both classical and quantum attacks. Experts expect that machines capable of breaking RSA-2048 will need millions of logical qubits, which could take 5 to 8 years to build.

We often talk about social media addiction as if the platforms themselves are pulling every string, but when I’m honest with myself, the behaviour that most reliably brings my phone to my hand is the arrival of a text on WhatsApp. Deep down, my brain responds to the text the way it would to someone tapping me on the shoulder. It feels like a social cue that signals me to reply. And because ignoring a cue like that creates friction, I find myself checking more often than I ever intended to. That stress becomes the gateway to all other distractions. I’ll respond to the message, yes, but then I’ll check one more thing, then another, and before long the entire digital carnival has unfurled itself in front of me. So, here’s how I decided to tackle my own dependency at its root, not by fighting dopamine loops or deleting apps, but by renegotiating my relationship with the device itself. The first rule was to break my “all-day available” habit. This was making me slave to the machine and keeping me on an ‘always ready’ mode to respond to an incoming text. Once I broke this habit by enforcing a time-in and a time-out period, I noticed that my nerves felt cooler. This also made me stop nursing the idea of someone waiting for my response. Then, I stopped carrying the phone around everywhere I go. For instance, when I go for a walk or jog, I don’t take the phone with me anymore. That gives me rough forty-fifty minutes o",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/this-hidden-addiction-keeps-us-glued-to-smartphones-heres-how-to-fix-it/article70356363.ece
83,2025,The Hindu,83,"Russia blocks Apple's FaceTime in mounting push against foreign tech platforms Russia has blocked Apple's video-calling app FaceTime, the state communications watchdog said on Thursday, as part of an accelerating clampdown on foreign tech platforms that authorities allege are being used for criminal activity. The move follows restrictions against Google's YouTube, Meta's WhatsApp and the Telegram messaging service. Critics say the curbs amount to censorship and a tightening of state control over private communications. Russia says they are legitimate law enforcement measures. Russian authorities have this year launched a state-backed rival app called MAX, which critics say could be used for surveillance - allegations that state media have dismissed as false. Justifying its decision, the communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, said in an emailed statement: ""According to law enforcement agencies, FaceTime is being used to organise and carry out terrorist attacks in the country, recruit perpetrators, and commit fraud and other crimes against Russian citizens."" The watchdog did not cite evidence in support of the allegations. Apple representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the blocking of FaceTime, an app that enables users to make free video and audio calls over Wi-Fi or cellular data. Moscow residents who tried FaceTime on Thursday reported seeing an on-screen message saying ""User unavailable"". One said a friend that she tried to contact had seen the incoming call but was unable to connect. In recent months, Roskomnadzor has intensified measures to block access to Western media and tech platforms it says are hosting content that breaches Russian laws. In August, Russia began limiting some calls on WhatsApp and Telegram, accusing them of refusing to share information with law enforcement in fraud and terrorism cases. Roskomnadzor last week threatened to block WhatsApp completely.

For Peter Nikoloff, a different type of sage-making took precedence. He was sure to be first in line Wednesday morning at the most popular booth at Amazon’s annual AWS cloud computing confab in Las Vegas that attracts some 60,000 attendees, paying up to $2,100 each for tickets. Nikoloff, 37, waited nearly two hours to be first in line to make a custom fragrance for his wife using Amazon’s Nova generative AI software. The voice-powered service spun a fragrance with hints of mint, sandalwood and, yes, sage. “Oh it was totally worth it,” said Nikoloff, who was attending the weeklong conference, put on by Amazon Web Services, to pick up tips to help with his information technology job with the federal government. “There’s quite a lot of perfume here, for free.” Sessions dispensing advice on arcane fields such as cloud modernization, data lakes and container migrations are popular among software engineers at the conference, but none has drawn a crowd like the AI perfumery. On the third day of the event, the line for the Fragrance Lab had not abated, drawing upwards of six dozen hopefuls at a time and waits of one hour or more. The scent lab is a gimmick, but meant to demonstrate the broad applications for AI software, Amazon said. Users are guided through a series of voice prompts on a screen that relies on four different AI models -- all Amazon's -- and a scent is generated for human perfumers to prepare. Thirty scents ranging from coffee to tobacco to jasmine can be combined for the final output. Amazon prompts users to describe their favorite activities, preferred environments and other characteristics before spitting out scents that are meant to match the user’s mood and fragrance profile.

The move comes as Microsoft’s suite,which includes Word, Excel and PowerPoint, faces growing competition from Google’s products. The price hike will affect businesses and public sector agencies, with small business and frontline worker plans seeing the sharpest increases. Microsoft 365 Business Basic will rise 16.7% to $7 per user per month, while Business Standard will climb 12% to $14. Enterprise plans will see smaller jumps, with Microsoft 365 E3 up 8.3% at $39 and E5 up 5.3% at $60. Subscriptions for frontline workers will surge by as much as 33%, with Microsoft 365 F1 moving from $2.25 to $3 and F3 from $8 to $10. Government suites will follow a similar trajectory, with changes phased in according to local regulations. The company said the changes reflect more than 1,100 new features added across Microsoft 365, including AI-driven productivity tools and integrated security enhancements.

88,2025,The Hindu,88,"U.S. senators unveil bill to prevent easing of curbs on Nvidia chip sales to China A bipartisan group of U.S. senators, including prominent Republican China hawk Tom Cotton, on Thursday unveiled a bill that would block the Trump administration from loosening rules that restrict Beijing’s access to artificial intelligence chips from Nvidia and AMD for 2.5 years. The bill, known as the SAFE CHIPS Act, was filed by Republican Senator Pete Ricketts and Democrat Chris Coons. It would require the Commerce Department, which oversees export controls, to deny any license requests for buyers in China, Russia, Iran or North Korea to receive U.S. AI chips more advanced than the ones they currently are allowed to obtain for 30 months. After that, Commerce would have to brief Congress on any proposed rule changes a month before they take effect. The legislation, which was co-sponsored by Republican Dave McCormick and Democrats Jeanne Shaheen and Andy Kim, represents a rare effort led in part by Trump’s own party to stop him from further relaxing tech export restrictions on China. “Denying Beijing access to (the best American) AI chips is essential to our national security,” Ricketts said in a statement. The bill comes as the Trump administration mulls greenlighting sales of Nvidia’s H200 artificial intelligence chips to China, Reuters reported. China hawks in Washington fear that Beijing could use the prized chips to supercharge its military with AI-powered weapons and more powerful intelligence and surveillance capabilities. Faced with new Chinese export curbs on the rare earth metals that global tech companies rely on, Trump’s Commerce Department imposed and then rolled back curbs on Nvidia’s H20 AI chips, a move that was criticized by Republican Representative John Moolenaar, who chairs the House China Select Committee.

Facebook, since renamed Meta, announced the Oversight Board, often referred to as the group's ""supreme court"", at a 2018 nadir of public trust in the tech giant. The Instagram and WhatsApp owner's image had been tarnished by episodes like the Cambridge Analytica data-breach scandal and dis- and misinformation around crucial public votes such as Brexit and the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The Oversight Board began its work in 2020, staffed with prominent academics, media veterans and civil society figures. It reviews selected cases where people have appealed against Meta's moderation decisions, issuing binding rulings on whether the company was right to remove content or leave it in place. It also issues non-binding recommendations on how lessons from those cases should be applied to updating the rules for billions of users on Meta's Facebook, Instagram and Threads platforms. Over the past five years, the board has secured ""more transparency, accountability, open exchange and respect for free expression and other human rights on Meta's platforms"", it said in a report. The board added that Meta's oversight model, unusual among major social networks, could be ""a framework for other platforms to follow"". The board, which is funded by Meta, has legal commitments that bosses will implement its decisions on individual pieces of content. But the company is free to disregard its broader recommendations on moderation policy.

They had stopped looking at the sky during winters in their five years of living in Delhi. “Either it was not visible due to the smog or it was this dirty grey,” says the media consultant. They moved cities so that their daughter could breathe easy. Ever since her birth, she would fall sick frequently; by the age of 2, she had three bouts of bronchitis. As parents they did everything they could, from buying air purifiers to restricting outdoor exposure, but herbreathing issues persisted. “By the age of 3, she already knew how to hold the nebuliser,” says Padma Priya, who had to quit her communications job owing to the frequent leaves she needed for managing their daughter’s health. Padma Priya remembers one scary night in 2017, when their daughter was breathless, coughing for over 40 minutes straight. The paediatric pulmonologist recommended steroids and antibiotics and asked the question that changed their life trajectory — is there any way that they could move out of the city? Since their daughter was under the age of five, he told them that her lungs could still recover, else she would develop asthma and need inhalers all her life. The couple took the difficult decision to leave, paring down expenses and opting for a small 2BHK in Hyderabad. “It was a gamble but it was better than getting our daughter susceptible to lifelong breathing issues,” she says. Within a few weeks of moving, the little girl’s health improved. They have never regretted their decision. Six years ago, this kind of move was unheard of. Old-time Delhi residents sneered at those who wore masks due to smog. Now, amid talks of climate change, moving out of the city is becoming a strange new reality.

This weekend, Cyclone Ditwah brought something unexpected to Tamil Nadu’s shore — two female Amur Falcons that were blown off their long migratory course and into Point Calimere (Kodiyakarai). The Amur Falcon, a small raptor that breeds in southeastern Siberia and northern China, is one of the world’s most extraordinary migrants. Each year, it travels nearly 40,000 km, cutting across the Central Asian and West Asian flyways before crossing the Arabian Sea to reach southern Africa. Its typical route through India lies along the Gujarat-Maharashtra corridor. Tamil Nadu’s coast is far outside this path. Yet this is not the first time storms have carried the species Nagappattinam.Point Calimere recorded its first-ever Amur Falconin 2020, after cyclones Nivar and Burevi. In November 2024, two more were sighted during Cyclone Fengal. Now, as Cyclone Ditwah churned across the Bay, two female Amur Falcons appeared once again close to the BNHS Bird Migration Study Centre. S. Sivakumar, Assistant Director, BNHS, said such sightings underline how cyclones alter migratory trajectories. “This is not their regular migratory route. Amur Falcons normally pass through Gujarat and Maharashtra. Strong cyclonic winds can blow them far from their viable path. We first recorded the species here in 2020.

92,2025,The Hindu,92,"Visakhapatnam researchers document unique predatory behaviour of horn-eyed ghost crab In a finding that adds a new layer to the natural history of India’s east coast, researchers from GITAM School of Science, Visakhapatnam, have documented what they describe as the “first confirmed instance” of a horn-eyed ghost crab preying on a mottled lightfoot crab along the Rushikonda shoreline. The observation, recorded during a routine evening field visit in April, opens an unexpected window into the behaviour of a species long assumed to remain within sandy stretches of the intertidal zone. The sighting occurred when Harish Prakash, a faculty member in the Department of Life Sciences at GITAM University, accompanied by researchers Abhisree MK and Rohan Kumar, noticed an unusual movement on the beach at low tide. What at first appeared to be the typical foraging activity of shoreline fauna soon revealed itself to be a rare interaction. A horn-eyed ghost crab, a species widely regarded as a keystone species and indicator of coastal health, was seen handling and consuming a mottled lightfoot crab. The latter is a species that occupies rocky crevices and does not ordinarily cross paths with its sand-dwelling counterpart. Harish explains that the significance of this record lies not only in the act of predation but also in the geographical overlap it implies. “The horn-eyed ghost crab is generally restricted to sandy zones. Its possible presence within the rocky section of the intertidal area indicates a behavioural extension, likely tied to nocturnal foraging,” he says. According to Harish, this is the first documented instance of the species actively hunting this particular crab, which suggests a temporary merging of habitats where sand and stone occur in close succession. The research team believes that such interactions could be limited to these transitional areas, where the rhythm of waves and tides creates mixed terrain.  “Generalist predators, such as ghost crabs, tend to adjust their diet to the availability of prey, which varies across seasons and locatio",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/visakhapatnam-researchers-document-unique-predatory-behaviour-of-horn-eyed-ghost-crab/article70353593.ece

On rare occasions, the second look totally upends conclusions made from the initial glance. That is how a bird record from Adyar Estuary on October 26 underwent a revision. The bird was first believed to be a Dusky Crag Martin, and the photos were squatting in the memory card largely unseen, even less examined. Around a month later, a study of the photos by an eBird reviewer demanded a re-identification of the bird. And as it turned out, what had been seen on the last Sunday of October in 2025 was an altogether different feather, one spiralling into Chennai for the first time. The visitor to the Adyar Estuary, that day, that was mistaken for a Dusky Crag Martin was actually an Indian edible-nest swiftlet (Aerodramus unicolor), also known as the Indian swiftlet. The bird was photographed by Saravana Manian, the sighting taking place in the company of a clutch of other birders.

                                Saravana Manian Saravana Manian points out that Adyar Estuary is an unlikely terrain for the Indian swiftlet.

The bird is also found in Sri Lanka.” Besides hills and mountains, the species is also known to “patronise” buildings abandoned for a long time. Habitats fitting these descriptions are a far cry from what exists in and around the Adyar Estuary, which makes this sighting decidedly baffling. From the viewpoint of probability, the unlikelihood of an Indian swiftlet “vacationing” around the broken bridge in the Adyar Estuary might be of astronomical proportions.

The Ministry also said that the Delhi Jal Board spent about ₹5,536 crore over the past three financial years on efforts to keep the river clean. In a written response to a question in Rajya Sabha, Minister of State for Jal Shakti Raj Bhushan Choudhary said Delhi had a sewage treatment gap of 414 MLD in August 2025, lacked common effluent treatment plants in several approved industrial areas, and continued to face delays in completing and upgrading sewage treatment projects. He added that Delhi generates 11,862 tonnes of solid waste daily but has the capacity to treat only 7,641 tonnes, leaving a gap of 4,221 tonnes. The Minister noted that the Yamuna enters Delhi at Palla, where its water quality fluctuates through the year depending on water availability and catchment discharge.

The story follows Zhou Mingrui, a modern Chinese youth who wakes up in the body of Klein Moretti in a Victorian-era world of secret organisations, occult rituals, and a complex power system. Fans have consistently praised the show for its steampunk worldbuilding, Lovecraftian horrors, and the precision of its adaptation choices — especially in a year when the Disney-killing likes ofNe Zha 2, as well asNobodyandTo Be Hero X, have been pushing Chinese animation to new visibility.

The proposal, Mr. Poojary said in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 24, has already received in-principle approval from the Union Road Transport Ministry, pending a formal declaration. The 170-km stretch, upon being upgraded as an NH, would greatly serve the coastal and Western Ghat regions of Karnataka by way of enhancing connectivity, the MP explained in a letter submitted to Mr. Modi during the latter’s visit to Udupi on November 28.

It would boost tourism in Someshwara, Agumbe, Sringeri and surrounding areas, besides supporting movement of agricultural and commercial goods, he said. Similarly, the Sringeri-Chikkamagaluru (Nadipur) stretch of SH 27 via Agalagandi, Jayapura, Balehonnur and Aldur, would strengthen connectivity to pilgrim centre Sringeri from Bengaluru, and surrounding regions when upgraded as an NH, the MP argued. The stretch has been a vital link between the Western Ghats, religious centres like Sringeri, and commercial and coffeee centres like Balehonnur, the MP stated. The upgradation is crucial for regional connectivity, economic development and public safety as the routes connect key towns, economic zones, historical centres and agricultural belts, Mr. Poojary stated.

Punjab and Haryana recorded a 90% reduction instubble burningincidents this year compared to 2021. In fact, farm fires in the two States declined to their lowest levels in five years in 2025. However,pollution levelsin Delhi remained stubbornly high, triggering protests last month. This disparity shows that local sources remain the primary driver of the capital’s persistent pollution crisis. Notably, the Supreme Court on Monday suggested that farmers could not be made scapegoats for air pollution in the national capital. The Court also asked why blue skies were visible during the pandemic years when stubble burning was relatively high and vehicles were off the roads. The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE)’s assessment of Delhi’s early winter trends and annual air quality confirms this reality: Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) can no longer hide behind the smokescreen of farm fires. The incidence of crop burning has substantially reduced in Punjab and Haryana this year, partly due to the massive floods in Punjab during the monsoon. In the October-November period, the daily contribution of farm fires to pollution levels in Delhi mostly remained below 5%, or between 5-15% for a few days and peaked at 22% only between November 12 and 13. The chart below shows Delhi’s Air Quality Index (left axis) versus contribution of farm fires (right axis: %) in the October-November period While the reduced fires prevented extreme spikes, the Air Quality Index (AQI) stayed in the ‘very poor’ to ‘severe’ range for almost the entire month of November, indicating the significance of Delhi’s local, year-round sources of pollution. Importantly, PM 2.5 remained the prominent pollutant for 34 days in the October-November period. Data show that the air is toxic to breathe not just because of the increase in the levels of particulate matter but also due to the contribution of local sources.

It has served as a barrier to the spread of desertification from the Thar Desert to the Gangetic Plains, guarded Rajasthan’s proudest forts such as Chittorgarh and Ranthambore, and served as the cradle of spirituality for communities across northwest India. The Modi Government has now nearly signed a death warrant for these hills, already denuded by illegal mining. It has declared that any hills in the range with an elevation of less than 100 metres are not subject to the strictures against mining. It is an open invitation for illegal miners and mafias to finish off 90% of the range which falls below the height limit set by the Government. On the northernmost end of the Aravalli range, the national capital has embarked on its annual smog season this month. A hazy mist of dust, smoke and particulate matter has been settling down on millions of citizens as they go about their daily lives breathing in toxic air. Even as the smog becomes a part of our yearly routine, research increasingly shows that it is a full-scale, slow-motion public health tragedy. Estimates of the human toll of this pollution go as high as 34,000 deaths in just 10 cities annually. Last week the news headlines reflected yet another evolving tragedy. The Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) has reported that 13%-15% of tested groundwater samples in Delhi contain uranium beyond the permissible limit for human consumption. Shamefully, water samples from Punjab and Haryana reflect even higher levels of uranium contamination. One does not need to dwell on the frightening health implications that regular consumption of such water for daily activities can have on impacted populations.

It had conducted a dress rehearsal though, shaking the trees with mild intensity.  One knew what was in the offing. And the images of what is to come paraded across the mind’s eye. It would get windier, and under duress, the avenue trees would weep, shedding green tears. An out-of-season shedding — in Chennai, the dry season when deciduous trees relinquish their old rags is still some distance away — it would cause streets to be matted with wet leaves. In the days immediately after the storm, the decaying vegetative matter will be felt by the nostrils of morning walkers. Conservancy workers would sweep in, gather the leaves in small heaps. In some neighbourhoods, the heaps would be promptly carted away in vehicles. In some others, the heaps would tarry a day or two longer, the vehicles not showing up. On five streets in Kotturpuram, one would expect the script to be different and refreshingly distinct. The leaves would not leave the streets. The heaps would be deposited inside 27 leaf litter bins stationed by the five streets, and allowed to turn into compost, with periodic watering by a gardener to aid the composting process. The compost, harvested in cycles, will be distributed to residents, who will use it for their plants, thereby closing the loop. The ready-made plan to deal with leaves that fall to the ground in this neighbourhood is years old, and it was scripted by Nawab Gardens Residents Welfare Association (NGRWA). An initiative started by a resident welfare association can wither away for want of sustained watering particularly when the RWA’s reins have changed hands many a time.

Described in November 2025, the two are among the nearly 40 new species reported from here since 2021.

Naveen and S.R. Chandramouli of Pondicherry University, Zeeshan A. Mirza of the Max Planck Institute for Biology, and naturalist Girish Choure. Given the snake’s rarity, its sharply restricted range and potential threats, the researchers have recommended that it be classified as “Endangered” under the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List criteria. It is from the same east coast of Great Nicobar that birders Pia Sethi and Nitu Sethi from Delhi and Vikram Shil from Port Blair had recently published a paper on the Great Nicobar Crake speciesRallina.Writing in the journalIndian Birds, the authors note that very little is known of the “biology, distribution, or population status” and suggest this could be a new species to science given the “distinctive set of [its] morphological features, including several novel ones”. Great Nicobar is reported to have 650 species of plants and over 1,800 species of fauna. The region also boasts of remarkable genetic biodiversity, exhibiting about 24% endemism among some faunal groups.

It is a reminder of the silent and living resource that sustains life. For 2025, the theme, “Healthy Soils for Healthy Cities”, shifts the focus from the rural farmland to the concrete jungle, highlighting a critical truth — the ground beneath our cities is not mere dirt, but a dynamic ally in building a resilient urban future. With over 56% of the global population now living in cities, urban environments are confronting unprecedented challenges, from food insecurity and pollution to devastating flooding and extreme heat. At the heart of the solution to these issues lies an often-forgotten ally: urban soil. When we think of soil, we picture farms. But our urban soils are silent, unsung heroes. They are living filters, natural sponges and carbon sinks that exist right beneath our parks, street trees and community gardens. Their health is directly linked to the resilience and well-being of our urban populations. A teaspoon of healthy soil contains more organisms than there are people on earth, and this vibrant ecosystem performs extraordinary services. These include: first, combating climate change and extreme heat — urban areas often become “heat islands”, several degrees warmer than their surroundings. Healthy soils, especially when covered with vegetation, absorb heat, sequester atmospheric carbon, and act as natural air conditioners in parks, community gardens, and green medians. Second, preventing floods and managing water — as climate change intensifies rainfall, cities paved with concrete surfacing face frequent flooding. Healthy soil is a city’s first line of defence, acting like a sponge to absorb rainfall, filter it, and replenish groundwater supplies, unlike impermeable surfaces.

Is the apathy reflected in people’s disengagement from inequality, disruption, and social change? Midway through his PhD, Rachit Dubey, now an assistant professor at the department of communication, University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA), “shifted away from traditional cognitive science topics to tackle broader, interdisciplinary challenges around adaptation and climate change,” he wrote in a recent paper inScience. Now, Dr. Dubey continues to pursue the basic science of adaptation through interdisciplinary methods, including behavioural experiments, formal models, and insights from neuroscience, psychology, computer science, and public policy. As he put it, his “goal is to help build that bridge between disciplines and to better understand how human minds (and societies) adapt to change”. Recently Dr. Dubey spoke toThe Hinduabout how extraordinary circumstances start feeling ordinary. Excerpts from an interview follow: You have said crises such as pandemics and climate change have begun to be normalised. Could you elaborate? Normalisation happens when our minds recalibrate to new conditions so quickly that extraordinary circumstances start feeling ordinary. This is a prominent problem when it comes to climate change. What would have been considered absolutely abnormal in the 1990s for example are three major wildfires per year (in California) or extreme air pollution (in Delhi); these are completely normal to someone growing up today. In our narrow window of cognition, with our limited memories and attention spans, climate change produces slow, gradual changes punctuated by occasional disasters. This creates a fundamental mismatch: the last 50-100 years are unprecedented in terms of carbon emissions and rate of warming, but our subjective experience makes it feel incremental.

In this case — as in many States — the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation (TNCSC), which procures paddy on behalf of the Food Corporation of India (FCI), found itself in a spot because of time overruns and charges of corruption. One of the reasons cited is the rise in the coverage of the crop during the season, by about two lakh acres, which was known as early as mid-August. This is because farmers feel it is a safe bet to grow paddy rather than other crops due to minimum assured returns. The glut is not restricted to Tamil Nadu. Going by the data of the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, the procurement of paddy (in terms of rice) all over the country was nearly 119.86 lakh tonnes as on October 31, 2025 compared to 82.08 lakh tonnes on the corresponding day last year. In the last three years, with regard to rice and wheat, the quarterly opening stock position, as on October 1, was consistently higher than what is prescribed under the norms for the central pool. In the case of rice, the quantity is at least two times more than the requirement. In October this year, the stock was 356.1 lakh tonnes against the norm of 102.5 lakh tonnes. Compared to wheat, rice is still abundant, if one goes by the Union government’s data for the last three years on procurement and offtake under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) and other schemes. Between April 2022 and March 2025, the procurement of rice at the all-India level hovered around 525 lakh tonnes-547 lakh tonnes every year, whereas annual offtake under the Public Distribution System (PDS) was in the range of 392 lakh tonnes- 427 lakh tonnes.

115,2025,The Hindu,115,"Honey on highPremium The scent of lavender fills the walkways across 60 hectares of the Field Station, Bonera, in south Kashmir’s Pulwama. The lavender bushes are protected by a tall tree line with thick green foliage at the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research’s Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine (CSIR-IIIM), an affiliate of its Jammu centre. Amid its exotic plants sections are geranium, rosemary, and roses, even blue Italian hibiscus trees. Here, the institute has begun to produce mono-floral lavender honey for the first time ever. This has paved the way for India to join a few Western countries like France, Spain, Italy, Bulgaria, England, and Turkey to enter the global market of premium, sought-after lavender honey. A kilogram of this sells between ₹5,000 and ₹6,000 in the global market, six times higher than the price of regular organic honey. The journey to producing mono-floral lavender honey started in June of 2022 when Shahid Rasool, the principal scientist at CSIR-IIIM’s Field Station in Pulwama observed an increasing number of honey bees foraging for nectar in the vast lavender fields at the Pulwama station. This year, the scientists confirmed through laboratory testing that 61% of pollen concentration was from lavender, a qualification to earn the tag of mono-floral honey. “We were aware of the aromatic and medicinal properties of lavender, but bees spending time on the plant was a hint of the presence of nectar in the crop. This started the dream project of producing lavender nectar-based mono-floral honey,” says Rasool, who works across agro-technology, mountain agriculture and genetic resources. The scientists began testing the honey for high lavender flower pollen concentration to confirm that the honey was mono-floral. “A rigorous scientific process went into authenticating its mono-floral origin. For the first time in India, a honey product has been validated using an integrated suite of technologies including fluorescence and scanning electron microscop",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jammu-and-kashmir/honey-on-high/article69992723.ece

Ganesan, Additional Director of Agriculture. Mr. Ganesan toldThe Hinduthat the department had 2,500 hectares under samba cultivation and another 2,000 hectares was expected to be brought under the crop shortly. “With good water supply from rivers and favourable monsoon so far, conditions are positive for the samba season,” he said. A total of 80 tonnes of urea, 100 tonnes of DAP, and 120 tonnes of potash were available in stock for distribution. “Besides the Agriculture Department’s stock, 15 private dealers and four cooperative societies have been licensed to sell fertilizers,” he said. Farmers had been encouraged to adopt direct sowing wherever possible and the department was in regular touch with cultivators to address field-level requirements promptly. To promote cultivation, subsidy at the rate of ₹10 a kg was being provided for new paddy seed varieties. So far, about 55 tonnes of seeds had been distributed through the Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) and State Seed Farm. Farmers from Scheduled Castes get up to 75% subsidy. This was in addition to ₹5,000 production incentive extended by the Puducherry government. The department had identified 10 clusters covering 200 farmers to promote organic farming of traditional rice varieties across 400 to 600 hectares. Certification work for these clusters was under way. P.G. Somu, joint secretary of the Delta Vivasayigal Sangam (Karaikal chapter), said cultivation was progressing smoothly. “Water availability is good at present, but we are cautious about possible heavy rain in the coming weeks.

120,2025,The Hindu,120,"More women employed in agriculture, but half of them are unpaidPremium Women-led development has been recognised as a structural game-changer for advancing India’s economic ambitions, yet its full potential remains under-leveraged. Nowhere is harnessing this potential more urgently than in the agriculture sector, the backbone of India’s economy and the largest employer of its women. Despite their growing presence on farms, women’s contributions remain systematically unremunerative. By leveraging recent shifts in trade and technology, India has an unprecedented opportunity to unlock pathways that recognise women as equal partners in agricultural transformation. In the past decade, structural shifts in the Indian workforce have drawn rural men into higher-paying non-farm jobs, leaving women to replace them to do the agricultural work. As a result, women’s employment in agriculture surged by 135%, and they now account for over 42% of the sector’s workforce. Two out of every three working women are now in agriculture. Yet, this rise has come with diminishing returns. Nearly half of the women in agriculture are unpaid family workers, with their numbers jumping 2.5 times from 23.6 million to 59.1 million in just eight years. As a result, today, one in three working women in India is unpaid. In States such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, more than 80% of women workers are in agriculture, and over half of them receive no wages. Much of this invisibility stems from systemic inequities. Women are not officially recognised as farmers, own only 13-14% of land holdings, and earn 20-30% less than men for equivalent work. Asset ownership, decision-making power, and access to credit and government support remain male-dominated, trapping women in low-value activities. As a result, women’s greater participation has not translated into higher income for the economy, as agriculture’s share of the national GVA fell from 15.3% in 2017-18 to 14.4% in 2024-25.

Indian Tea Association chairperson Hemant Bangur during the 142 annual general meeting of Indian Tea Association (ITA) in Kolkata had described the  floods in north Bengal floods as manifestation of climate change. “The devastating floods and landslides in North Bengal over the last week-end, particularly in the Darjeeling Hills and part of Dooars, eroding plantation areas and the tragic loss of lives are manifestations of the adversaries of climate change. The urgency to avert or find solutions for such disasters goes without saying,” Mr. Bangur said.

In a report, “Strategies and Pathways for Accelerating Growth in Pulses towards the Goal ofAtmanirbharta,” released here on Thursday (September 4, 2025), the policy think tank laid out a detailed road map for expanding pulses cultivation in the country. Commenting on the progress achieved in expanding the cultivation of pulses and reducing the dependency on import of pulses, NITI Aayog member Ramesh Chand said in this pace, the country would attain self-sufficiency in pulses within 10 years. India is the world’s largest producer, consumer and importer of pulses. “The role of pulses in ensuring food security, nutritional well-being, and sustainable agriculture with significant environmental benefits is therefore, very critical,” the NITI Aayog’s report said. The report said with nearly 80% of production dependent on rain-fed areas and sustaining the livelihoods of over five crore farmers and their families, the pulses sector was vital to rural economies. “Following a decline in production to 16.35 million tonnes (MT) in 2015–16, which necessitated 6 MT of imports, concerted interventions by the Government of India spurred remarkable progress. By 2022–23, production rose by 59.4% to 26.06 MT, accompanied by a 38% increase in productivity, reducing import dependence from 29% to 10.4%,” the report said, adding that the “Mission forAtmanirbhartain Pulses”, a six-year focused initiative targeting pigeonpea, black gram, and lentil was announced in the budget to further strengthen India’s self-reliance.

123,2025,The Hindu,123,"Climate change, imbalance in fertilizer use impacts soil’s organic carbon: ICAR study A detailed study conducted by eight scientists of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), including its Director General Mangi Lal Jat, has found that the unscientific use of fertilisers and climate change are contributing to degradation of organic carbon in arable areas of the country. The study, primarily coordinated by the ICAR’s Indian Institute of Soil Science in Bhopal, has used 254,236 soil samples of 620 districts covering 29 States to reach the conclusions. A research paper based on the six-year-long study started in 2017 has been published now in the England-based international research journal ‘Land Degradation & Development.’ Talking toThe Hinduabout the research, coordinator of the project Arvind K. Shukla said organic carbon is not only part of the chemistry of the soil, but it covers all the aspects of physics, chemistry and biology of soil. He said a study published by the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organisation about 25 years ago flagged this issue, but the samples were very low. “In this study, we have taken samples extensively, and the sample collection was well designed. We have covered both arable and barren land, mostly arable land,” he said. The study has found that if the organic carbon is low, then the deficiency of micronutrients in the soil is high, and if the organic carbon is high, the deficiency is low. The team used an earlier study that said rainfall and temperature determined organic carbon. “We correlated this across the country. We found that organic carbon is highly correlated with the elevation. If the elevation of the land is high, then the organic carbon content is high. But if we move from hills to low land, then the organic carbon content is low,” he added. Mr. Shukla said organic soil carbon is negatively correlated with temperature. “For example, in Rajasthan and Telangana, the temperature is very high and their organic carbon content is low,” he added.

124,2025,The Hindu,124,"Microbial link between arsenic in soil, lower rice yield uncoveredPremium Research published inProceedings of the National Academy of Sciencesrecently has warned that the type of microbes in rice paddies can determine whether arsenic, a notorious carcinogen and plant toxin, builds up in rice grains and triggers drastic crop losses. Thestudyhas identified an important balance between arsenic-methylating bacteria, which convert inorganic arsenic into the toxic organic forms, versus demethylating archaea, which can undo this process. Where the methylating bacteria dominate, rice plants absorb the compound dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) and its more toxic derivative, dimethylated monothioarsenate (DMMTA). These compounds pose health risks to humans as well as induce straighthead disease. “Straighthead needs to be considered as a physiological disorder rather than a disease in the absence of any infectious agent,” rice pathologist Sridhar Ranganathan, who wasn’t involved in the study, said. “The symptoms are erect panicles with unfilled grains, often remaining green. Due to empty grains affecting the weight of the panicles, the-ear bearing tillers don’t droop down and remain green and upright, as can be seen with unaffected healthy plants bearing normally filled matured grains in which the plants droop down showing symptoms of initiation of senescence of the leaves and the grains.” While long dismissed as a local agronomic issue, straighthead disease is now recognised as a global threat. In parts of the US and China, farmers have reported significant outbreaks, often in newly established or rotated paddies. West Bengal in India and Bangladesh have also previously reported straighthead disease. The condition can result in up to 70% yield losses in severely affected areas. It occurs even when the total arsenic level in the soil is relatively low because the real problem is arsenic speciation, i.e. the chemical form arsenic takes in the soil and plant.

127,2025,The Hindu,127,"Small farms are more productive than large farms, finds study  Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT Bombay) and the University of Hyderabad conducted a study and found that productivity in India’s semi-arid tropics depends less on farm size and more on access to inputs, credit, and markets. The study involved analysing data from 1975 to 2014 and examining changes through three waves over 40 years. The researchers found that small farms were indeed more productive, especially in the early years (1975–84), citing more intensive family labour, higher attention, and adding more fertilisers per unit compared to larger landholders. The 1960s have shown that smaller farms are generally more productive than large farms in terms of yield per acre. However, the new study proves that even during those early years, the productivity scale was not as tilted towards small farms as previously thought. The findings suggest that the inverse farm size-productivity relationship, where the productivity decreases as the farm size increases, was never as pronounced in the semi-arid regions of India. As agrarian distress dragged on in these regions, the productivity advantage of small farms faded in the later years (2009-2014). “The smallholders still matter greatly for food security and rural stability, but they are increasingly vulnerable due to monocropping and high input costs. To strengthen the capacity of smallholders, the need is to improve their access to appropriate technologies, affordable credit, and reliable extension services,” says Prof. Sarthak Gaurav from Shailesh J. Mehta School of Management, IIT Bombay and a co-author of the study. The findings prove that the farm size-productivity relationship is complex, context-dependent, and much weaker than previously thought.

His elegance, tempo control and technical clarity have long made him one of the country’s most reliable 50-over batters. Yeton Sunday (November 30, 2025) in Ranchi, as he returned to India’s blue jersey after 16 months, Gaikwad experienced something he had never been asked to do before. In his 87th List A innings, Gaikwad batted at No. 4 for the first time. Until then, he had batted at No. 3 on just five occasions; every other knock was as an opener. His rise as a List A force has been built almost entirely on opening the innings. But with Shreyas Iyer still recovering from a lacerated spleen sustained in the final ODI in Australia last month, the No. 4 slot was vacant. When the squad was announced, the selection committee had labelled Tilak Varma, Rishabh Pant and Dhruv Jurel as primarily contenders for the spot. Nowhere did it indicate that Gaikwad — picked as a reserve opener — was in that conversation. What complicated matters further was that if captain Shubman Gill recovered from his neck spasm in time, Gaikwad would not even have been in Ranchi. He would have continued leading Maharashtra in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. Yet there he was — walking in at No. 4 in the den of his IPL mentor Mahendra Singh Dhoni, wearing a role he has never owned in domestic white-ball cricket.

The initiative focuses on technologies and practices that help produce food crops in a climate resilient manner. The Dutch horticultural sector has formed a consortium, HortiRoad2India, a public-private partnership, to take forward its initiative in India. The consortium is now ready to forge alliance with stakeholders in India. Tiffany Meijer, Project Manager for International Trade in the Dutch horticulture sector & co-lead for HortiRoad2India, says the Dutch team has spent the last five years on understanding the Indian requirements based on which a comprehensive package has been prepared. Emphasising that it comes with a pragmatic and holistic approach, Desh Ramnath, Director and co-ordinator of HortiRoad2India, says it would involve technology consultation, education, training and market linkages. “We have even built finance models with Indian banks together with the Dutch government,” he says. According to him, the Dutch package would offer mid-tech and high-tech green house technologies that include building glass houses instead of conventional polyhouses for high-efficiency and climate resilience. However, the choice of mid-tech or high-tech polyhouses would depend on the nature of crops proposed to be grown. While strawberry, coloured capsicum, cherry tomato, micro greens and lettuce are proposed to be grown in hi-tech glass houses, tomato cultivation can be ideally taken place in mid-tech green houses, he explained. “The technology is environmentally and financially sustainable as we use 96% less water when compared with cultivation on open field, and get 30 times more yield (with respect to tomato).

134,2025,The Hindu,134,"Clustering maize plants together can improve their insect resistancePremium Maize (Zea mays) has long stood at the intersection ofhuman culture and the natural world. Originating from teosinte, a wild grass domesticated in Mesoamerica over 9,000 years ago, it was gradually transformed through centuries of selective breeding by Indigenous farmers. From a small-eared plant with a handful of hard kernels, maize thus evolved into the high-yielding, single-stalked crop recognised worldwide today. Today, maize is the world’s most widely grown grain. Beyond food, it underpins global economies as animal feed, biofuel, and a raw material for countless industrial products. However, its dependence on large-scale, high-density monocultures leaves it vulnerable to pests and diseases. These challenges have been intensified by climate change, especially rising temperature and unpredictable weather. Expertshave projectedthe average global maize productivity could fall by up to 24% by the late 21st century under SSP585, a high-emissions scenario consistent with continued fossil-fuel use. In search of sustainable solutions, researchers from Zhejiang University in China in collaboration with partners from the Netherlands and Switzerland have uncovered an unexpected and powerful form of plant communication that could strengthen crop resilience. Their study, published inSciencein August, focused on linalool, a naturally occurring compound known for a floral, woody scent that’s used in perfumes and soaps. The team’s findings were based on examining a plant-soil feedback mechanism — a process in which a plant alters the soil environment, which in turn affects the growth and health of the plants. Plants use the volatile compound linalool as a kind of warning signal. When maize plants are attacked by insects, those in crowded fields release more of it, alerting their neighbours and triggering defensive responses. The researchers noticed this effect when comparing maize planted at different densities.

Speaking at the 'Nagaland United: A Gathering of Faith, Hope and Revival' held at Indira Gandhi Stadium in Kohima on Sunday (November 30, 2025), Mr. Rio said that foreign dignitaries, including evangelist Franklin Graham, continue to face difficulties as PAP clearances are not issued on time. Mr. Graham was supposed to be the main speaker at the programme and also attend the inaugural session of the 10-day Hornbill Festival, which will start on Monday. But he could not attend the programme after his travel documentation and clearance were delayed. PAP is a travel document required by foreigners to visit certain sensitive areas in the country. Mr. Rio had on November 18 and 28 written to the Union Home Minister Amit Shah, requesting early clearance of visas for foreign tourists, and urging that the PAP regime for Nagaland be lifted permanently, which was reimposed from December last year. The CM said that although the Centre has relaxed the PAP requirement for Nagaland from December 1 to 10 to facilitate the Hornbill Festival, the temporary measure ""does not solve the larger issue"". He said the state Cabinet reviewed the matter in January, and several representations were sent to the Centre since the re-imposition of PAP on December 17 for Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland.

The seven-road project spanning 26.72 km requires coordination between the GVMC, Roads & Buildings, Panchayat Raj, Forests, and private landowners who have parted their stretches for the projects. According to sources, the road projects have slowed down due to land acquisition challenges, with the toughest hurdle being the acquisition of 75 acres. Compensation options include cash payments, alternative sites, and transferable development rights (TDRs). So far, only a few landowners have agreed to the compensation through TDRs. The seven roads are being constructed at an estimated cost of Rs. 156 crore, including CSR funds from the corporate companies. These roads include: An 8 km road from Adivivaram BRTS junction to Gandigundam (Rs. 40 crore), awaiting forest clearance; a 2.2 km road from Anandapuram NH to Gambhiram Reservoir, a 1.7 km expansion from Shivashakti Nagar to the VUDA Haritha project (Rs. 7.65 crore); a 1.4 km expansion from Paradeshipalem to Gambhiram (Rs. 5.04 crore); a 3.83 km road from Nerallavalasa to Tallavalasa (Rs. 24 crore); a 3 km widening from Boyapalem Junction to Kapuluppada (Rs. 15 crore); widening of 6.32-km road from Chippada to Polipilli (Rs. 37.92 crore).

While the structure boasts three 12-millimetre-thick laminated glass panels, an eerie feeling slowly crept within me as I listened to the gushing winds combined with the babbling reservoir. It is quite a climb to  the glass bridge, scaling a spiral stairwell and passing through almost all the attractions inside the Village — from play areas to 12 D theatres. The bridge, visible from the entrance, welcomes visitors from afar, with an LED-illuminated outline, which reminded me of the Led Zeppelin song title ‘Stairway to Heaven’. Further mystifying its appearance is a fog machine that occasionally goes off on both sides of the bridge creating the vibe of a hill station, making you forget that you are only 10 kilometres from Thiruvananthapuram city, where the excruciating torture of heavy traffic begins minutes after the sun sets. Here, the only signal you wait for is from the caretaker who politely asks you to take off your footwear before climbing  the bridge. Stepping onto the bridge is a daunting experience, as you try your level best not to look down. I am still confused about whether it was me or the bridge that was shaking.

The Union Agriculture Ministry said the draft is aligned with current agricultural and regulatory requirements. The proposed legislation is intended to replace the existing Seeds Act, 1966 and the Seeds (Control) Order, 1983. While the seed industry welcomed the move, farmer organisations reminded the Centre that it had to withdraw the Bill on two occasions following their resistance. The Centre said in a release that the draft Seeds Bill, 2025 seeks to regulate the quality of seeds and planting materials available in the market; ensure farmers’ access to high-quality seeds at affordable rates; curb the sale of spurious and poor-quality seeds; protect farmers from losses; liberalise seed imports to promote innovation and access to global varieties; and safeguard the rights of farmers, ensuring transparency and accountability in seed supply chains. “On the enforcement side, the draft Bill proposes to decriminalise minor offences, thereby promoting ‘Ease of Doing Business’ and reducing compliance burden, while maintaining strong provisions to penalise serious violations effectively,” the government said. All stakeholders and members of the public can submit their comments and suggestions on the draft Bill and its provisions by December 11, 2025. As per the draft, every dealer and distributor in seeds “shall obtain a registration certificate from the State government before selling, keeping for sale, offering to sell, importing or exporting, or otherwise supplying any seed by himself or by another person on his behalf”.

Harpreet Singh Gulati, who is in the liquor trade, was arrested on Saturday, they said. During the probe, the Bureau detected a transaction of ₹10 crore between Gulati's companies and firms run by the Majithia family, public prosecutor Preet Inderpal Singh said. Mr. Gulati was earlier questioned about the transaction, but he failed to give any satisfactory reply, Mr. Singh said. Mr. Gulati was produced before a court in Mohali, which sent him to a six-day vigilance remand, special public prosecutor Ferry Sofat said. An official spokesperson of the Vigilance Bureau said Mr. Majithia, who is presently lodged in the New Nabha jail in Patiala after his arrest in a disproportionate assets case, faces serious allegations of quid pro quo. After the Akalis came to power in Punjab in 2007, the liquor sector allegedly “faced capture by political interests”, he said in a statement. Mr. Gulati's firms allegedly secured liquor licences at Mr. Majithia's instance from 2008 onward, the spokesperson claimed. “Mr. Gulati's firms allegedly paid ₹4.25 crore (2008-09) and ₹1.40 crore (2009-10) to Mr. Majithia's companies and family, funding a farmhouse at the Sainik Farms in Delhi and other family benefits,” the spokesperson said.

Vithal Memorial Lecture at the Centre for Economics and Social Studies, Hyderabad on Monday (December 1, 2025). Mr. Ahluwalia argued that India’s reform challenges are now qualitatively different from the early liberalisation phase, which mainly required persuading bureaucrats, while today’s problems cut across federal politics, climate pressures, technology disruptions and global geopolitical fragmentation. He added that India’s domestic target of becoming a developed nation by 2047, as outlined in the Viksit Bharat vision, requires consistent real growth of about 8% and cautioned that such a shift cannot be assumed simply because recent quarterly numbers have occasionally touched higher levels. He stressed that the underlying growth rate remains around 6.5%, and while good policies can push it upwards, bad policies can lower it quickly in a volatile world. Mr. Ahluwalia outlined three major global shifts that India must adjust to. The first is the sharp deterioration in the global geopolitical environment. The second shift is the transformation in global trade patterns as economies rethink supply chains, and the third shift is the acceleration of technological change. “Unlike earlier waves of innovation that allowed labour markets time to adjust, current disruptions may eliminate large segments of modern-sector jobs very quickly, while creation of new jobs may lag,” he added.

The consumer non-durables sector contracted 4.4% compared with a growth of 2.8% over the same period. “Consumer goods registered negative growth, and the inventory factor would have played out,” Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at the Bank of Baroda said. “It was -0.5% for durables and -4.4% for non-durables. This would need to be monitored for the next two months where traction in a positive direction should be seen.” The mining and quarrying sector contracted 1.8% in October 2025, with the sector contracting in six out of the last seven months. The manufacturing sector grew at a nearly two-year low of 1.8%, down from 4.4% in October last year. The infrastructure and construction goods sector grew by 7.1% in October 2025, up from 4.7% in October last year. However, this was lower than the double-digit growth the sector has been seeing in the July-September 2025 quarter.",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/industrial-output-growth-at-13-month-low-of-04-in-october/article70345123.ece
148,2025,The Hindu,148,"​Speedbreakers ahead: On India’s economic data The last few days have shown just what a roller coaster of a ride India’s economic data can take. Last Friday’s robust Q2 GDP growth, asix-quarter high of 8.2%, lifted the government’s mood and brought cheer to its supporters. The relatively low nominal growth rate and grade by the IMF did little to dampen this feeling. However, the latest data on the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) and, to an extent, the manufacturing PMI are likely to do more in that regard. TheIIP’s growth in October 2025 was just 0.4%, a 14-month low. While the GDP data for the July-September quarter showed the manufacturing sector growing 9.1%, the IIP showed the sector had slowed to a 14-month low of 1.8% in October. One of the possible reasons for this is that the GDP growth rate was boosted by a low base, since the sector had grown just 2.2% in the July-September 2024 quarter. The other, more troubling reason, is the impact of the U.S.’s tariffs. Merchandise exports grew in September, the first full month of 50% tariffs, as earlier orders were being fulfilled. They then contracted nearly 12% in October as the tariffs began to weigh on new order decisions. The PMI data, too, showed that the score for India’s manufacturing sector stood at a nine-month low of 56.6 in November. The report specifically mentioned that new export orders rose at their slowest pace in over a year, another sign that the U.S.’s tariffs were hurting. While subdued exports likely weighed on the manufacturing sector, the change in weather towards winter and prolonged rains pulled down the electricity and mining sectors, respectively. As a result, the primary goods sector contracted in October. The GDP data had shown that investment had grown by a reasonably strong 7.3% in Q2. However, the IIP data suggest this could have slowed in the beginning of Q3 with the capital goods sector growing at a 14-month low of 2.4%. The IIP data also have some concerning news regarding household consumption.

Traders offered the new exchange rate as attempts so far to restart negotiations between America and Iran over its nuclear program appear stalled. The new record low is increasing pressure on food prices and other costs have been making daily life that much more challenging for Iranians. Prices are up on meat, rice and other staples of the Iranian dinner table. Meanwhile, people worry about anew round of fighting between Iran and Israel— as well as potentially the United States — after June’s 12-day war. “Life will not only become more difficult for ordinary people, but it will also fuel public concern over whether the government — given the limited inflow of foreign currency caused by sanctions — has the resources to maintain and repair the country’s aging infrastructure,” said Ali Moshtagh, a 53-year-old electrical engineer. Iran’s economy has been severely affected by international sanctions, particularly after U.S. President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers in 2018. At the time of the 2015 deal, which saw Iran drastically limit its enrichment and stockpiling of uranium in exchange for lifting of international sanctions, the rial traded at 32,000 to the dollar. After Mr. Trump returned to the White House for his second term in January, he restarted his so-called “maximum pressure” campaign targeting Tehran with sanctions. He again went after firms trading Iranian crude oil, including those selling at a discount in China.

This is the fourth consecutive session in which the rupee has depreciated against the dollar. A delayed U.S.-India trade deal, non-intervention from the RBI and a widening trade deficit are the reasons behind the depreciation, according to Dilip Parmar, Senior Research Analyst at HDFC Securities. The rupee has been on a declining trend since May 2025, and it hit a fresh low at the end of August at a little more than ₹88 per dollar. After this, analysts forecast that if the central bank did not step in at ₹89 a dollar, it would go as high as ₹90 a dollar. In November 2025, the rupee was down 0.8% while the dollar was also depreciating, marking a “puzzling” trend, Aditi Gupta, Economist at BoB research, wrote. “Annualised daily volatility was just 1.4% in the first half but increased to 4.9% in the second half,” Ms. Gupta said. While the widening trade deficit is cited as a factor, she said that the depreciation this time was more a result of the sentiments of traders in the backdrop of uncertainty surrounding the U.S.-India trade deal. “Receding FPI interest in Indian equities has also added to the depreciating currency,” she added.

Forex traders said a strong greenback and a rise in international crude oil prices also weighed down the Indian currency. Moreover, significant dollar demand by importers exerted persistent downward pressure on the local currency. At the interbank foreign exchange market, the rupee opened at 89.45, then lost its ground and fell to a record low of 89.79 (provisional) against the U.S. dollar in intraday trade, registering a fall of 34 paise over its previous close.

On November 21, the rupee plunged 98 paise to close at its lifetime low of 89.66 against the U.S. dollar. “The rupee has been under pressure as there has been heavy buying by FPIs taking out money, outflows happening as stakes were sold in various companies due to high valuations, oil buying, gold buying and repayments by corporates and central government,” Anil Kumar Bhansali, head of treasury and executive director at Finrex Treasury Advisors LLP, said. Mr. Bhansali further noted that trade tensions with the U.S. continue, with expectations of a settlement towards the end of the year.

TheGross Domestic Product (GDP)registered a six-quarter high growth of 8.2% in Q2 of 2025-26,underpinned by resilient domestic demand amidst global tradeand policy uncertainties. On the supply side, real Gross Value Added (GVA) expanded by 8.1%, aided by buoyant industrial and services sectors. Unveiling the December monetary policy, Reserve Bank Governor Sanjay Malhotra said economic activity during the first half of 2025-26 benefited from income tax and Goods and Services Tax (GST) rationalisation, softer crude oil prices, front-loading of government capital expenditure, and facilitative monetary and financial conditions supported by benign inflation. High-frequency indicators suggest that domestic economic activity is holding up in the October-December quarter, although there are some emerging signs of weakness in few leading indicators, he said. ""GST rationalisation and festival-related spending supported domestic demand during October-November,"" he said and added rural demand continues to be robust while urban demand is recovering steadily. Also, investment activity remains healthy with private investment gaining steam on the back of expansion in non-food bank credit, and high capacity utilisation. The governor also noted that merchandise exports declined sharply in October amid subdued external demand, accompanied by softer services exports. On the supply side, agricultural growth is supported by healthy kharif crop production, higher reservoir levels and better rabi crop sowing. Manufacturing activity continues to improve, while the services sector is maintaining a steady pace, Malhotra said.

Her view was that female body is connected to the moon; changes in our body are related to changes in that celestial body.” Bhadra Rajin

The four labour codes — Code on Wages, 2019, Industrial Relations Code, 2020, Code on Social Security, 2020 and the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020 - were notified on November 21. For enforcing a law, the government needs to notify rules under that to operationalise the legislation.

162,2025,The Hindu,162,"Cautious optimism: On India and growth India’s September-quarter GDP data for the current financial year beat all estimates, coming in at 8.2%, higher than 7.8% in Q1 FY26 and well above the year-ago period. This offers fleeting reassurance to policymakers, days after October’s trade data revealed a historic deficit of $41.68 billion, driven partly by a trebling of bullion imports — a signal of economic uncertainty. Growth has been led by manufacturing (9.1%) and services (9.2%), supported by a recovery in private consumption. Private Final Consumption Expenditure grew 7.9% in Q2 FY26, compared with 6.4% in Q2 FY25, while government spending also provided a modest boost. Together, these suggest a broad-based uptick in domestic activity despite global headwinds. Yet, the full effects of the external shock may surface in the quarters ahead. The U.S.’s ‘two-stage’ India tariffs, in August, landed mid-quarter. Some front-loading of export orders ahead of these tariffs may also have inflated Q2 output. A second statistical effect is at play. Retail inflation fell to 0.25% in October, the lowest in the current CPI series, contributing to a GDP deflator reportedly below 1%. A deflator this low mechanically inflates real GDP relative to nominal; the narrow gap between nominal GDP (8.7%) and real GDP (8.2%) underscores this. Should inflation rise or input costs firm up — if oil prices climb as India diversifies away from Russian crude — headline GDP growth may moderate.

163,2025,The Hindu,163,"Excise duty to ensure tax incidence on tobacco remains same after GST cess ends: Sitharaman Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday (December 3, 2025) said the levy of excise on tobacco will ensure that incidence of tax on the demerit good remains same even after the expiry of the GST compensation cess. Movingthe Central Excise (Amendment) Bill, 2025, for discussion and passage in the Lok Sabha, the Finance Minister said since the GST law caps maximum rate of tax at 40%, the ultimate tax incidence on tobacco after removal of GST cess would come down from the current level if excise duty is not levied. “In order to ensure that the incidence is not lower than what it was during GST with the compensation cess, we are bringing this excise. In a way we are saying cigarettes should not become affordable now because incidence has become lesser,” the Minister said. The bill proposes to replace the GST compensation cess which is currently levied on all tobacco products like cigarette, chewing tobacco, cigar, hookah, zarda, and scented tobacco. Currently, a 28% GST plus cess at varied rate is levied on tobacco. The bill proposes to levy excise duty of 60-70% on unmanufactured tobacco. The excise duty on cigars and cheroots is proposed at 25% or ₹5,000 per 1,000 sticks, whichever is higher. Cigarettes, not having filters, and of length not over 65 millimetres will attract duty of ₹2,700 per 1,000 sticks and ₹4,500 per 1,000 sticks for length over 65 millimetres but not exceeding 70 millimetres. The Finance Minister further said the bill was necessary as the loan taken to meet the revenue loss of states during Covid will be repaid in a “couple of weeks”, post which the compensation cess will cease to exist. “In another, probably, couple of weeks the loans will be completely repaid.  The Centre, therefore, wants to make sure that the excise will come back to us so that we can levy the duty,” Ms. Sitharaman said. At the time of the introduction of the GST on July 1, 2017, a compensation cess mechanism was put in place for 5 years till June 30, 2022, to make up ",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/excise-duty-to-ensure-tax-incidence-on-tobacco-remains-same-after-gst-cess-ends-sitharaman/article70353224.ece

The protest led to tense moments in the area and disruption of traffic. The agitation, organised in front of the Block Development Office, was led by Karaikal District Congress Committee president Chandramohan. Former minister M. Kamalakannan, several party functionaries and a large number of workers employed under the rural 100-day employment scheme took part. Protesters said they had been working continuously for three months in Karaikal region but had not received their wages. They demanded immediate disbursal of pending payments, pointing out that the workers’ families were struggling without income, especially during the monsoon when other sources of livelihood were scarce. Police personnel from the Town police station held talks with the agitators and asked them to disperse. However, the protesters insisted that the demonstration would continue until they received a firm assurance from the administration and shifted to a road blockade on the main thoroughfare, causing traffic congestion in the vicinity. On receiving information, Block Development Officer Arunagirinathan arrived at the spot and held discussions with the Congress leaders and workers. He assured them that the pending wages would be released within two weeks, following which the agitators withdrew the protest. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Kamalakannan said that the non-payment of wages was not confined to Karaikal alone. “For three months, workers under the 100-day scheme in Puducherry and Karaikal have not been paid. It is painful that the Puducherry administration has not shown adequate concern. This is the monsoon season; workers are already facing joblessness and income loss. The government must intervene immediately and ensure that all pending wages are cleared.”",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/congress-stages-protest-in-karaikal-over-non-payment-of-100-day-work-wages/article70353319.ece

During her Budget presentation in July last year Ms. Sitharaman announced the government’s decision to overhaul the more than six decades old law. “This will reduce disputes and litigation, thereby providing tax certainty to the taxpayers. It will also bring down the demand embroiled in litigation,” she reasoned, for the new law. The bill has beenreferred to a 31-member Select Committee of the Lok Sabha, to be chaired by the Bharatiya Janata Party MP Baijayant Panda. The committee is expected to table its report on the first day of the next Parliament session. ALSO WATCHWatch | Explained: What’s in the new Income Tax Bill? The existing Income Tax Act of 1961 has been amended numerous times, “overburdening” the law and making its language complex, argues the new IT Bill. This, it says, has increased compliance costs for taxpayers and impeded direct tax administration. The latest bill aspires to address such inefficiencies. Three broad measures have been adopted to pursue this objective. The first entails simplifying the language of the Act to make it more readable. It also attempts to remove redundant and repetitive provisions and re-organises sections for better navigation with logical links. The proposed IT Act also uses tables and formulae where needed. For instance, the existing Act has 43 sections for various incomes liable for tax deducted at source (TDS) depending on the status of the payer or payee and applicable monetary limits have been mentioned. The proposed bill consolidates them all into one section. To make this more understandable, the bill mentions tables for three broad categories of payees–residents, non-residents and all others. It does not distinguish between Indian and foreign nationals.

The slew of projects kept key NDA ally, the Janata Dal (United), in good humour, while generating envy from other regional parties, as well as taunts from the Opposition’s Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), which termed the announcements empty rhetoric in the absence of a special package for the State. Bihar is set to go to the polls later this year. The Mithilanchal region of the State got special attention in the Budget. Key announcements include ₹11,500 crore of financial support for the Western Koshi Canal Extension, Renovation, and Modernisation (ERM) Project, and a new Makhana Board for foxnut farmers. The canal project, Ms. Sitharaman said, will benefit “farmers cultivating over 50,000 hectares of land in Bihar”. TheMakhana Board will “improve production, processing, value addition, and marketing”of foxnuts, the Finance Minister said. Mithila Makhana got a Geographical Indication (GI) tag in 2022, and 80% of India’s total makhana production is harvested in Bihar. The move is likely to benefit over five lakh farmers in the region, especially in the districts of Darbhanga, Madhubani, Sitamarhi, Saharsa, Katihar, Purnia, Kishanganj, Araria, Supaul, and Madhepura.

Also, maintaining passion assets such as art and wine requires special care involving a huge cost. Here, we discuss how you should, if you want to, move investments to passion assets. Previously, we discussed portfolio portability. Specifically, we mentioned if you are a working executive with a skill set that can fetch a job across the world, investing in financial assets is optimal compared with physical assets such as gold and realty. To this, you can add passion assets, which are collectibles with investment value. Examples include art, antiques, wine and vintage cars. That said, investing in passion assets can be meaningful if you can efficiently shift possession each time you relocate, or if you are settled in current place of residence. When you move money from financial to physical assets, you are moving from more portable to less portable investments viz. reverse portability. You can enjoy the beauty of passion assets while you own them and earn returns when you sell them. But to be meaningful, how should you shift equity investments to passion assets? One, you must not move money from core portfolio earmarked for goals that have a time horizon of 10 years or less. On a conservative note, it is preferable to move money from your retirement portfolio and not from portfolios earmarked for intermediate goals. Two, consider moving realised gains and not the capital. At the extreme, you should not move more than 20% of your equity investments to passion assets. Finally, it is best to move the money from satellite rather than from the core portfolio. Passion assets are illiquid and need long holding period to earn sizeable returns. It is best to “invest” in collectibles that are rare and unique. Importantly, price leverage works just as well in passion assets as it does for real estate. That is, an investment of ₹50,000 can double to ₹1 lakh but an investment of ₹10 lakh cannot just as ",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/equity-to-passion-assets/article69618738.ece

In FY 2025-26 Budget, ₹86,000 crore has been allocated for the scheme, which is same as the budget allocation for 2024-25. While the Centre insists that the MGNREGS is a demand driven scheme and additional funds are given when required, no upward revision was made in the ongoing financial year. Therefore, Budget Estimate 2024-25, Revised Estimate 2024-25 and the Budget Estimate 2025-26 are the same at ₹86,000 crore. A significant amount of the budget each year is spent in covering the dues of the previous financial year. The pending dues of West Bengal is around ₹7,500 crore. If the issue is resolved this year, the allocated budget will further decrease. The legislation dictates that the workers have to be paid their wages within 15-days of doing the work. But due to the allocation, the Centre will not be able to meet this deadline. “The ongoing financial year has another three-months to go. The programme is already running on a deficit. This means that for the next three months wages will be further delayed. Significantly, with such low allocation, the scheme will be rationed in the next FY leading to artificial suppression of demand,” Nikhil Dey, Founder Member of Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan. The low allocation is directly related to suppression of demand. The Economic Survey had said that the employment was often unavailable when sought. The Act mandates that the worker should be provided unemployment allowance if work is not provided within 15-days of raising the demand.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman sought to do just that on Saturday (February 1, 2025) with herUnion Budget for 2025-26— jumpstart slowing economic activity with a significant ₹1 lakh crore tax stimulus for households of the sort the government has generally refrained from — in the hope that India’s weakening domestic demand will rebound and bring the economy back to the fast lane. Union Budget 2025 | Highlights Ms. Sitharaman began her speech by stating the Budget seeks to accelerate growth, uplift household sentiments and enhance the spending power of India’s rising middle class, and ended with the biggest relief measure for taxpayers in recent times —no income tax would be payable for annual incomes of up to ₹12 lakh, up from the present limit of ₹7 lakh. Finance Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey said the change under the new personal income tax regime, where no other exemptions are permitted, could help one crore tax payers have a zero-tax liability, except on incomes from sources like capital gains that attract special rates. For salaried tax payers, the tax-free income threshold will be ₹12.75 lakh a year, thanks to standard deduction of ₹75,000. Below tables show calculations on the total tax payable across various salary brackets/slabs as per the old tax regime, new tax regime, and the newly proposed tax slabs under the revised tax regime in the in the Union Budget 2025-26.

The Mission, with sectoral and ministerial targets, will be driven jointly by the Ministries of Commerce, MSMEs, and Finance. This is among the slew of measures announced in the Budget to promote exports. Another major plan is to create a digital public infrastructure, ‘BharatTradeNet’ (BTN), for international trade and it will be an unified platform for trade documentation and financing solutions. This will complement the Unified Logistics Interface Platform. The government will also revamp the model BIT (Bilateral Investment Treaty) to make it more investor-friendly and encourage sustained foreign investment. In order to support food processing exports, a National Food Technology Institute will be set up in Bihar and it will enhance value addition, agri-exports, and job creation. The duration for export of handicrafts manufactured from duty free inputs by bona fide exporters will be extended to one year, further extendable by 3 months. A release from the Department of Commerce says India’s trade deficit in maritime services is about $50 billion and development of Indian shipping lines is likely to address this trade deficit. Shipbuilding financial assistance policy will be revamped, including credit notes for ship-breaking to support a circular economy. The Maritime Development Fund of ₹25,000 crore will be used to finance long-term industry growth, with 49% government contribution.

One of the four pillars of aViksit Bharat 2047is mahila or woman. The Finance Minister mentioned women several times in her 74-minute speech during the Union Budget. One of the most powerful tools to show commitment to the cause ofwomen’s empowermentis through fiscal backing. This year, the gender budget has increased to 8.9% of the overall Budget. Chart 1 shows the gender budget over the years as a share of the overall Budget (in percentage). Chart appears incomplete? Click to remove AMP mode It is important to note here that there is no separate gender budget in the overall Budget; this term simply refers to all the allocations to gender-related schemes under various ministries and departments. Chart 2 shows the distribution of the gender budget over the years Where does the money go? Gender budgets have three components: Part A comprises schemes with 100% provision for women and girls; Part B comprises schemes with 30-99% allocations for women and girls; and Part C reflects schemes with allocations for women and girls below 30% of the provision. Part C was introduced only in the 2024-25 Budget. Over time, as seen in Chart 2, the proportion of Part A has decreased and the proportion of Part B has increased. Since the inception of the concept of a gender budget, the highest number of ministries/departments (49) have reported allocations for gender-related schemes this year. Twelve new ministries/departments have reported allocations for gender-related schemes this year. This indicates that there is a push to diversify the gender budget from the Ministry of Women and Child Development. Around 10 ministries/departments have reported more than 30% of their allocations to gender-related schemes for FY 2025-26.

It aims to makemore affordable some lifesaving drugs needed for treating cancer, other chronic diseases, and some rare diseases. It also seeks to expand the coverage of health insurance, while providing incentives for private sector-led medical tourism. While health research gets a needed boost and digital health gets energised, primary healthcare does not get the needed support. Health research and child nutrition programmes get greater support but adolescent health and adult nutrition do not benefit from budgetary initiatives. In her budgetary speech, the Finance Minister announced support for creating 75,000 more undergraduate seats in medical colleges over the next five years, starting with 10,000 more seats in the coming year. This will help in meeting health workforce shortages that are limiting access to needed health services, even as the demand for health services will rise due to a growing and ageing population. The Budget does not refer to other sections of the health workforce. Nurses and allied health professionals also need investments for scaling up and skilling up. Compared to the previous year’s Budget, the proposed allocation for health has increased by 9.70%. This includes a 9.47% increase for the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, a 7.55% increase for the AYUSH Ministry, and an 18.14% increase for health research (Indian Council of Medical Research, and the Department of Health Research). The Ayushman Bharat Infrastructure Mission (ABHIM) gets a 26.68% rise.

183,2025,The Hindu,183,"Avoid costly mistakes in retirement plansPremium Retirement planning is a crucial aspect of personal finance. Rising life expectancy, growing prevalence of nuclear families and lack of social security for the elderly have further increased its importance. Here are some suggestions to avoid common retirement planning errors. Many investors wrongly assume a steep reduction in living expenses post retirement. While some expenses like commuting may reduce, rising chances of catching diseases, risks of injuries and other age-related health risks are likely to lead to a steady increase in healthcare expenses. Another critical factor is longevity risk — the possibility of outliving your corpus. As medical advancements are likely to raise life expectancy, one should factor in a life expectancy of, at least 80 years while calculating retirement corpus. People also tend to ignore impact of inflation on post-retirement costs. This can leave one with inadequate retirement corpus. For example, assuming average inflation of 6%, a 35-year-old spending ₹50,000 per month will need ₹2.15 lakh a month at age of 60 for the same lifestyle. One can use online retirement calculators to calculate the monthly contributions for creating the corpus. Prefer calculators that consider key factors like current monthly expenses and expected inflation rates, among other things. The most effective way to create a sufficient corpus without straining one’s finances is to start early. For example, assuming a 12% annualised return, a 30-year-old investing ₹10,000 a month in equity mutual funds (MFs) via SIPs would have a post-retirement corpus of ₹3.5 crore in the next 30 years. Whereas a 45-year-old would require a monthly SIP investment of about ₹70,000 in equity funds for building same corpus in 15 years at the same rate of return. Volatility leads many investors to avoid equity exposure in retirement corpus. However, equity as an asset class usually outperforms inflation rate and fixed-income instruments by a wide margin in the long term.

184,2025,The Hindu,184,"Rupee cost averaging for NRIsPremium India’s investment landscape appeals to domestic and NRI investors alike, but it doesn’t come without its own set of challenges. Investors need to brace for market swings, currency fluctuations and global economic shifts. Investor sentiment has taken a hit during the recent phase of correction in the Indian market. As a result, many of them try to time the market. But it is hardly easy to time a market that moves in unpredictable cycles and makes short-term bets a risky proposition. Many investors try to chase peaks and avoid dips, only to end up making costly mistakes. A smarter strategy is Rupee Cost Averaging (RCA), allowing investors to capitalise on market volatility without getting caught up in short-term noise. Instead of worrying about the right time to invest, RCA ensures NRIs stay invested, absorb market shocks and accumulate wealth steadily over time. RCA is a disciplined investment strategy where a fixed sum is invested periodically regardless of market conditions. This means that when market prices are low, more units are purchased, and when prices rise, fewer units are bought. Over time, this strategy evens out the average investment a unit and shields investors from short-term fluctuations. Consider an NRI investing ₹25,000 a month in an equity mutual fund via a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP). If the Net Asset Value (NAV) is ₹100, you purchase 250 units. If the NAV drops to ₹80, you buy 312 units. If the NAV rises to ₹120, you purchase 208 units. Instead of trying to outguessing the market or thinking about when to invest, this approach allows NRIs accumulate wealth steadily while reducing risk. Market movements are unpredictable and for NRIs who are not closely tracking Indian markets daily, staying updated on every fluctuation is impractical. RCA ensures investments continue uninterrupted, eliminating the need to make impulsive decisions during downturns. By sticking to a pre-set investment plan, they can benefit from market corrections.

185,2025,The Hindu,185,"Smart credit card usage: 6 costly mistakes to avoidPremium Credit cards help you make high-ticket purchases and, when used responsibly, contribute to building a strong credit profile. However, there are some mistakes which can adversely impact your financial life if not avoided. A portion of your credit limit is available as a Cash Limit, which can be used to withdraw cash from an ATM using your credit card. However, most credit cards impose finance charges on the withdrawn amount from the first day, along with a one-time cash advance fee applicable to every ATM cash withdrawal. Additionally, purchases made after a cash withdrawal typically do not qualify for an interest-free period until the entire outstanding balance is repaid. This can lead to significant charges that may become difficult to pay off, increasing the risk of falling into a debt trap. Therefore, it is strongly advised to avoid withdrawing cash using a credit card unless it is a last resort in case of an emergency. Even if you have to opt for this, you should make sure to repay the amount as soon as possible to minimise additional charges. Credit cards provide users with a higher purchasing power. Access to more funds, combined with the convenience of an interest-free period, can sometimes lead to impulse purchases. Consistently spending beyond your means can accumulate a high credit card balance, which can potentially spiral into unmanageable debt. This raises the risk of late payments and additional costs in the form of late payment penalties and finance charges on outstanding as well as new transactions. To avoid this, the best approach is to make a monthly budget and stick to it by only spending as much as you can afford to repay at the end of the statement cycle. If you cannot clear the total dues on a card by the due date, you can have the option to pay a minimum amount due. While this helps avoid late payment fees and negative impact on your credit score, it comes with a cost.

186,2025,The Hindu,186,"‘Disclose PEDs to insurers’Premium For now, hiding a pre-existing disease (PED) from an insurer before buying a health policy might seem to be an advantage with a lower cost premium. However, the reality is that it can lead to rejection of the claim or even policy cancellation. In both cases, the policyholder must pay exorbitant medical bills from his/her pocket. When one buys cover, he/she is entering into a contract with the insurer. All the medical insurance policies are developed on a legally- binding principle – ‘utmost good faith’ so the insurer and the policyholder must be transparent and honest. While buying the policy, the policyholder has an obligation to disclose all relevant details regarding his/her health conditions, including PEDs. If even a small piece of information on PEDs is not disclosed, it means the policyholder has violated the fundamental legal principle, thereby forcing the insurer to reject claim or even cancel the policy itself. The premium the policyholder has paid till then will go down the drain. A PED is a disease/medical condition existing in an individual even before buying a policy. Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) guidelines say illness/disease is treated as a PED if it was diagnosed within three years (36 months) prior to the purchase of the policy by a recognised doctor. (Previously it was 48 months but IRDAI brought it down to 36 months, effective from April 1, 2024.) In common insurance parlance, if an individual knows he has a health issue before buying the policy, it is considered a PED and must be disclosed. V. Mangala, senior subject-matter executive, Aionion Insurance Marketing Pvt. Ltd., says, “It must be noted not every visit to a doctor is treated as a PED. For instance, if you consult a doctor for normal fever, cold, cough, etc. you need not reveal these details. PEDs are those ailments that have a major impact on your general health in the long run.

Acting on the Chief Minister’s directions, flood-monitoring committees had been formed at the district and taluk levels. Joint teams of Agriculture and Revenue Department officials are inspecting affected fields, and compensation would be recommended wherever crop damage exceeded 33% as per government norms. Issuing a crop management advisory, the Collector urged farmers to drain excess water from fields without delay by cutting or clearing drainage channels around the crop. During the wet spell, they should avoid applying fertilizers, spraying pesticides or using weedicides, and instead closely monitor pest and disease incidence, resorting to plant protection only when it crossed the economic threshold. Where yellowing and nutrient deficiency were seen, farmers had been advised to spray a solution prepared by mixing 2 kg of urea and 1 kg of zinc sulphate in 200 litres of water, and to provide about 25% additional nitrogen and potash as top dressing to flood-affected crops on the advice of field officers. Field bunds should be kept clean, green manure crops encouraged and chemical fertilizers used strictly at recommended doses. With the northeast monsoon expected to last till the end of December, Mr. Akash asked farmers to promptly inform local Agriculture officials of any fresh damage and obtain technical guidance.

Let us note that over 60% of India’s population would move from low-productive rural India to highly productive urban India by the 2060s. Clearly, the mobility of people on such a large scale within cities, from their residential quarters to work areas, will be a test for urban planners. While policymakers have plans to construct smart cities, where the need for the mobility of workers will be substantially reduced, the fact remains that, unlike China, we do not see many of the newly emerging smart cities coming of age. In contrast, the metros/existing tier 1 cities are on an ever-expanding spree, leading to rising challenges for policymakers, such as meeting the transportation demand of workers. The government is increasingly focused on augmenting the public transport system to meet the urban mobility challenge. This year’s Budget saw the launch of the PM e-Bus Sewa-Payment Security Mechanism, with the aim of improving urban bus transportation in India (nearly 10,000 urban buses). The PM Electric Drive Revolution in Innovative Vehicle Enhancement (PM e-Drive) scheme was introduced, which will support the procurement of 14,000 new e-buses, 1,10,000 e-rickshaws, e-trucks, and e-ambulances. However, according to estimates, India needs 2,00,000 urban buses, but only 35,000 are operational (including e-buses). This is far below the requirement. Another initiative has been the greater emphasis on building metro networks and a higher allocation of funds in multiple metro/tier I cities to cater to the high density. This is in line with the trend seen in the recent Budget. However, as the Economic Survey that was released on the eve of the Budget on January 31, has cited, only 37% of urban residents in India have easy access to public transportation.

She wishes to keep some money in liquid form but also expects it to grow. Please suggest options. Growth happens only in the long-term. Growth has scope only in equities and mutual funds and that too, only if the time horizon is much longer. Compounding is the key. The power of compounding does magic in any investment only if the money remains invested for at least 15 to 30 years. In the shorter period, say less than 7 to 10 years, it is difficult to gain good returns or see growth, what with market fluctuations and volatility. It is quite risky for her to invest retirement funds in either equities or mutual funds. Especially, with the current geopolitical tensions and market volatility, there are chances for loss of capital. Hence, it is better to stay away from these financial instruments. Your concern is to get higher returns. There are a few corporate bonds that can fetch interest rates of up to 11% or 12%. But investing in those instruments is risky and there is no guarantee of capital protection. At this age, the priority must be to protect the hard-earned capital and secure a reasonable interest.

195,2025,The Hindu,195,"The importance of Small Savings SchemesPremium Small Savings Schemes, kown as Post Office Savings Schemes, are a popular and useful means for people for channelising savings. Credit quality is top-notch as it is run by the government, and interest rates are competitive. Interest rates are fixed by the government every quarter e.g. the rates for the current quarter, April to June 2025, were announced on March 31. Today we will see, on what basis the rates are fixed by the government. As per an old decision of the Government, the rate of interest on Small Savings Schemes will be aligned with Government Security (G-Sec) rates of similar maturity with a spread i.e. mark-up. As an example, the spread on Senior Citizens Savings Scheme will be 1% over comparable maturity G-Secs. The rationale for linking it to G-Sec yields in the secondary market is that it is in line with interest rate movements; G-Sec yield movements reflect actual and anticipated economic events pertaining to interest rate movement. To clarify the concept, let us say the benchmark G-Sec rate is X% and the mark-up as per the formula is Y%. Hence, the rate should be X% plus Y%. However, if the rate is higher, say X% plus Y% plus Z%, then Z represents the generosity of the Government for the benefit of citizens. The rates on Small Savings Schemes are reviewed every quarter. However, rates are not revised downward every quarter even when G-Sec rates are sliding, which is the ‘Z’ referred earlier. Post Office Savings Deposit rate is 4%. Public Provident Fund (PPF), which is a 15-year scheme (though it can be extended), is supposed to have a spread of 25 basis points (100 bps = 1%). The relevant G-Sec rate (the average of G-Sec of corresponding maturity from December 2024 to February 2025) relevant for the quarter April to June, was 6.85%. By that logic, PPF rate is (6.85 + 0.25= 7.1%) maintained now. Post Office Term deposits of 1, 2 and 3-year maturity are to be at the corresponding G-Sec rate, without any markup. For a 5-year term deposit, the spread i",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/business/the-importance-of-small-savings-schemes/article69564993.ece

While these figures are for BE, RE show a drastic reduction in allocations. For instance, the ₹780 crore that was budgeted in FY21 was revised to ₹106 crore. Such over-estimations in BE and drastic downward revisions in RE can be seen across most years. In FY25, the allocation for the fund was estimated to be ₹520.51 crore and was revised in the following year to ₹160 crore. More importantly, the amount actually spent was even lower than the RE in most recent years. Despite an allocation of more than ₹600 crore in FY23, only ₹34.7 crore was actually spent on the modernisation of State police forces. This is about 6% of the allocation. Similarly, only 20-25% of the budgeted amounts were spent in FY21, FY23, and FY24.

Speaking to reporters ahead of the start of the Budget Session (2025-26), Mr. Adityanath said the governor's address and the presentation of the budget are crucial events where every member, including the opposition, can put forth their views effectively. ""Accusations or unparliamentary conduct cannot solve problems,"" he added. The Chief Minister assured that the government is fully prepared to respond factually to any issue the opposition raises. He said that the assembly should serve as a platform for meaningful discussions rather than being marred by baseless accusations or unruly conduct. Mr. Adityanath expressed confidence that the governor’s address would mark the beginning of a disciplined and constructive approach from the opposition. “We hope to see the opposition and all members conduct themselves in a manner that strengthens public faith in democratic values,” he said.

Union Agriculture Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said the budget will help in all-round development of the farm sector. The farmers’ organisations, however, are unhappy with the announcements and said the budget will lead to further rise in the input costs involved in farming. The allocation to the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare has come down by ₹ 3,905.05 crore when compared to the revised estimate of 2024-25. The allocation for the next financial year is ₹ 1,27,290.16 crore. In the revised estimates of 2024-25, the allocation for the Ministry was ₹1,31,195.21 crore. In the last budget, it was ₹ 1,22,528.77 crore. The main decrease is in the allocation towards the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, the coveted crop insurance scheme. In this budget the decrease in allocation for the PMFBY is ₹3,621.73 crore. The Centre has been claiming that more States have joined the scheme. In the last revised estimates, the scheme got ₹15,864 crore while in this budget, the allocation is ₹12,242.27 crore. The Fertilisers Department has also seen a cut in allocations, which is likely to impact the fertilisers subsidy.

200,2025,The Hindu,200,"Insuring rising cost of surgeryPremium Not long ago, a ₹10 lakh health insurance plan was deemed adequate. But no longer is it the case. Times have changed, and how! According to industry data, a kidney transplant that cost about ₹5 lakh in 2013 is now more than ₹18 lakh. A heart transplant that cost about ₹9.8 lakh a decade ago, now costs about ₹34 lakh. In fact, a study of medical cost trends from 2013 to 2025 showed that surgery costs had surged by up to 300% across the board. And it does not include post-operative care or long-term rehabilitation. It is fair to say that this is not a minor spike but a structural shift in healthcare economics. Now, a pertinent question is: Is my health insurance coverage growing at the same pace? By the time most of us reach our mid-40s, we have usually ticked all the important financial planning boxes: home loan, term cover and of course, health insurance. This most likely includes a ₹10-15 lakh health policy for the family. But here’s the uncomfortable truth: While healthcare costs have moved on, most of our insurance policies haven’t. The reason is that medical inflation in India outpaces general inflation by a significant margin. Currently, India’s retail inflation is at 3.34%. That is quite low, but on average, it hovers around 5-6%. However, medical inflation in urban India has been about 14% for a while. It is true that new-age surgical technologies are improving outcomes, but they are also pushing up the cost of medical care. For instance, what used to be a ₹70,000 angioplasty 10 years ago now costs almost ₹2.5 lakh. A routine knee replacement can set you back by ₹5-6 lakh, while cancer treatment costs vary widely. But one thing is certain - they can be financially devastating sans insurance. The costliest part apart from the surgery itself is diagnostics, pre- and post-hospitalisation, ICU, medication and long-term follow-ups. A ₹10 lakh cover may look adequate on paper, but a single surgery can wipe it out.

201,2025,The Hindu,201,"India needs to design an inclusive pension systemPremium Pensions are essential for maintaining economic stability and dignity after retirement. Retirees often face financial instability due to reduced earning capacity, rising health-care costs, and inflation, necessitating a safety net in the form of pensions. The Economic Survey 2025-26 reports that Indian pension assets amount to just 17% of GDP, compared with up to 80% in many advanced economies. Currently, only around 12% of India’s workforce is covered by formal pension schemes. The coverage is also disproportionate, with public sector and organised private sector workers being protected under multiple parallel schemes. In contrast, the only protection for the informal sector is voluntary adoption under the National Pension System and Atal Pension Yojana. These two schemes accounted for about 5.3 % of the total population in FY24. Integrate the informal sector Notably, almost 85% of the informal labour force is generating more than half of the country’s GDP. As markets evolve, the gig economy will only expand further. Their exclusion from the pension framework is not only a policy gap but also a looming financial crisis in the making. By 2050, India’s old-age dependency ratio will increase to 30%. Consequently, India’s path to achieve developed economy status by 2047 will depend, in no small measure, on our efforts to secure the future against old-age poverty. Currently, the expansion of pension coverage is hindered by issues that are linked to scalability, sensitisation, and sustainability. The primary reason for the exclusion of informal workers from the pension framework is the fragmented nature of pension schemes. Although the government has introduced social security for gig workers, funded in part by aggregators, this only addresses a fraction of the informal sector and adds another parallel scheme to an already complex web. On the contrary, most mature economies have a well-structured pension ecosystem with multiple tiers that cater to the diverse needs of th",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/design-an-inclusive-pension-system/article69705925.ece

As this writer engages with industry leaders, both big and small, the more I realise the depth of this change, which compels me to write again on the subject, unfolding its newer dimensions. This is a historic stride in simplifying the GST. Having worked on indirect taxes for decades, I can say with confidence that the scale of reform, and its implications for consumers, micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSME), industry and the wider economy, are immense. From the moment the reforms were announced, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) moved quickly. Its advocacy on GST 2.0, since December 2024, through reports, studies, multiple governmental engagements at the central and State levels, and press releases had consistently highlighted the need for rate rationalisation, simpler classification, and reduced compliance friction. MSMEs had shared their struggles over classification disputes, high taxes on essentials, inverted duty structures and cumbersome procedures. Many of these concerns were decisively addressed on September 3. The reforms collapse the old four-slab structure (5%, 12%, 18% and 28%) into a simpler set: a low rate of around 5% for essentials, 18% as the standard, and 40% for luxury and sin goods. Numerous daily-use items — household goods, toiletries, and small appliances — have been shifted to lower slabs. Just as important, procedural simplifications have been introduced: stock adjustments without complete relabelling, clearer classification norms, faster refunds and easier compliance for small firms. For consumers, the benefits are direct and visible. Goods that earlier attracted 12% or 18% tax will now face 5% or less. In her interviews, the Finance Minister underlined the point that “99% of goods and services will now fall under zero, 5% or 18%, with only 1% in the lu",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/getting-gst-20-to-run-like-a-well-oiled-machine/article70085502.ece

They are labelled passionfruit kombucha, dragon fruit kombucha, mango kombucha, and so on, connected to a 10-litre metal keg inside the cooler. Pull down the black lever; a vibrant, fizzy beverage gushes down the metal tap, foaming in a paper cup. This beer keg-inspired apparatus mainly aims at first timers, who are “hesitant” to try the subtly sour beverage made from naturally fermented tea, says Anu Vijayan, who runs the outlet store. “Some people are doubtful about trying a kombucha, so they might not want to buy a 300 ml bottle.

212,2025,The Hindu,212,"A green advantage in tractor exportsPremium The government’s recent decision to cut the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate on tractors to 5% is a timely boost for farmers and manufacturers alike. Lower costs are expected to accelerate mechanisation at home, contributing to a stronger domestic manufacturing base to support exports abroad. Yet the global regulatory landscape for such exports is shifting fast, as increasingly stringent emissions standards come into effect in the world’s leading markets. India faces a defining choice: cling to low-cost competitiveness or pivot boldly towards cleaner, higher-value machines that can command global markets. Tractors are the backbone of Indian agriculture. They are used to plough, sow, harvest, irrigate, transport produce, and manage crop residue. Their versatility across crops and terrains has made them indispensable, reducing drudgery and ensuring timely operations. This robust domestic base has propelled India to become a leading global supplier, with tractor exports totaling $1.15 billion and reaching 162 countries in 2024–25. But with growing volumes come growing externalities: an analysis by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) found that emissions from tractors and other non-road equipment in India are projected to surpass those from road vehicles by 2030. Policy has already begun to shift this trajectory. As discussed in a previous ICCT analysis, India’s leap to Bharat Stage (TREM) IV standards for agricultural tractors in 2023 slashed the regulatory limit for particulate emissions by up to 94%, nearly closing the gap with the norms of the United States and European Union. By April 2026, Bharat Stage (TREM) V standards will bring most Indian tractors in line with U.S. Tier 4f and EU Stage V requirements. These reforms aren’t just environmental milestones; they are trade strategies.

There is much to learn in this context from the most successful experiment in atmanirbharata in the past, which was the achievement of food self-sufficiency in the 1960s.M.S. Swaminathanwas the man who did it and he was a living hero to all of us. This is the centenary year of his birth and it has seen the publication of a new biography,M.S. Swaminathan: the Man who Fed India, by Priyambada Jayakumar. Ms. Jayakumar had the benefit of detailed discussions with him on both the personal and professional side of his life and she has produced a book which is a great read. However, in this article, I will focus on some lessons from his experience which have relevance for the future. Scientific advancement was at the core of the Green Revolution and the book brings out that such advances are not achieved by dedicated scientists working in isolation in a lab. They involve collaboration with other scientists and a cross-fertilisation of ideas. It was known that wheat productivity could be increased through application of fertilizers and other inputs, but the problem was that the higher weight of grains caused the plant to bend and lodge if the stalk was not strong enough. Swaminathan was trying to use radiation to develop a genetic mutation that would have a stronger stalk, but this approach was not getting anywhere. M.S.

In a memorandum to the Chairperson of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Commerce, the NECSTGA pointed out that the woes of small tea growers need to be addressed as they accounted for 52% of India’s total tea production. The association’s president, Diganta Phukan, and secretary general, Binod Buragohain, said the quality of tea has been deteriorating because certain players blended poor quality teas, and unscrupulous agents acted as a bridge between small tea growers and bought leaf factories. A bought leaf factory is a tea processing plant not associated with any estate or plantation group. A bought tea factory produces granular or orthodox teas, largely from leaves procured from small tea growers through agents or suppliers. “More than 90% of the leaves are transported to the BLFs (bought leaf factories) by the agents, and 50% of these leaves are damaged during transportation,” the NECSTGA said, lamenting that small tea growers do not get the right prices because the bought leaf factories pay for the leaves through these agents. “All agents should be regulated by the Tea Board of India through a monitoring mechanism,” the association said, calling for transparency in the supply chain to maintain the quality of tea. Referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s avowed focus on the northeastern region, the NECSTGA said the Centre should treat tea like other crops, including paddy and wheat, and come up with a minimum or sustainable support price policy. The small tea growers, in particular, have been finding it tough to stay afloat due to the increasing cost of production.

217,2025,The Hindu,217,"Why is India not importing corn from the U.S.? | Explained The story so far: Among the key areas of disagreement between the U.S. and India regarding trade is a demand that India should import U.S. corn. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said that India has 1.4 billion people but does not import a single bushel of corn from the U.S. (25 kg approximately). India’s maize yield is quite poor and is below four tonnes per hectare whereas the world average is six tonnes. Despite that, India had been largely self-sufficient and has sometimes even exported maize,  mainly for poultry and other livestock feed as well as for human consumption. With the ramp up of ethanol blending of petrol, India has had to balance between its food needs and ethanol production. For instance, it has to decide between sugar manufacture versus diverting sugarcane products to ethanol production. Similarly, India has also had to ramp up maize feedstock for ethanol production. This Kharif-Rabi-Spring season, the maize crop is expected to supply some 10 to 12 million tonnes for ethanol production out of an overall 50 million tonnes production, says H.S. Jat, Director of the ICAR-Indian Institute of Maize Research in Ludhiana. He adds that there will not be any need to import maize this year given the bounty crop expected. India has, however, been importing maize in recent times, apparently for ethanol. For instance, overall maize imports were some one million tonnes in 2024-25 (60% from Myanmar and much of the rest from Ukraine). This represents an almost eight times increase over the previous year. India doesn’t import U.S. corn, much of which is Genetically Modified (GM). India has allowed only GM cotton cultivation, with GM brinjal and mustard cultivation remaining in the investigation stage. Some critics say that fears over cultivating GM crops such as alleged toxicity and diseases will apply to imported GM corn produce as well if it enters the food chain.

The State has emerged as the top producer of processed potatoes in India, followed by Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. The processed potato segment in Gujarat accounts for over 25% of the State’s total potato production. The remaining crop includes table varieties such as Kufri, which are commonly used in household cooking. Of the processed output, approximately 60% is used for wafer production and 40% for French fries. “In 2004–2005, India produced less than 1 lakh tonnes of processed potatoes across 4,000 hectares. As of 2024–25, the production has risen to 11.50 lakh tonnes cultivated across 37,000 hectares. The increase reflects a tenfold rise in production and a ninefold increase in cultivation area,” officials said. Banaskantha, Sabarkantha, and Aravalli are the leading districts in Gujarat for potato cultivation. In the 2024–25 season, these three districts together produced 38 lakh tonnes of potatoes over 1.19 lakh hectares, with an average productivity of 32.36 tonnes per hectare. Banaskantha recorded the highest production with 18.70 lakh tonnes from 61,016 hectares at a productivity rate of 30.65 tonnes per hectare.

Swaminathan Annual Award for Food and Peace last week, toldThe Hinduin an interview that every government should engage all the key stakeholders and come up with appropriate policy to mitigate the crisis from unnecessary tariffs being imposed on developing countries. “If you don’t have a policy in place that can mitigate this crisis, then it’s going to be very, very difficult,” he said, adding that governments were not doing enough to improve the quality of farmers and farm products within the system so that imports could be restricted. An expert in Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) technology, Prof. Adenle said a strong base in scientific research, proper regulatory mechanisms and adequate legal systems could allay the concerns over the use of GM crops. Prof. Adenle said global agriculture was facing a lot of challenges such as land degradation, climate change, poverty, water scarcity etc. and technology was going to play a big role in fighting these problems. He said destruction of food systems during conflicts, war and trade imbalance and other factors were leading to supply chain disruptions, price hikes, shortages, and instability in local and global markets. “The most important aspect of that is to look at the policy, at the national, regional and international level,” he said. Terming the recent tariffs announced by United States President Donald Trump as a manifestation of trade imbalance, Prof. Adenle said Mr. Trump was increasing tariffs by 20 to 50% on some countries. “If you don’t have an existing policy that addresses long-time effect of tariffs, that is being imposed by another country, then it becomes a problem. It becomes a crisis. You must have a very comprehensive policy that mitigates effects of other policies from other countries. Otherwise, the response will be retaliatory — doing the same thing.

On November 25, the Assam government tabled the Assam Fixation of Ceiling on Land Holdings (Amendment) Bill, 2025, aimed at removing labour lines from the “ancillary land” category in tea estates. This would guarantee “land protection” for 3.33 lakh tea worker families across 825 tea estates in the State, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said. Labour lines are rows of dwellings for plantation workers in specified sections of a tea estate. The CCPA, which covers tea, coffee, rubber, and cardamom planters, pointed out that the Assam Plantation Labour Rules exclude the earmarking of any garden land to be apportioned as “patta” to be distributed. It also said that labour quarters and line areas are part of the statutory facilities mandated under the Plantation Labour Act, 1951, and cannot be converted into transferable land ownership. The planters’ body said the State government had acquired large areas from the tea gardens under the Assam Fixation of Ceiling on Land Holdings Act, 1956, and allowed these estates to retain land only for special cultivation of tea and ancillary purposes (factory, houses, hospitals, etc.). “...the land now available with the tea estates is residual land after surrendering the surplus land. Therefore, any further acquisition would adversely affect the long-term viability of the tea sector...,” the CCPA said. It, however, said that if any estate land is acquired, compensation must follow the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. The proposed amendment law prescribes compensation, but under its relevant section.

Seated on the low wall of a village well, she opens her lunch box, tears a piece of jonna rotte (jowar roti) and eats it with mango pickle under the noonday sun. “We are innocent, illiterate women,” she says, recalling how they were once drawn into a new world of sanghams (voluntary village-level associations) and savings. “They told us we could save, take loans, stand on our feet. So we believed and started saving — first ₹1 a week, then ₹5,” adds the mother of four. For over four decades, the Deccan Development Society (DDS) helped transform the lives of Dalit women across Telangana’s arid Zaheerabad mandal (Medak). The agri-based voluntary organisation turned fallow land into food, built homes, created seed banks, ran alternative public distribution systems and drew global recognition for its community-led model. It was a story of transformation, and pride. But now, that pride has curdled into pain and suspicion. Women like Rangamma who helped build the movement are raising difficult questions — about missing savings, land deals and the lack of transparency in the very institution they helped build. Beyond the spanking wide roads of western Hyderabad, beyond the skyscrapers of the Indian Institute of Technology-Hyderabad, and beside the Bidar-Hyderabad road is a green oasis — Pastapur village in Zaheerabad mandal. Speckled with two-storey houses, gabled roofs and farmlands, the village is just another prosperous settlement in Telangana. But beneath its serene surface lies a story of struggle, solidarity and simmering doubt. Under the leadership of P.V. Satheesh, the DDS became a nationally and internationally recognised model for grassroots development and millet revival.

226,2025,The Hindu,226,"A ban, a split verdict, and a health concernPremium Rapeseed-mustard oil (hereafter ‘mustard oil’) is the third-largest edible oil consumed in India. Two executive and judicial decisions on mustard oil — one from 2021 and another from 2024 — have major public health implications, but have hardly received the public attention and scrutiny they deserve. In the first decision, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) prohibited the manufacturing and sale of blended mustard oil in India, effective from June 8, 2021. As per Indian food safety laws, selling an edible oil mixed with another edible oil is permitted, provided the proportion of an oil blended with another oil is within 20%. Reports suggest that FSSAI’s ban decision was aimed at preventing the adulteration of mustard oil and boosting domestic mustard crop output. In the second, the Supreme Court ruled on July 23, 2024, against approval granted by the Central government for the environmental release of India’s indigenously developed genetically modified (GM) mustard named Dhara Mustard Hybrid-11 (DMH-11). A major ground on which one of the two judges pronounced a judgment against DMH-11 was the insufficient assessment of the impact on human health of DMH-11. A common policy goal behind these two decisions was to protect the health of Indian mustard oil consumers. However, a closer look at the facts shows that this goal cannot be fully achieved through these two decisions. The mustard oil extracted from the Indian mustard crop contains high levels of a unique fatty acid called erucic acid (40% to 54% of total fatty acid). This is significantly higher than the internationally accepted level of <5%. Mustard oil containing high erucic acid is considered undesirable for human consumption, particularly in advanced countries such as the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Lab experiments demonstrated that animals fed with high erucic acid-containing mustard oil suffered from heart diseases, retarded growth, premature tissue death, and adverse changes to the liver",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/a-ban-a-split-verdict-and-a-health-concern/article69652167.ece

Senior officials informed Union Agriculture Minister Mr. Chouhan in the meeting that there has been an increase in the sowing of onion and potato too in 2024-25 as compared to 2023-24. “There has been an increase of 2.82 lakh hectares in onion sowing, which is an increase from 9.76 lakh hectares in 2023-24 to 12.58 lakh hectares in 2024-25. The sowing area of ​​​​potato has also increased by 0.47 lakh hectares,” the Ministry said in a statement after the meeting. The sowing of tomato and onion is under way smoothly in the current season, according to the Ministry. Sowing of the three crops are going on in this season. The meeting also reviewed the weather conditions and the availability of water in reservoirs. “The total water storage situation is better than last year.

Over the decades, India has witnessed remarkable growth in aquatic food production that is driven by technological innovation, institutional support and proactive policy measures. Yet, the sector faces critical challenges. Overfishing, habitat degradation, water pollution and climate change are straining aquatic ecosystems. Small-scale fishers and farmers often lack access to finance, technology and markets, while poor traceability and inadequate post-harvest measures limit taping of the best export and domestic market potential and compromise food security. On World Fisheries Day 2025 (November 21), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) calls for a renewed commitment to India’s Blue Revolution and supports the Government of India’s theme this year, which is “India’s Blue Transformation: Strengthening Value Addition in Seafood Exports”. According to the FAO State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture (SOFIA) 2024, global capture fisheries produced 92.3 million tonnes in 2022, while aquaculture reached a record 130.9 million tonnes, valued at $313 billion. India contributed 10.23 million tonnes of aquatic animals, making it the world’s second-largest aquaculture producer. India’s aquatic food production, encompassing capture fisheries and aquaculture, has risen from 2.44 million tonnes in the 1980s to 17.54 million tonnes in 2022-23.

229,2025,The Hindu,229,"Trouble in ‘soy State’: Madhya Pradesh soybean farmers lose interest over multiple factorsPremium Arvind Singh Rathore was born in 1989, which was the year before his grandfather, (late) Thakur Datar Singh Rathore, and his father, Thakur Santosh Singh Rathore, began cultivating soybean on their ancestral farmland in Muradpura, a village on the outskirts of Indore in Madhya Pradesh. The oilseed was quite new to farmers in this area even though others in the State had been sowing it as far back as the late 1970s and early 1980s. Arvind grew up helping his family earn a living growing soybean. For about 15 years now, he has been managing soybean on 25 acres of land, with the help of his father. But something has changed. The young farmer, also a district leader of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh-supported Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, now wants to leave agriculture and look for another job in another sector. The reasons are many. Even as the harvesting of soybean was going on, he found time to talk about some of the reasons. He said youngsters like him were no longer interested in farming due to multiple issues that ranged from climate change to the import-export policies of the Union Government. “The yield is very low this time,” he said. “We get two quintals to 2.5 quintals per acre now. There was a time when we used to get more than four quintals. This is less than half of what my grandfather and father used to get. The price is also almost a ₹1,000 less than what we used to get 15 years ago. We do not have any other alternative crops here as maize, a popular alternate crop, is what the nilgai likes.” The nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus) is an antelope species which farmers consider to be a nuisance as it destroys crops, Arvind pointed out. Arvind has also been reaching out to his farmer friends on the impact that the possible import of soybean from the United States could have. “The government is already importing soybean oil and other edible oils. But if soybean is imported from the U.S., our crisis will deepen.

Speaking at an event on the ecological degradation of the Himalayan range and its impact on the Indian subcontinent, Mr. Joshi criticised one of the dream projects of the Narendra Modi-led Union government — the all-weather roads along the route of the Char Dham yatra in Uttarakhand. Roads are being recklessly made in the hills, he said. This comes two months after Mr. Joshi and several other eminent personalities, including Congress MP Karan Singh, wrote to the then-Chief Justice of India B.R. Gavai requesting him to review the Supreme Court’s 2021 judgement that allowed Char Dham roads to be widened beyond 5.5 metres. The Char Dham all-weather road project involves widening the mountain roads that lead to the Char Dham temples, including the shrines at Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri, and Yamunotri. This also includes the roads in the Bhagirathi Eco Sensitive Zone (BESZ), and some roads leading to India’s border with China. In an affidavit submitted in the SC, the Ministry of Defence had said that there is an immediate need for double-laned roads to meet border security concerns in the hills. “It’s important to save borders but saving Himlayas is equally important,” Mr. Joshi said at the event, convened to suggest solutions and policy measures to mitigate the situation. RSS joint general secretary Krishna Gopal, also present at the event, hailed the contribution of Ganga activist G.D. Agarwal in highlighting the role and importance of the Himalayas. He also pointed out that recent landslides in hills have once again highlighted the importance of preserving the Himalayas. “The landslides that occurred in last one year in which projects worth billions got washed away and hundreds were killed has highlighted the very importance of preserving Himalayas.

Through an order dated November 11, 2025, the Supreme Court, based on consent given by the ED, restored the said deposit to Lodha Developers Limited under the provisions of Section 8(8) of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, an official of the agency said. “The Hon’ble Supreme Court placed on record its appreciation for the earnest efforts made by the officers of the Directorate of Enforcement in restoring the attached properties to secure the interests of justice,” the official said. Investigations had revealed that Cox & Kings Ltd. and its promoters allegedly siphoned off about ₹4,100 crore from public sector banks, according to the agency. From that amount, ₹1,066 crore was transferred to V Hotels Ltd., of which ₹520.80 crore remained outstanding. “To recover the proceeds of crime, the ED attached the immovable properties standing in the name of V Hotels Ltd. to the tune of ₹520.80 crore.

The SKM said such an agreement could lead to opening up of agriculture, dairy and food markets and that will hurt the interests of the people. “The FTA is supposed to come into effect by August 1, 2025. August 9 is the 83rd anniversary of the Quit India Day movement against British colonialism.

In 2021, the authorities of the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR) turned to Europe for a project to elevate the traditional system of pig farming with scientific inputs. The outcome was the Bodoland Pig Mission, a collaboration of the BTR government with the Netherlands-based Programma Uitzending Managers (PUM) and Denmark’s Danish Consortium of Academic Craftsmanship (DCAC). After initiating the process to upgrade existing infrastructure and training 115 farmers on pig breeding and scientific farm management, the project is taking shape with a British breed of domestic pigs — the Large White Yorkshire — being brought from the Netherlands. Pushpadhar Das, an Officer on Special Duty associated with the mission, said 260 Large White Yorkshires — 250 sows and 10 boars — are destined for a nucleus pig breeding farm coming up at the Dakhin Maithabari village in Baksa, one of five districts of the 8,970 sq. km BTR. The PUM is providing technical support to this farm, the first of its kind in the northeast. “We are bringing the British breed because we don’t get a pure breed here. We expect the pigs from the Netherlands in January 2026 after the construction of the Baksa nucleus breeding farm is over in the next three months,” he said.

The Court invoked separation of powers to reject timelines and Article 142’s use, but this empowers Governors at the cost of State rights. The judgment claims that Articles 200 and 201 prescribe no deadlines, but disregards explicit constitutional text. In Article 200, the Governor must declare his decision “as soon as possible” — the Court called it too “elastic” to support timelines, rendering constitutional text unenforceable.

241,2025,The Hindu,241,"Sting in the tail: on Cyclone Ditwah, its impact During its slow crawl over Sri Lanka in November,Cyclone Ditwah was a rain machinethat repeatedly swept over the same areas for days, eventually precipitatinga national disaster with widespread flooding. Fourteen lakh people were affected, and at least 474 were killed. After crossing Sri Lanka, the system re-entered the Bay of Bengal and briefly reintensified, bringing heavy rains to north Tamil Nadu and south Andhra Pradesh. By December 1, the storm’s remnant parked itself off Chennai’s coast as a deep depression. The next day, after around 18 cm of rain over 24 hours,the city woke to flooded streets and widespread waterlogging. While that much rain would test any urban drainage system, public frustration has mounted. That Ditwah was tricky to predictmade matters worse. Chennai’s storm water network has been rebuilt and extended after the 2015 floods, and again since 2023, but it cannot be flood-proof. Integrated projects in local basins are designed to handle intense bursts rather than hours of heavy rain. The GCC has said that it has spent ₹5,200 crore over four years to add around 1,100 km of new drains, with three-fourths of the work done. A separate endeavour to fix smaller broken links is incomplete, leaving many streets waterlogged. Chennai’s flat layout, increasing paved area, and the three rivers running through it from catchments in Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram also mean that when a storm system inundates those basins and Chennai together, water levels will rise quickly. Recent floods in north Chennai exposed the encroachment and shoddy desilting of the Kosasthalaiyar. With its ability to tolerate flooding diminished, the GCC had to shut some drains and pump stagnant waters against reverse flow. By lingering near Chennai, the new storm had similar effects. The Thiruppugazh Committee appointed after the 2021 floods produced a 600-page report with basin-wise recommendations and numerous measures.

The symbolism was high this year. It is 10 years since theParis Agreementwas signed by 195 countries — a pact to ensure that the globe did not heat up beyond 2°C of pre-industrial times and, as far as possible, contain it to 1.5°C. That was a goal easier stated than done; 2024 ended up being the first time that temperatures breached the 1.5°C territory though it will require several more such transgressions for 1.5°C to be the ‘new normal’. In all the years since, COPs have been about systematically getting all countries to move on the path of restructuring their economies away from their fossil-fuel hardwiring; apportioning responsibility — and finance — in ways to actualise these goals, and finally work towards addressing the damage that climate change had already done to societies, livelihoods and ecologies. While there has been success, in that most countries — even the United States — recognise that renewables are the future of energy, it has been challenging for countries to execute the transformation while also growing their economies and keeping their competitive edges sharp. This has led to the formation of the two broad blocs — one led by developed countries and affiliated allies that has pushed for hard targets and road maps to phase out fossil fuels, and the other by developing countries or petro states who reject such prescription and demand more money and action from the developed countries. The Brazil COP sought to bring a change in the narrative bystressing ‘implementation’, and reminding the world that multilateralism and ‘mutirão’ (coming together) were indispensable to the Paris Agreement.

245,2025,The Hindu,245,"​Data deficiencies: On India and the IMF’s low grading TheIMF’s ‘C’ grade for India’s national accounts statisticsshould be a matter of concern for India, which has a reasonably robust data collection and analysis apparatus in place. A ‘C’ grade is the second lowest there is, and implies that there are some issues with the data that impede the adequate surveillance of the economy. National accounts not only include zoomed out macro indicators such as GDP and GVA but also sectoral metrics and measures of investment levels, consumer spending and — of particular interest right now — how exports are doing. Issues with these metrics, therefore, impede effective and targeted policymaking. A grade of ‘C’ puts India in the same league as China when it comes to its national accounts, a decidedly unenviable position to be in. The IMF is not the first to point out the flaws in India’s national accounts. Nor is this the first time that it has pointed them out. The IMF’s main problem with the national accounts data, that its base year of 2011-12 is very outdated, has been pointed out time and again. Outdated data is a problem India has been grappling with for a while now. The Index of Industrial Production and the Consumer Price Index both have a base year of 2011-12. In fact, even the IMF said the reason that India’s CPI received a grade of ‘B’ and not ‘A’ was because of the outdated base year. The outdated base year and the inordinate weightage of food in the CPI have resulted in India not being able to accurately capture price movements. Consequently, the RBI’s monetary policy is also impaired. The government is currently in the process of updating the base years and methodologies for national accounts, CPI, and IIP, with the new series due to be launched in early 2026. Perhaps the biggest issue with the national accounts statistics in India — and the area that requires the most attention — is the inability to accurately capture the informal sector.

Passed by Parliament between 2019 and 2020, the implementation of these Codes was delayed for multiple reasons. TheCodes replace 29 lawsthat regulated employer-employee relations, and significantly reduce the compliance requirements for a company every year. The Centre has maintained that it will hand-hold the States to draft and adopt the Rules in accordance with the Codes — most States and Union Territories have published the draft Rules for the Codes. Free market advocates have always considered India’s labour laws to be a hindrance to its growth potential. Under the Codes, worker-employer relations, social security mechanism and wage and aspects of emoluments will witness huge changes. India needs to generate employment for its growing youth population as it is estimated that 12 million people attain working age every year. This is a trend that will hold for several years. TheEconomic Survey of 2023-24noted that there needs to be an average of nearly 78.5 lakh jobs created annually until 2030 in the non-farm sector to engage the rising workforce. Despite the long delay in the implementation of the Codes, the concerns raised by labour unions have not been addressed in full. Labour representatives allege that the government ignored the pro-worker recommendations of the Second National Commission on Labour, (submitted in 2002) and, instead, accommodated all “pro employer” recommendations and made them a part of the Codes.

JD(U) supremoNitish Kumar retains the post of Chief Minister, even though his party finished second to the BJP in theAssembly election. However, for the first time in his nearly 20 years as Chief Minister, he is not in charge of the Home Department. Samrat Choudhary, one of the two BJP Deputy Chief Ministers, now controls this administratively powerful ministry. Vijay Kumar Sinha, the other Deputy Chief Minister, has been assigned revenue, land reforms, mines and geology, further consolidating the BJP’s control over critical administrative levers. The BJP holds 14 of the 26 ministerial berths and controls key departments including health, law, road construction, urban development, and agriculture. The BJP has effectively taken a decisive step in formally inverting the hierarchy of its alliance with the JD(U) in its favour. While the BJP was the larger party even in 2020, Nitish Kumar retained crucial ministries. The social justice plank and the composition of the previous Assembly gave the JD(U) room to keep an alliance with the RJD open. But the overwhelming sweep of the National Democratic Alliance this time has not only placed the BJP firmly on top but has also made any exploration of alternatives by the JD(U) difficult, if not impossible. Nitish Kumar is battling ill-health; while he remains indispensable for the BJP, the party is also carefully planning its long-term path. It has built a wide and deep caste coalition, seeking to reach communities that have traditionally viewed the JD(U) as their platform.

The move is another unmistakable sign that India wants to be seen as a sports destination of repute. The choice of Ahmedabad as the host city is strategic too, for India has submitted theLetter of Intent to hold the 2036 Olympicswith Ahmedabad as the front-runner. However, while theOlympicsretains its allure and grandeur, the CWG has been beset with difficulties. Once signifying the imperial unity of the British empire, the CWG is struggling for relevance in the post-colonial world. Successive host cities have dropped out citing rising costs –Birmingham replaced Durban in 2022; Glasgow has come to the rescue for 2026 after theAustralian State of Victoria withdrew, and Ahmedabad has stepped in for the Canadian province of Alberta. Not so long ago, India itself was cold to the competition, with the then Indian Olympic Association president Narinder Batra, in 2019, calling it “sub-standard” — albeit in his personal capacity — and strongly pitching for India’s withdrawal. Also, when New Delhi conducted the Games in 2010, there were allegations galore of large-scale corruption and incompetence. So, what merit does India see now? First, it is an important soft-power medium. Second, the nation’s sporting aspirations have grown manifold, and though performances by its sportspersons have not kept pace, there is a genuine push toward diversifying on-field excellence and going beyond just cricket.

251,2025,The Hindu,251,"​Limited room: On the Indian rupee Between late November 2024 and now, the rupee has depreciated about 7%,sliding from roughly ₹83.4 a dollar to about ₹89.2. This is not unprecedented as in 2018, it slid 11%-12% against the dollar. The comparison is instructive because the political and trade backdrops have echoes of that earlier period. In 2018, during the first term of U.S. President Donald Trump, global dollar strength, rising U.S. interest rates and trade tensions pressured emerging market currencies, including the rupee. The RBI used its first longer-term currency-swap as a systemic liquidity check. In 2019, it completed a $5 billion three-year dollar/rupee swap. And in February 2025, it carried out a $10 billion dollar/rupee buy-sell swap auction to infuse long-term rupee liquidity into the banking system under global stress. Such swaps are a standard tool by central banks to supply liquidity, shore up forex reserves and prevent disorderly currency depreciation when the dollar surges or capital flows reverse. The steep rupee slide in November arises in a context of external pressures — a widening current-account deficit, driven partly by higher imports of bullion, as a hedge in uncertain times, and exporters scrambling to maintain competitiveness amid high U.S. trade tariffs. In such a hostile global macro-environment, the RBI’s mandate is limited: under the floating-but-managed regime, it can only ‘smoothen volatility’ rather than fix the exchange rate. Between November last year and now, the RBI sold a net of roughly $50 billion in forex to stabilise the rupee. Even so, the slide has proceeded, highlighting the external pressures. That said, there is room for cautious optimism. India’s foreign exchange reserves are comfortable — close to $693 billion.

The Supreme Court of India’s intervention to battle stigma and discrimination in the case of leprosy is a corrective action that could not have been delayed any further. On a direction from the Court, the NHRC recently submitted that 97 central and State laws continue to contain provisions thatdiscriminate against persons with leprosy. In sum and substance, these provisions deny access to things as basic as public transport and public spaces, right to run for elected office, and access to employment, or running a business venture. The Court was hearing a batch of petitions contending that there were a number of provisions across central and State statutes that discriminate against persons with leprosy. Caused mainly by the bacterium, Mycobacterium leprae, leprosy is among the earliest known infections to affect humans, with skeletal evidence dating back to 2000 BCE. Today, India continues to report about 57 % of leprosy cases worldwide, with genetic predisposition and living in unsanitary conditions raising the susceptibility. The NHRC, which has been in pursuit of this issue since 2021, first put out a comprehensive document that recommended early identification, timely treatment, rehabilitation, and removing discriminatory practices to ensure dignity and equal access to fundamental rights for persons with leprosy. This includes a plea to the Centre to enact a law to replace derogatory terminology that persists in the laws of the land, and a pointed recommendation to the Unique Identification Authority of India to promote the use of iris scans for Aadhaar enrolment, as leprosy primarily affects the fingertips, through nerve damage.

This was the first time a sitting Japanese Prime Minister made an explicit remark about Japan’s stance on a potential Chinese military action in Taiwan, marking a sharp departure from the cautious strategic ambiguity that Tokyo had long maintained. An enragedChina has demandedthat Ms. Takaichi retract her remarks, and has banned Japanese seafood imports and issued travel advisories to its citizens to avoid Japan. China has also claimed that Japan is planning to deploy missiles on Yonaguni island near Taiwan, calling it “an extremely dangerous move”. Chinese Coast Guard vessels are also patrolling the waters around the disputed Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, actions Japan says violate its territorial waters. Beijing has warned that any Japanese military intervention in Taiwan would be treated as an act of aggression. China’s anger is not entirely unfounded. Japan’s colonial legacy still casts a long shadow over the region. From 1895 to 1945, Taiwan lived under Japanese occupation following the Treaty of Shimonoseki. Japan’s brutal occupation of parts of China left wounds that are still raw in Chinese collective memory. Taiwan was returned to Chinese control after Japan was defeated in the Second World War, but became a separate administrative entity when the Kuomintang retreated there following the communist revolution of 1949.

While theSupreme Court continues to hearchallenges to the constitutionality of the SIR process pioneered in Bihar, the same flawed approach is being persisted with in other States. Voters are tofill enumeration formsdelivered by Booth Level Officers (BLO) and match their details against electoral rolls from 2002-2005. Thoughdata from Bihar suggest that the process did not dramatically alter election outcomes, it saw a sharp decline in the gender ratio of the electorate. Other localised distortions also warrant concern. The ECI claims that enumeration forms have been delivered to most electors in the 12 States and UTs, but genuine voters continue to scramble for forms, and confusion persists about thedocumentation requiredfor enrolment on the draft rolls due next month. The guideline mandating that BLOs visit households appears to be only on paper. The Gauhati High Court, in Dr. Manmohan Singh (1999), interpreted requirements in the Representation of the People Act, 1950 expansively: an ordinary resident is a habitual resident with the intention to dwell permanently — whom any reasonable person would accept as a resident of that place. Operating from this principle, the ECI and the judiciary have historically presumed that any resident adult was, by default, a valid voter. The SIR inverts this presumption. Regardless of having voted earlier, every elector mustnow prove their legitimacyagainst old records or documents listed by the ECI. This shifting of the burden, from the state to citizens, risks major disenfranchisement, especially married women and migrants, as in Bihar.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke at all three sessions of the G-20, suggesting six initiatives that India could lead in order to address some of those issues, particularly on the need to “reconsider” the parameters of global development. Theseinitiativesincluded a Traditional Knowledge Repository, a G20-Africa Skills Multiplier Initiative (where India proposed to train a million people across Africa), a Global Healthcare Response Team, an Initiative on Countering the Drug–Terror Nexus, an “Open Satellite Data Partnership” to share agriculture, fishing and disaster-related information, and a “G20 Critical Minerals Circularity initiative”.

256,2025,The Hindu,256,"Goa | Serendipity’s decade shift, and what to expect at the arts festival this year Sunil Kant Munjal remembers the moment precisely. During Serendipity Arts Festival’s (SAF) 2024 edition, he watched a local fisherman’s family spend an entire afternoon at Thukral & Tagra’sNafrat/Parvahinstallation, where visitors exchanged packages of hate for acts of care, such as a haircut. The grandmother, who had never attended an “art event” before, told him it reminded her of communal rituals from her village. “That’s when you realise art isn’t alien to anyone,” Munjal, SAF’s founder-patron, reflects. “It’s the contexts we create that either invite or exclude.” Ten years after it first began as a fairly outré and small cultural gathering, Serendipity Arts Festival isn’t fringe any more — it’s an institution. When Munjal and his team launched Serendipity in 2016, sceptics questioned whether a free, large-scale interdisciplinary platform could sustain itself while maintaining artistic integrity. The answer has been emphatic. The festival has expanded from eight venues and 40 projects to 22 venues presenting over 250 multidisciplinary projects across eight disciplines: visual arts, theatre, music, dance, culinary arts, craft, photography, and accessibility programming. More than 3,500 artists have participated over the decade.

Over the past few weeks, the U.S. has intensified pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro byconducting strikesin the Caribbean and Pacific waters against alleged drug traffickers and bolstering its troop presence in the region. Washington insists that the operations are part of its ‘war on drugs’, and accuses Mr. Maduro of heading Cartel de los Soles, which the U.S. has designated as a foreign terrorist organisation. The U.S. troop deployment includes two amphibious ready groups with over 4,500 Marines and sailors. The Pentagon has also sent aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford. Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, is hosting F-35 fighter jets and MQ-9 Reaper drones, just across Venezuela’s coast. In October, the U.S. flew a pair of supersonic B-1 Lancer bombers along the coast of Venezuela. It is now evident what Mr. Trump seeks — a regime change in Caracas. And Venezuela’s right-wing opposition, led by Nobel Peace Laureate María Corina Machado, has wholeheartedly endorsed America’s plans. Mr. Maduro, a self-styled socialist, stands accused of rigging the 2024 presidential election, and Venezuela’s economy has suffered a near-total collapse on his watch, prompting millions to flee. He shares responsibility for Venezuela’s current condition. But the U.S. is not an innocent actor either. Washington’s sanctions have been a major contributor to Venezuela’s economic crisis. In the past, U.S. and several European governments had recognised Juan Guaidó, an opposition figure, as the President in a bid to undermine the Maduro government. Venezuela has long been used as a transit route by drug traffickers from Colombia, the source of most of the world’s cocaine. Yet, the U.S. government has not produced solid evidence to link Mr. Maduro to the cartels or to drug trafficking.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned that Ukraine now faces a “very difficult choice”, risking the loss of its dignity or a key partner. U.S. PresidentDonald Trumphas urged him to accept the proposal by Thanksgiving (November 27). Ukraine’s apprehensions are understandable. According to the leaked draft of Mr. Trump’s 28-point plan, Kyiv would be required to cede territory in Donetsk and recognise Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk as de facto Russian. In the other two oblasts annexed by Russia (Kherson and Zaporizhzhia), the conflict would be frozen along the line of contact, effectively allowing Moscow to retain the areas it has seized. Russia would withdraw from the territories it has captured outside the five oblasts and pledge not to attack neighbouring countries again. The plan also demands Ukraine cap its armed forces at 6,00,000 personnel and formally renounce its bid to join NATO. The bloc’s eastward expansion would be halted, sanctions on Russia lifted, while Ukraine would receive “reliable security guarantees”. The plan does not elaborate on these guarantees, but U.S. media said that the Trump administration has circulated a separate three-point plan, promising NATO-style security assurances to Kyiv. Russian President Vladimir Putin has positively responded to the proposal, but Ukraine and its European partners are scrambling to craft an alternative proposal to achieve what they call “peace with dignity”. Several elements of the Trump plan mirror Russia’s long-standing demands, including the halt of NATO’s eastward expansion. On the other hand, the proposal that Ukraine cede territory is not going to be easy for any Ukrainian leader to implement. This makes it enormously difficult for any mediator to craft a peace blueprint that provides genuine common ground for the warring parties.

But by doing so, the Court has acknowledged the severity of the menace that transcends State jurisdictions and boundaries. The Court’s prioritisation of the “digital arrest” scam — fraudsters impersonate police or government officials in a video call, falsely accuse victims of crimes, and pressure them to transfer money to avoid arrest — is fully warranted. The government has estimated that this scam, which often targets senior citizens, has resulted in losses exceeding ₹3,000 crore. The Court has asked the CBI to target not just the scammers but also banking officials who facilitate the creation of “mule” accounts. This is necessary as these scams depend on a malleable financial architecture and therefore require the intervention of agencies such as the RBI, which has also been instructed by the Court to employ Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to trace the “layering” of proceeds through multiple accounts. The Court has also asked online intermediaries to cooperate with the CBI, invoking the IT Rules 2021. The Court is also right in asking the CBI to investigate other scams such as investment schemes and part-time job scams, subsequently. The severity of cyber frauds, as National Crime Records Bureau data indicate, has risen significantly. However, while the judiciary and domestic policing can address the symptoms within India, the problem has another dimension — it is also transnational. The burgeoning of “scam centres” — compounds where trafficked workers, unable to escape due to violence, confiscated documents or debt bondage, are forced to run online fraud operations — in conflict-ridden zones of Southeast Asia suggests that the solution requires robust international diplomacy.

The question practically wrote itself: was the threat being managed here public safety or political embarrassment? Air quality in North India in winter is often discussed as a Delhi issue, yet monitoring stations have revealed a continuous zone of foul air from around Islamabad to Bihar. Emissions from industry, power generation, transport and agriculture circulate in this shared airshed. This is why the India Gate protests are politically significant. Delhi’s middle class has usually responded with air purifiers, closed windows, vacations and private dissatisfaction — but apparently not anymore. And the state has responded by policing rather than engagement. Deploying Rapid Action Force units shows that the government treats these gatherings as a law-and-order rather than a governance problem. North India’s winter smog is the most visible part of a wider national crisis. Long-term analyses of particulate pollution, such as the Air Quality Life Index, have shown that unsafe air is now the norm for most of India — and that present regulation, monitoring, and enforcement arrangements are insufficient across States and sectors. Treating the problem as a seasonal emergency, in the face of evidence pointing to a permanent condition demanding permanent institutions, has encouraged only bursts of action. The airshed is the primary unit of governance. Today, authority is split among central ministries, State departments, municipal bodies and specialised regulators, each with partial jurisdiction and mixed incentives. The Commission for Air Quality Management was created to address this fragmentation and is empowered to direct emissions control, coordinate among States and agencies, and impose sanctions.

Rising for the second day in a row, the 30-share BSE Sensex advanced 447.05 points, or 0.52%, to settle at 85,712.37. During the day, it jumped 531.4 points, or 0.62%, to 85,796.72. The 50-share NSE Nifty climbed 152.70 points, or 0.59%, to 26,186.45. The six-member monetary policy committee, led by RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra, voted unanimously to lower the repurchase or repo rate by 25 basis points to 5.25% and retained a neutral stance, which give room for further rate cuts. In doing so, the RBI seems to have shrugged off concerns over fall in the rupee, which breached 90 to a dollar this week. The RBI lowered its inflation forecast for the fiscal year through March to 2% from 2.6%, while raising its GDP growth projection to 7.3%, from the previous estimate of 6.8%. From the Sensex firms, State Bank of India, Bajaj Finserv, Bajaj Finance, Maruti, HCL Tech, Larsen &amp; Toubro, Mahindra and Mahindra and Infosys were among the major winners.

263,2025,The Hindu,263,"Zero stars: On the Sanchar Saathi app The growing sophistication of cybercrimes, from “digital arrests” to anonymous, large-scale cross-border scams, has made tackling them both urgent and difficult. Cybercriminals have exploited a security gap wherein user accounts on instant messaging apps remain functional even after the associated SIM card has been removed, using this anonymity to conduct government impersonation fraud. The rampant use of spoofed or tampered IMEI numbers has also made tracking perpetrators nearly impossible for law enforcement. It is perhaps inevitable that the government seeks sharper tools to address these software and hardware vulnerabilities, which explains the Department of Telecommunications’ directives on November 28 and December 1. The first mandates“SIM binding”— ensuring that a user’s account is disabled if the physical SIM is removed. In the second,smartphone manufacturers must pre-install the Sanchar Saathi appto verify device authenticity in all new devices by March 2026. While the first directive is a security patch which could inconvenience WhatsApp/Internet messaging users, the second is reminiscent of the saying, the road to hell is often paved with good intentions. The solution to the problem of counterfeit handsets and spoofed IMEI numbers is a cure that could potentially be more damaging than the disease. The explicit instruction in the directive that the app is “readily visible and accessible to the end users at the time of first use or device setup and that its functionalities are not disabled or restricted” would mean thatthis app will be given a higher security clearancewithin the phone’s operating system, allowing it more intrusive access to features such as camera, phone or SMS access.

Successes have been fleeting, top players’ form has undulated and serious questions have been asked of not just the established but also the young and upcoming. But for Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty’sdoubles bronze at the World Championships in Parisin August, there has been precious little. Against this backdrop,Lakshya Sen’s triumph at the Australian Openon Sunday has come like a breath of fresh air. It was not the toughest of fields and the tournament — a BWF Super 500, third in the sport’s hierarchy after Super 1000 and 750 — is not pedigreed. But it was no low-hanging fruit either, for Lakshya had to spend long hours on court, including in the come-from-behind semi-final victory over World No. 6 Chou Tien Chen. The title was the 24-year-old’s first since the Syed Modi International Super 300 last December, and the first outside India since the Canada Open Super 500 in July 2023. Ever since the disappointment of losing the 2024 Paris Olympics bronze medal match from a dominant position, Lakshya has endured difficult times. Injuries and a spate of early exits — 11 in the first round this year alone — had sent him tumbling down. But a trophy in his last act of 2025 should give him the required fillip. Whether this acts as a springboard for other Indians in 2026 remains to be seen. Apart from Satwiksairaj and Chirag, no other Indian is ranked in the top 10 of any badminton discipline.

When they bothassumed their current positions in 2023, it was reportedly based on a mutual agreement which also provided for a mid-term change of guard. Only the central functionaries of the Congress and these two leaders know the exact details of the power-sharing arrangement that was agreed upon in 2023. If indeed there was an agreement that Mr. Shivakumar would be handed over the baton, it is only honourable for that to be enforced by all involved, particularly the party supremo Rahul Gandhi. Mr. Shivakumar has remained loyal to the party through difficult times, facing cases and imprisonment, and accused of corruption by central agencies. While Mr. Shivakumar is valuable for the Congress for his organisational and managerial skills, which inspire confidence among party workers even beyond Karnataka, Mr. Siddaramaiah is valuable for a different reason. His standing as a champion of social justice enabled the Congress to widen and consolidate its acceptance among the subaltern communities in the State. The Chief Minister has dug his heels in, knowing that replacing him with Mr. Shivakumar, who hails from the dominant Vokkaliga community, is not an easy choice for the party. A Vokkaliga at the top can create a rupture in the Congress’s social base in Karnataka, and that works against Mr. Shivakumar. That is the deadlock.

266,2025,The Hindu,266,"The ‘impartiality’ of a nominated GovernorPremium The Supreme Court of India judgment on the role of Governors and the subsequent advisory given by the Supreme Court Constitutional Bench on the 16th Presidential reference have sparked a debate on the letter and spirit of the Constitution. The words that found a place in the final draft adopted by the Constituent Assembly reflected the spirit of the debates that the august House had witnessed. Incidentally, it was on November 26, 1949, that the Constitution was adopted. The debate on the role of Governors in the Assembly was one of quality and substance. Many questions were raised about the office, the role and the powers of a Governor in an independent India. At every turn, Babasaheb Dr. B.R. Ambedkar intervened and clarified the carefully thought-out ideas that had gone into the draft. Doubts were expressed by members about the impartiality of a nominated Governor. They argued that as a nominee of the central government, and not elected by the people, he would be ‘remote-controlled’ and ‘no different from the old provincial governors under the Government of India Act, 1935’. They wanted the office-holder to be above suspicion and feared that they might become a “replica of the Viceroy’s nominees”. Replying to these apprehensions raised by the members in 1947, and later in 1949, before the adoption of the Constitution, Dr. Ambedkar said, “Some members have expressed fear that a nominated Governor will be a nominee of the Centre and not of the Province. I have no doubt that the Governor is required to act on the advice of his Ministers. He is not intended to be an agent of the Centre.” And further, “It must be emphatically stated that the Governor under the Constitution is a purely constitutional Governor. He is there to make the parliamentary system work, not to rival the elected Ministry.” The next major debate that took place was on the discretionary powers of the Governor.

268,2025,The Hindu,268,"Rethinking a symbol of ‘environment responsibility’Premium The global push to ease industrial norms has recently extended to one of the most visible symbols of environmental responsibility — green cover within industrial estates and individual industries. The growing trend of reducing green-cover requirements for industrial estates, units within estates, and standalone industries is often celebrated as a step toward “ease of doing business”. However, the rationale for such relaxation — frequently based on international examples where minimum plantation norms appear lower — often lacks ecological context. While these relaxations may simplify compliance and enhance land-use efficiency, they raise a critical question. Are we mistaking convenience for sustainability? While industrial development inevitably entails ecological alteration, including the clearing of vegetation and habitats, it is critical to recognise that on-site green belts cannot compensate for the broader ecological losses associated with land conversion. Green belts primarily provide localised benefits such as microclimate regulation, dust suppression and visual greening. But they do not restore forest functions, biodiversity or ecosystem resilience. Their role remains mitigative, not restorative. Empirical evidence from multiple regions shows that well-designed green belts can reduce total suspended particulate matter (TSP) by up to 65% and lower ambient noise levels by 10 decibels-17 decibels in industrial or roadside environments. Vegetation acts as a filtering and dispersing surface, improving air quality and reducing thermal stress. However, these gains are spatially limited and cannot replicate the complex ecological services — such as carbon sequestration, hydrological regulation, and habitat connectivity — provided by intact or semi-natural landscapes.

It predates the establishment of post-Second World War global architectures such as the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Bretton Woods Institutions. It was conceived as a secret “oil-for-security” strategic partnership signed on Valentine’s Day 1945 between U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and King Abdul Aziz bin Abdul Rehman al-Saud on the USS Quincy in the Suez Canal Area. Originally intended to last 60 years, it was renewed in 2005. Thanks to the exceptional amity between U.S. President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MbS), this arrangement is currently being reset to the new domains of strategic cooperation, with the potential to anchor bilateral, regional and global developments in a more consequential manner. During the past 80 years, U.S.-Saudi ties have not always had smooth sailing. First, thanks to shale technology, the U.S. has become the world’s largest producer of crude and a significant exporter. While this has reduced the commercial content of the relationship, the U.S.’s exports have remained steady, leading to a decline in the bilateral merchandise trade and a balance swinging in America’s favour.

There was one survivor passenger. Nineteen persons on the ground lost their lives, making it the first crash of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner since its introduction into commercial aviation.

In the history of airline operations, there have been very rare instances of a dual engine failure on take-off.

Therefore, any national plan must be matched by real and coordinated action across all levels of governance. The first National Action Plan on AMR, launched in 2017, was a significant step forward. It brought AMR into national consciousness, encouraged multi-sectoral participation, improved laboratory networks, expanded national surveillance and supported stewardship. It also placed AMR firmly within a One Health framework, recognising the links between human health, animal health and the environment. Despite this progress, implementation during the first plan period remained limited at the State level. Only a small group of States — Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Sikkim and Punjab — developed formal State Action Plans, and only a few moved meaningfully into execution. The majority continued to rely on fragmented activities within individual sectors; State-wide, multisectoral One Health structures did not take shape in most parts of the country. This slow uptake was not due to a shortage of national effort, but because the major determinants of AMR fall under State jurisdiction. Health administration, hospital functioning, pharmacy regulation, veterinary oversight, agricultural antibiotic practices, food-chain monitoring and waste governance are controlled by State departments. National guidance alone cannot create uniform implementation when the operational levers sit elsewhere.

President Zardari approved the summary submitted by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, formally asking him to appoint Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Munir as the first CDF of Pakistan. Last month, the parliament passed the 27th Constitutional Amendment providing to create the post of CDF with the objective to create unity of command and expedite the decision making in any critical situation. The CDF replaced the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), the post for which was abolished. The President extended his best wishes to Mr. Munir, a release from President’s office said in Islamabad. Mr. Zardari also approved a two-year extension in the service of Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmad Babar Sidhu, Chief of Air Staff, to take effect from the completion of his present tenure on March 19, 2026. According to a statement by the PM Office, the Prime Minister had earlier approved the summary for the appointment of Field Marshal Munir as the army chief and the CDF, and then referred it to the President House. Field Marshal Munir was appointed as COAS in November 2022 initially for three years, but his tenure was extended for five years in 2024. The decision to issue a formal notification has put to rest rumours regarding delay in the appointment of the CDF, which was due since November 27, when the last CJCSC General Sahir Shamshad Mirza retired.

274,2025,The Hindu,274,"The letter has won but the spirit has not lostPremium The Republic of India has had 15 Presidents over 16 presidencies, its inaugural President, Dr. Rajendra Prasad having served two terms. Of the number of Governors appointed since 1947, the figure is too large to be counted. The holders of these two high offices can do great good, sometimes not a little harm and very or most often, prefer an almost Advaitic selflessness that leaves no mark whatever — a self-protecting mechanism. It is better to be not remembered at all than remembered negatively. I have often wondered why these high functionaries, when they are males as they invariably are, carry pens in the pockets of their coats. The pen is almost a piece of their essential ‘getting ready’-ness. It makes them seem ever-ready to sign the paper put up to them, wherever they are. The master cartoonist,Abu Abraham, immortalised the 1975 momentwhen the then President signed the proclamation of the national emergency by a searing cartoon that showed him signing the paper when it was brought to him (this time with the stylus) at a very odd moment. Signatures can be affixed all too easily, when what is required is saying, ‘No, very sorry, but no.’ The reason may be plain gratitude for being where the Excellency wants to be. An Abu Abraham cartoon featured in the show Abu’s World held in Bengaluru in 2024.

Because, if the foundational principles are allowed to crumble, the remaining structure will wither away. Further, the institutions which sanction such an obliteration of core ideas, almost always meet the same end. Once the tree falls, the branches cannot survive. The Supreme Court of India has done just that, while answering the16th Presidential referenceon the powers of Governors and the President of India. The core philosophy of federalism, ingrained in India’s Constitution, lies eroded and buried. The States will gradually become shadow Union Territories with Legislatures but dependent on the dictates of those in power in the central government. Federalism is a vital safeguard in addition to being part of the basic structure of the Constitution. Sounding the death knell for federalism would precipitate the absolute dominion of the Government of India over the remaining institutions that seek to control, regulate and quash arbitrariness and the autocracy of those in power at the Centre. Under the constitutional scheme, the Union and States are equal partners, with the Government of India being only ‘first among equals’. States are not subservient to the Union Government, nor are they secondary appendages, bound by the diktats of the Government of India. In fact, in all areas in the State list (such as land laws and law and order), they enjoy complete autonomy. Any other understanding of federalism in the Indian context would disrupt and violate the constitutional scheme envisaged by the framers of the Constitution.

276,2025,The Hindu,276,"A dismantling of the base of environmental regulationPremium On November 18, 2025, in CREDAI vs Vanashakti, through a 2:1 majority, the Supreme Court of India reviewed and recalled its judgment from May this year, where it had declared notifications permitting persons to secure ex post facto environmental clearances (ECs) as illegal. The original judgment was hailed as a landmark moment, as a rare instance of the Court grounding its rhetoric in enforceable discipline. But the Court has now asserted, with a strong dissent from Justice Ujjal Bhuyan, that its earlier ruling misinterpreted binding precedents and failed to appreciate that retrospective ECs may, in some situations, further the cause of public interest. Our immediate reaction might well be to ask how? To answer this, the Court employs a wholly circular logic. As the then Chief Justice of India, Justice B.R. Gavai put it, to entirely deny retrospective clearances undermines public welfare because it could well compel authorities to halt or tear down completed projects that had begun without prior permission. Thus, the illegal act is, by itself, turned into a justification. The fact of a violation — of a project unlawfully commenced without an EC — winds up forming the rationale for granting the very clearance that the law requires in advance. In other words, the rules become fungible, to accommodate a fait accompli.

To argue that the victory resulted from a fortuitous combination of many factors appears less attractive. Analysts are tempted to search for game-changers so that a dramatic-looking outcome can be explained by equally dramatic looking new formulation. The victors, on their part, need the big story because such a story feeds into a narrative that can help them beyond the immediate terrain of the electoral victory. In the recently held Assembly election in Bihar, which resulted in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) winning nearly half the votes polled and bagging nearly 90% of the seats in the Assembly, this State election appears to be a case where some key factors must have produced this scale of victory. With the Opposition taking exception to the last-minute scheme for the benefit of women which had been devised by the State government and cash transfers taking place right around the time when the actual campaigns kicked off, the women’s vote stands out as the key factor that gave the NDA its massive victory. The fact that women outnumbered men in terms of voter turnout, has added more plausibility to this argument. Another factor, according to at least some circles, is the young voter. Their overwhelming support, it is asserted, helped the NDA register this dramatic victory.

The global nuclear arsenals have come down from a high of 65,000 bombs in late 1970s to less than 12,500 today. And, despite concerns in the 1960s that by 1980, there may be at least two dozen states with nuclear weapons, the total today remains nine — five (the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France and China) are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council who had tested before the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) came into being while four more developed their nuclear arsenals later (Israel, Pakistan, India and North Korea). Looking back, these would seem to be impressive achievements but nobody is celebrating. In fact, the prevailing sentiment is that the global nuclear order is under strain and the recent announcements by U.S. President Donald Trump may weaken all three elements of the global nuclear order. On October 30, 2025, on his way to a meeting with China’s President Xi Jinping in Busan,Mr. Trump announced on Truth Social, “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately.” He added, “Russia is second, China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years.” While it was clear that the message was directed at Russia and China, it was unclear whether Mr. Trump was referring to ‘nuclear explosive testing’ or the testing of nuclear weapon systems.

The lecture was given during a two-hour cruise on the Krishna river on Thursday (December 4), as part of the programme ‘Know Your Heritage-Culture Cruise’, organised by the Vijayawada Chapter of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH). Around 60 people took part. The speakers, authors Vadrevu China Veerabhadrudu and Sree Padma Holt, talked about the concept of village goddesses in A.P., how they have been reimagined and interpreted by devotees over the years with changing times and how they were finally incorporated into Shaiva, Vaishnava and other belief systems. Tracing the origin of Goddess Kanaka Durga, Padma Holt, an educator and researcher who taught in Bowdoin University, the U.S., talked about how the goddess is an amalgamation of many forms and was a grama devata at first, then a tribal goddess, then she was worhipped as the destroyer of the evil and protector of the people before being worshipped in the present form.

The case of Lieutenant Samuel Kamalesan, dismissed from the Indian Army for refusing to enter the sanctum of his regiment’s temple or gurdwara during mandatory parades, is one such clash. The Delhi High Court upheld the dismissal (Samuel Kamalesan vs Union of India), and the Supreme Court of India declined to interfere. The legal result is clear. The moral unease remains. The Court relied on military necessity, discipline and the power given by the Constitution under Article 33. The judgment places his refusal within the frame of disobedience of a lawful command rather than the practice of personal faith. Seen through that narrow lens, the courts acted exactly as they believe they should in military matters: defer to the generals. But that deference should not end the national conversation. When two legitimate values collide — conscience and cohesion — the tragedy is not simply that one side must lose.

This resolution recognised the critical role of comprehensive care and support policies, aimed at reducing, redistributing and valuing unpaid care and domestic work, to the well-being of society and all its members — in particular, children, older persons and persons with disabilities — more so, as a disproportionate share of care and domestic work is undertaken by women and adolescent girls. It also remains invisible, undervalued and unaccounted for in national statistics, and neglected in economic and social policymaking. India has had a long history of care provision with institutions outside the family emerging in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the work of educationists such as Tarabai Modak and Gijubai Badheka. These pioneering efforts, with developmentally appropriate practices, gradually declined as modern childcare provisioning emerged post-Independence. With modern childcare mostly in the private, voluntary sector, low-income families, those who needed childcare services the most, were excluded.

High inflation, above a tolerable level, is a regressive consumption tax that affects poorer households more disproportionately than the rich and households whose incomes are hedged. Indeed, high and volatile inflation hurts savings and misdirects investments. The issue of acceptable level of inflation came up first before the Chakravarty Committee which was of the opinion that “…the acceptable rise in prices is 4 per cent (reflecting changes in relative prices necessary to attract resources to growth sectors)….” The reasoning given is somewhat opaque. The RBI has been focusing on inflation management all along, and more explicitly since the dismantling of automatic monetisation in 1994 that gave functional autonomy to the RBI in conducting monetary policy. In 2016, India adopted the FIT framework that also gave, in a broad sense, institutional autonomy. Since 2016, India’s inflation is range-bound, by and large, despite facing multiple shocks. This is an achievement for a framework that is still evolving. An issue that keeps recurring is the issue of what to target — headline or core inflation. If the overall objective of inflation control is to promote savings and investments and to protect the poor from shocks, then headline inflation should be the appropriate target. The assumption that ‘food inflation’ is only the result of supply shocks is not necessar",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/flexible-inflation-targeting-a-good-balance/article70280847.ece
289,2025,The Hindu,289,"Inter-State rivalry that is fuelling India’s growthPremium Last month, whenGoogle unveiled its plansfor its largestArtificial Intelligence (AI)data centre outside of California, U.S., in Andhra Pradesh, Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu gleefully claimed bragging rights — a global tech titan choosing his State for a marquee investment over regional rivals such as Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The jubilation in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, could be heard across State borders. In Tamil Nadu, a former All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam Minister chided the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam-led Stalin government for failing to woo Google, although it is headed by a true-blue Tamil. Across another border, a Karnataka Minister suggested, with barely concealed envy, that Andhra Pradesh had lured Google with “extravagant subsidies”. Strip away the politics, though, and what you see is something profoundly healthy — competition among States for investment — a potentially powerful engine for growth. For the first time in decades, Chief Ministers are not queuing in Delhi’s corridors of power, but are in boardrooms of multinationals and corporate conclaves, persuading investors that India’s best destination is their State. To appreciate this shift, cast your mind back to pre-1991 India. For four decades after Independence, capital investment was largely a political decision made in New Delhi. The “commanding heights” of the economy were occupied by bureaucrats who dispensed patronage through licences, permits and quotas. The country’s industrial geography was determined by political calculation rather than market forces. The Centre decided what should be produced, how much should be produced, and, crucially, where it should be produced. States, on their part, vied for investment not by wooing potential investors but by wooing politicians in Delhi. Thereforms in 1991changed that. By dismantling industrial licensing and opening India to trade and investment, liberalisation shifted power — at least partly — from the Centre to the States.

290,2025,The Hindu,290,"Institutionalising animal representationPremium Any meaningful conversation about the political representation of animals must begin by challenging the deep anthropocentric assumptions embedded in modern political thought. The core issue is not just cruelty but also the structural design of democracy itself, built on a rigid division between “the human” and “the animal”. This foundational split, the original political boundary, positions the animal as the non-subject as it is non-rational, non-political, and a being reduced to “mere life”. Across history, this single, simplified category of “the animal” has collapsed a vast plurality of non-human worlds into a negative mirror against which human superiority is defined. Language, reason and political agency were claimed for humans by denying these to others. This act of categorical “othering” is what enables the institutionalised exploitation of non-human beings today. The task, therefore, is to expose the artificiality of this division. Animals are not a homogeneous mass but a heterogeneous multiplicity of beings whose lives impose distinct moral and political obligations. The problem we face is not a deficit of compassion but a structural flaw; democratic institutions treat animals as property, creating an institutional vacuum where their interests are never represented, measured or defended. This legal erasure is the root of systemic violence. Maneka Gandhi calls SC’s order on stray animals 'impractical' Over 50,000 citizens write to Supreme Court against stray dogs order Bombay High Court upholds animal rights over religious customs in elephant custody case Politically, this means that animals cannot remain passive objects of charity. Their lives place a demand on the political community; they make humans morally and politically accountable. Representation is not about granting animals anthropocentric rights such as voting. It is about formalising the representation of absolute vulnerability and unchosen dependency within democratic decision-making.

291,2025,The Hindu,291,"The infirmities in the SIR of electoral rollsPremium The Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls (SIR)ordered by the Election Commission of India (ECI) in 12 States and Union Territories(Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Puducherry, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and Lakshadweep), where elections are due, has provoked strong protests from some State governments — some have challenged it in the Supreme Court of India. The SIR was conducted in Bihar earlier, beginning in June; the Assembly election has just been held in the State. The Opposition had opposed the SIR in Bihar on various grounds which included the haste with which such a massive exercise was sought to be done. The Opposition challenged it in the Court on the ground that, inter alia, the ECI’s power to conduct such an extensive revision after a summary revision done as recently as in 2024 was unconstitutional. Although the Court made some interim observations and directions to protect a voter’s right, the constitutional issues have not been settled. The ECI claimed, while justifying the SIR in Bihar, that the last SIR had been conducted in 2002-03 with demographic changes since then due to large-scale urbanisation, migration and death. Therefore, it was necessary to revise the roll comprehensively to reflect the latest demographic picture in the State. The ECI, no doubt, has the statutory right to conduct a comprehensive revision of the electoral roll. But the question as to why it should be done just a couple of months before elections to the Assembly has remained unanswered. The point is that intensive revision involves a massive exercise of enumeration which requires enumerators to visit every household and collect data, deal with claims and objections and decide appeals. In fact, between 2003 and 2024, there have been five general elections to the Lok Sabha and many elections in the States and Union Territories. But the ECI did not conduct an SIR anytime during this period, which i",,,,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-infirmities-in-the-sir-of-electoral-rolls/article70267813.ece
292,2025,The Hindu,292,"New Delhi’s relative isolation, India’s tryst with terrorPremium The current period might well be viewed, or termed, as India’s moment of reckoning. For one, India today — and despite its highly regarded diplomatic skills — increasingly appears more like an ‘outlier’ than a major player in world affairs. It has been virtually sitting on the sidelines when it comes to issues involving peace and order in different regions of the globe, especially in West Asia and Europe. It is also a virtual onlooker as far as the emerging situation in the Indo-Pacific is concerned. Seldom indeed has India faced a situation of this kind. If this was not bad enough, the entire South Asian region in which India is situated, appears to be in turmoil at present. Afghanistan and Nepal are among the countries on India’s periphery that appear to be most affected, but from the Maldives to Myanmar and further afield, India can hardly count on many friends and allies. This is a frightening scenario given that each day produces a range of new threats, including cyber. Currently, India has to contend with two openly hostile powers on its western and eastern flanks — Pakistan and Bangladesh, respectively. In the case of Pakistan, the threat level has been going up steadily, with a growing cacophony of voices being heard in that country to teach India a proper lesson. What is aggravating the situation further is theapproval of the 27th Constitutional Amendment Billby Pakistan’s Joint Parliamentary Committee of the Senate and National Assembly, which has altered the precarious balance between civil and military authority in that country. India’s interests are best secured by strategic autonomy: Jaishankar at JNU India’s strategic autonomy in a multipolar world Also, a recent amendment has introduced the concept of a new ‘Chief of Defence Forces’, elevating Field Marshal Asim Munir as the nation’s military supremo, and the commander-in-chief of all three services, having sole control over Pakistan’s nuclear assets.

293,2025,The Hindu,293,"The lower judiciary — litigation, pendency, stagnationPremium A Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court of India, headed by the Chief Justice of India, recently linked the sense of stagnation in the subordinate judicial service to prolonged litigation and the huge pendency in India’s courts. According to the National Judicial Data Grid, there are 4.69 crore cases pending in district courts. Another Bench of the Court has asked judges in Delhi to undergo training due to a lack of basic knowledge. There are a few options to make changes in the administration of justice. The Code of Civil Procedure and the Civil Rules of Practice contemplate procedures to be followed by courts in entertaining proceedings, issuing summons to the defendants, and for the appearance of parties. Subordinate judges handle this. They are forced to call every suit for the appearance of parties or order the issue of fresh summons and receive vakalathnamas. This takes up much time in the morning, leaving judges with very little time for the disposal of cases on merits. In most subordinate courts, the calling of cases goes on from 10.30 a.m. till well past noon. Quality time is lost by attending to such clerical and ministerial work. A judicial officer in the lowest rank in hierarchy can be appointed in every district court to call all the cases of that particular cadre of courts (senior civil judges or civil judges or district munsifs, as the case may be). This court can do ministerial work the whole day and can also be assigned with the power to record ex parte evidence, issue of summons, receiving vakalath and written statements. At the end of the day, this court can list matters for trial and arguments the following day in each court. This list can be posted on the website in the evening. The cases can be taken up, as in this list, from 10.30 a.m. every day by each court, and these courts can dispose of matters listed till evening. Even if some matters are adjourned, the orders can be still dictated, thus helping in judgements and case disposal.

Maheshwar Rao on Thursday conducted an inspection of ongoing last-mile connectivity and footpath development works along metro corridors in the South Corporation limits. During the visit, Mr. Rao reviewed the integrated footpath project from South End Circle–Abhaya Ganapathi Junction to Sangham Circle and instructed officials to complete drainage work and cobblestone laying on a priority basis. The GBA chief noted the functioning biogas plant near South End Circle and the newly established Dry Waste Collection Centre and asked officials to prepare a comprehensive plan for waste management, including proper entry and exit facilities for waste-collection vehicles. Mr. Rao also inspected the K–100 citizen waterway, walking along a 2-km stretch from Anepalya Junction to Shantinagar Bus Stand, and instructed officials to prepare a comprehensive plan to completely prevent sewage from entering the waterway. He noted that sewage inflow has been largely controlled in many parts of the K–100 stretch and asked the Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) to survey remaining areas with uncontrolled inflow and submit a detailed solution plan immediately.
